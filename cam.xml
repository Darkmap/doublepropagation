<Content>I have been holding on to my old 3MP Canon for years now because I swore I couldnt get a better picture from a compact camera.  I finally broke down with the birth of our twins since I knew I would need a good point and shoot to go along with my DSLR.

Once again, Canon did not disappoint!  This camera takes phenomenal pictures.  I suggest getting a Class 6 SDHC card for this camera as I have seen some slower responses from Class 4 cards.

<Content>I needed an upgrade for my SD400, which just didnt do the job anymore.  After much research, I decided to purchase the SD880 which is a highly rated camera that is being replaced by the SD960.  Still, the SD880 outperforms its replacement!  I love that my no-flash, low light photos come out beautifully and the presence of the image stabilization is a great invention!  No view finder but I dont need one.  The video so far has been very nice (1:30 length) and I hope to use it more.  I got the gold color, which is lovely, because it was $35 cheaper than the silver.</Content>

<Content>I have 3 Canon SD cameras all from the digital ELPH series and this one is by far the best. What attracted me was the massive screen and 4x optical zoom (the most Ive experienced thus far is 3x). While not a photography buff by any means, I am savvy with electronics and can appreciate a fine gadget such as this camera. The SD890is turns on very quickly and can take a picture within seconds. The pics come out very clear especially compared to similar compact cameras from Sony and Nikon and previous SD models. The red-eye removal and trimming features are also fantastic! For someone such as myself who will red eye in about every picture this is an excellent tool. 

Physically the camera is impeccable, the folks at Canon really know how to design an aesthetic device. Optical zoom while filming a video would be a great addition, however. One piece of advice if shooting a video is to avoid the zoom feature at all costs unless you zoom BEFORE you start recording. Otherwise, the Canon will take an otherwise decent quality video and turn it into a blurry mess. 

Another happy Canon customer!</Content>

I have taken many satisfactory pictures which I cannot do by my other cameras. Maybe the only shortcoming is it can zoom in or out only digitally whle taking video.</Content>

<Content>The superior performance of the SD880 is largely confirmed by its popularity in Amazon sales, its close-to-retail pricing, and by reviews such as those by the NY Times David Pogue and, more recently, the most popular and respected consumer magazine.  If I were a practical sort, I would immediately select it ahead of other Canon models in the SD series for 2008 as well as 2009.  Not only does it employ Canons newest processor but it has a lens with sufficient range and aspect ratios to be considered wide angle.  This means that you can get those tight group photos (which frankly present themselves more frequently than telephoto close-ups).  Moreover, if youre using, say, video mode, you dont want to physically move backwards, taking the camera with its pinhole microphone with you, because that reduces the chances of picking up some interesting conversation or dialogue that could turn out to be as valuable as the visual evidence.  And some of the principles of the old photography still apply: a wide angle lens will give you greater depth of field, thus assuring sharper focus on all of the objects in the picture.  The SD890 has an even wider angle lens than the SD880 and, given the sizable price discounts, is difficult to resist.  Nevertheless, it uses the previous processor (Digital 3 rather than Digital 4), has not been reviewed as favorably by the professionals, and is one of the few Canons to go with a plastic body (no doubt a major consideration in professional reviewers lack of enthusiasm for the camera).

The SD780, lthough touted as the successor to the Lilliputian SD770 and listing practically the identical dimensions, is actually more diminutive than the specifications would suggest.  Even the cardboard box it comes in is 30-40% smaller than the container that accommodated the SD770.  The camera itself looks smaller than the SD770 and is conspicuously lighter in weight.  Its definitely a sexy, sleek, ingeniously designed device that some of us (namely, moi) are apt to fall in love with despite some necessary trade-offs due to its size.  Not a smidgeon of space is wasted on front or back, and it takes a bit more time and practice simply to locate and use the viewfinder.  The flash unit, moreover, is smaller than that of the SD770, and hence slightly less powerful.  The camera is so petite, in fact, that one cant overlook the danger of dropping, misplacing or simply losing it (check for holes in pants pockets before slipping it in). Perhaps the most common misjudgment of many users of these cameras is to equate smallness with convenience: at least initially, patience and care are the key.  When Im in a rush, a Canon A410 (3.2 mp) is the first camera I go for.

In sum, the form factor is the major consideration with the SD780 whereas the SD880 is as much about performance as style.  If you need practical reasons to rationalize selecting the SD780, HD video capability has got to be first.  Since I dont have room to carry a Flip or any other gear in addition to what I already have, Im using the SD780 as a videocam more frequently than I thought I would.  The results--at 720 pixels--are quite satisfying if not impressive, especially considering the minute size of this mini-overachiever.  As for the 12.1 megapixels of the SD780 vs. the 10 of the SD880, thats probably best seen as a non-factor or mere sales hype.  The SD880 registers less noise in dark conditions than the SD780, which is likely to translate into more consistently stellar results.  All the same, the SD780 is capable of competing with its bigger brothers, especially if a thoughtful photographer holds up his or her end.</Content>

<Content>We have professional cameras that are very nice, but are also heavy and bulky.  We needed something small that was functional and easy to use for those times that we just wanted to capture memories, not get professional images to enlarge for artwork.  This little camera definitely fits the bill.  We also like the 3 LCD and the movie capability.  Were traveling to Italy in a month and will enjoy using this camera!</Content>

<Content>I did a lot of online research, and this Canon came up as the universal winner for this year (early 2009) at this price point...not just at the tech sites but also the photography sites that I respect. The photography sites rarely review compact cameras as they are mostly focused on SLR and Pro-sumer equipment. However, when they do look at compacts, I think their reviews can be extremely valuable. Anyway, the research has paid off:

- stlll picture quality is excellent for family pics, sports, work, travel, dinners, etc.

- video quality is rather good (not HD or anything approaching), but really nice for viewing on a MAC or PC.

- controls are easy typical cannon layout

- zoom is good for a camera of this small size

- flash is fine, not great...its a compact

- downloading is a breeze via simple USB (no cradle nonsense)

- build quality is very good  very solid. However, Im not a fan of the black plastic rear housing...but, its fine as it is high quality plastic. I like metal all the way around the camera body better.

Overall this is really a very good choice, and IMHO one of the best out of the 100+ digital compact cameras available that I sorted thru online reviews.</Content>

<Content>Nice wide angle.  Nice big screen.  When you power it on, it powers up really fast.  But when you click the shutter, theres a significant time lag before the picture is taken - ah, well.

How in the world do you force the flash on, like a fill-flash?  Its definitely not obvious, but we havent checked the manual yet (although, usually you can figure out that kind of stuff).

Great photos, though!</Content>

For now it looks like the SD880IS is another product that will stay with me for 3 years.

<Content>Canon PowerShot SD880IS 10MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)

Received my 880 last week... after putting it through some tests, Ive come to the following conclusions:

- Easy to operate
- Clear pictures with accurate color
- Setup of custom specs are fairly easy, requiring some manual referencing
- Inside, outside, differing lighting, shots are nice.

Reading other reviews attesting to poor picture quality, dust motes/orbs, etc, made me a little nervous about my choice - since working with the product the negatives have thus far proven to be unfounded.  If a person wants better pics.... get an SLR.

Im satisfied, the camera does what I want, easily, quickly and with excellent results.</Content>

The lens is not as quick as the older model and the focus system takes to long in deciding when it is time to take the picture.  This can make action shots very difficult to take.  Im going back and am going to look for the older model which was much more efficient and better constructed.</Content>

<Content>Ive been a computer/software trainer for 20 years in a K-12 school and public libraries.  Ive trained teachers, librarians, and the general public in the use of their digital cameras, and I can safely say that its about the best point and shoot camera you can get for the money.

The LCD is huge, making it very easy to frame your subject.  The controls are all intuitive and easy to use.  The pictures are sharp, and the colors are extremely accurate, in most situations.

Im personally impressed with its ability to take photos in low light conditions, where most family type pictures are taken.

However, the star of the show is the 28mm lens!  When people purchase a camera of this type, they are mainly looking for one that works well indoors for such activities as birthdays, candid shots of the family, family reunions, graduations, etc.  This wide angle lens will take in most, if not all of the action.

The 10MP lens is more than enough for excellent photos of all sizes.  It would be nice if the Optical Zoom was stronger, but it works in most situations.  I recommend turning off or not using the digital zoom on any camera because it usually causes blurry photos when not on a tripod.

All-in-All...Nothing but Thumbs Up for the Canon PowerShot 880.  Besides ours, both of my daughters have one and are the shutterbugs of their friends.  They both love their cameras!

<Content>I havent used 880 for long but so far I love this model. The wide angle is the best thing a camera can have. Colors are great. I was worried about the battery life since it has the huge 3 screen but to my surprise the battery life is great. Shutter lag is minimal compared to my old canon. I never used any other brand so can not say if canon is really better than them but I know one thing. I love this camera and it will be my best buddy till the day it stops working. (My old canon worked 5 wonderful years!) 

Pro: Wide angle, battery life, large screen( with hard plastic protection) ,Zoom during video shoot
Con: It will take a little time to get used to settings. Every time I am playing with it I learn something new!

<Content>Ive owned about 6 Canons in the last 6 years, and this is the first one I have been disappointed with.

-The wheel SUCKS for changing modes. There is a delay because it insists on showing you the mode your in before letting you change modes. No matter how I try, this never seems consistent. Ive always used the ability to switch from Auto to P or M as a fast way of having two different settings at the touch of a button. Most significantly flash/no-flash and high-res/low-res. 

-You can no longer have different resolution/compression settings associated with Auto and Program modes. 

-The picture quality does not seem to be as good as before. 

-The video format has changed to .mov. 

Otherwise its basically the same as all the others. Besides the wheel, the button layout is solid.

<Content>I recently ordered this camera from Amazon after much researching. Many sites stated it as one of the best (or the best) point and shoot compact camera. I had also read reviews that it was grainy and had a lot of noise. But Ive been a satisfied Canon digital camera user for years, and was sure that stellar reviews would outweigh the bad ones.

Taking it out of the box, it looks and feels like a serious piece of technology. Good metal, solid heft.

Well, after trying it out and uploading the images to my computer, I can see why there were some unsatisfied customers out there. I never shot in 10mp. Only 6 or 4 mp setting. I shot Auto, Program, Macro, Sepia, Indoor, etc. And opening them in Photoshop, I found the quality extremely poor. This is really disappointing. I have a 3.1 mp old Canon digital that shot much better shots than this one. I dont even need the 10 mp. I dont need the high ISO. In fact, even on Program setting where I kept ISO at 200 or 100, the shots were STILL grainy at 100% in Photoshop. They look great on the LCD or the download. But when you open them and view them at 100%, its muddy, noisy, grainy. Details were not sharp.. images are soft.

These shots were outdoors on clear, sunny days. I also found the color to be not as vibrant as my old Canon digital. I had my photos taken under Program at 200 ISO and White Balance at Daylight. Also took photos inside all on Auto. 

I wish Canon would go back to a good solid 6 or 8 mp non-complicated point and shoot. I dont need all the bells and whistles. But I do like having some manual control of exposures and such. 

Sadly, Im packing this up to return. And digging out my old 3.1 mp to see if I can unstick that toggle and get it working again. </Content>

<Content>I bought an SD800 a couple of years ago and am a happy customer.  I thought SD880 should have all the SD800 features, plus other enhancements (3-in, more resolutions, etc.)  To my disappointment, SD800 took out the video zoom-in and zoom-out feature - which is very important these days.  People use compact camera to video shooting a lot these days!  I also took pictures with tripod under day lights and indoors with same or close settings on both SD800 and SD880.  My amateur friends all gave thumbs to SD800; one of my semi-professional photographer friends used color calibrated professional monitor for comparison and found SD800 shows a better clarity and more details than the SD880.  This shows a less density sensor is better than the higher one.  On actually really doesnt need 10MP for a SP camera.  What a disappointment!  How come a newer model (SD880) gets released by Canon with one less important feature and inferior quality than its old model (SD800)? </Content>

<Content>A lot of the commentary Ive read seems fairly accurate.  Photos in the daytime are terrific - extremely clear and vibrant.  Night photos have a tendency to come out fuzzy and blurred.  That said, the camera has a bunch of neat pre-programmed settings that Im still exploring which hopefully will help to correct some of the fuzz.  I experienced the lens error once that people have commented on, but it was simply because the lens was obstructed when opening ... I simply turned the camera off and on again and the issue went away.  All round, the camera is very easy to use, its extremely quick to focus and shoot, and Im pleased with the purchase.</Content>

<Content>With 190 reviews already posted I probably cannot add much new. Camera is easy to use, fast in operation, and takes excellent very sharp pictures. All in a package smaller than a deck of cards.  Wide range (28-112) on zoom is major plus.
Very easy to transfer images to computer.

Ive had the camera for less than a month. If anything goes sideways, Ill report back. 

One spec item you might want to look carefully at is picture quality at various ISO settings. Many point  shoots picture quality fall off after ISO 200. That is pretty low.  Per Consumer Reports, the 880 goes to ISO 400.  </Content>

<Content>I wanted a versatile compact camera in a small package.  I also own the Canon XSi, but lets face it, there are times when I dont want to lug around a DSLR and all of the lenses, so I first tried the Powershot G10.  It was a nice camera, however I experienced a little too much blur, unacceptable noise (especially at higher ISOs), and it was a bit bulky.  So I returned it and decided to get a smaller, less versatile camera with great image quality. After exhaustive research, I decided on the Elph SD880.  I feel I made a wise decision. Image quality is great in just about every shooting condition.  I shot low light, bright light, indoors, bright sun, macro, full auto and program mode.  All performed wonderfully.  My images are sharp with little or no blur (except under certain obvious conditions), and the noise levels are acceptable. Brightly lit shots are usually noise-free, however, things do tend to get a little noisier as the light fades.  Although there is more noticable noise at higher ISOs, general setting shots look great, and even most of my low-light shots were better than expected.   I would say the noise is on par with my expectations, unlike the G10.  Honestly, my test SD880 images have significantly less noise than the images I took with the G10.  I tried every trick in the book to try to improve the image quality of the G10 (because I really liked the features and wanted to justify keeping it) but 14.7 megapixels is going to definitely reveal any shortcomings.  I know a lot of people think the new Digic IV processor is noisier in general than its predecessors.  Both the SD880 and G10 have this new processor.  This is my first Canon PS since 2001 (Powershot A20), so I cant comment on the validity of that.  However, I do believe you reach a megapixel limit before quality is affected with the small sensors in point and shoot digicams and the SD880 seems to be right at that limit.  If the Digic IV actually is noisier than preceding digics, then this flaw is much more pronounced on the higher resolution G10 than the SD880.  I took identical shots with both cameras and the SD880 images were clearer with less noise. My shots look good enough that I feel comfortable saying as a fresh buyer that I dont think the Digic IV is flawed.  It may not be as good as its predecessors, but its not flawed in my opinion.  I havent noticed any significant chromatic aberration and Ive experimented several times with challenging shots attempting to trick the camera.  Ive noticed it a few times under extreme shooting conditions, but thats to be expected at this end of the camera spectrum.  

I opted for the silver color because the gold seems a bit garish for my tastes.  The camera is super small, powers up and is ready for the first shot very fast.  I havent noticed any significant lag time betweeen shots.  For the tiny form factor, this camera performs just as well as the larger and sometimes more expensive competition.  If youre looking for a tiny, pocket camera without sacrificing quality, this is the perfect choice.  I will admit that movie mode was a crap shoot.  I shot three videos.  Two were crystal clear and hard to distinguish from footage taken with a traditional SD videocam, however one was pretty grainy, even in bright light.  The problem seems to be focus.  There doesnt appear to be autofocus in movie mode.  If you begin filming out of focus, it will stay that way for the duration.  It does allow zooming while filming in movie mode, however, it remained out of focus.  Movie mode delivers good results, just make sure you properly focus before pressing the shutter button.  

Although I sacrificed a few desired features such as RAW mode and additional programmable options, I still think this is the perfect camera when you just want something to slip into your pocket and move about freely.  The large anti-glare LCD is nice and clear, although you might want a soft lined case to protect it from scratches.  The settings menu is easy and intuitive.</Content>

<Content>This camera has an amazing quality lens on it.  

I have a high-end SLR, and I bought this little pocket camera for my wifes birthday.  I have to tell you that the quality of this little camera is nearly as good as the SLR.

With that said, when youre out taking pictures, dont think about equipment limitations, think about creative images.  When youre in that mindset, this little camera excels!  It has several interesting preset modes that allow even a beginner to take extraordinary images.  My favorite preset is the Digital Macro mode.  This allows you to be able to focus on objects that are VERY close to the lens.  Be careful:  You can focus so close that you will have to make sure you dont bump the lens on your subject!

The wide-angle lens is more practical than the telephoto end of the spectrum, so I would get this camera again in a heartbeat when compared to even newer variants of this camera.  The wide angle lens on this camera will help you capture family gatherings, holidays, and stunning landscapes.

The camera has a nice telephoto range, but its practical application is limited.  Im not saying that it is incapable at that setting, just that you will find yourself using the wide-mid range far more often.  Get this camera for that purpose.

Get this camera!  Youll love it!

<Content>Were Not happy with this camera.  My first Canon camera was a S400.  After 8 years of use, it needed a repair which was a known defect so Canon covered all shipping and repair costs.  We purchased the SD880IS in February 2009 and the PCB Assembly was inoperative 3 months later.  We hardly even used it!  We used the camera heavily for 3.5 days out of those 3 months before it broke.  Very disappointing.  Dont Buy!  Dont Buy!</Content>

<Content>I have read the negative reviews of the SD 880 IS and can only conclude that there must have been a small batch of cameras that were defective since the majority of evaluations were positive. I have owned a number of Canons and they have been excellent. I have had the 880 since last November when I passed my SD 870 IS down to my son. I wanted the new features and they have proved very beneficial. The picture quality, especially sharpness and color saturation, are exceptional especially when enlarging to letter sized prints. I recommended this camera to a friend of mine and unfortunately he had the black screen experience mentioned in one of the negative reviews. Before the problem, however, he took over 800 really beautiful pictures in Egypt, Jordan and the Holy Land.
I hope Canon rectifies the defects in manufacturing as I am a big supporter of these wonderful little cameras.</Content>

<Content>My wife wanted a new camera for over a year and after much research, I found the Canon SD880 to be the best camera for the money in its catagory.  After we received the camera, it definitely lived up to expectations.  It is so easy to use, takes fantastic pictures, and the huge screen is great for viewing.  The only thing we wished it had is a viewfinder for those shots in super bright direct sunlight against the screen but the screen is bright enough where you can usually still see the shot well enough.  I know the model up from this has it but if my memory serves me right, we still choice this one over that one because I think that one had a smaller screen to add the viewfinder.  Overall, super camera!</Content>

<Content>I have only had the Canon SD880 for a couple of weeks and have yet to read any instructions.  It is simple for taking pictures and once I read some instructions I am sure I will be able to do the in-camera editing it is capable of.  Out of the different possible settings for taking a picture, it doesnt seem to have a sports setting.  I tried using the 3200 setting, but it just didnt do the trick for the pictures I was taking at my grandsons track meet.  I did use it for a day at Epcot and the colors were great.</Content>

<Content>I found myself in need of another compact point and shoot. I started reading reviews and comparing cameras for about a week. I finally went to a local store for some hands-on time and I was sold. 
The camera feels good when held and shouldnt be too small unless you have really big hands. The rotary pad Canon put on the back is perfect. All cams should have this. 
Now most importantly, the image quality is spot on for a camera in this range. Its no D_SLR but thats NOT the point here. You can pull this camera out of your pocket and get a really good looking shot with no fuss. The wide angle, F 2.8, and IS really help this thing shine. Many say that Canons color approach is too aggressive but I think its fine. I actually use custom and turn up the contrast and saturation. 
The whole point of this camera and any like it is to get the best looking pics right out of the camera.

Pros: 
Takes good looking shots. 
Easy to use. 
Feels good when held and the controls are well done. 
IS and the F 2.8 lens.

Cons: 
Noise can show up if you let the camera choose ISO. (mostly in dark situations) But then again with the size of the sensor any cam like this shows noise. 
No HD video. (really just an afterthought anyway)</Content>

<Content>This lives up to Canons quality.  It was easy to use.  Just turn it on point and shoot.  The camera takes excellent pictures in low light unlike its competitor Nikon.  I had a Nikon coolpix and I hated it.  Canon has none of the problems the Nikon had.  Canon takes good pictures in low light (incandescent lighting), it reloads its flash quick so you dont miss any cute pictures of quick moving toddlers, and when you use the zoom the built in image stabilizer (IS)ensures you have focused pictures.  I just cant say how happy I am with this camera.  The large lcd screen on the back is just wonderful and the dial on the back to change from point and shoot to where it is more manual is easily identified.

<Content>I bought this camera a few months ago and have been extremely pleased. I use it for photo documenting buildings and building equipment for the green buildings reports that I create. Many of the photos that I take are in equipment rooms or even inside pieces of equipment where lighting is minimal to nonexistent and where room to move around in is very tight. The wide-angle lens  and Digital macro modes are lifesavers for me. I installed an 8 GB memory card and it can hold almost 1800 pictures at 10 megapixels each or up to about 45 minutes of video. I dont have to worry about space anymore. I can just snap pictures at will and sort them out later. The photo stitch software that comes with it is also great for taking pictures of a high-rise buildings or a very low and wide warehouse of himand ending up with everything in one photo.
 This is at least the fifth camera Ive used for business (not including the old Polaroids we used to use a long time ago) and I can tell you hands down that this one is the best by far. The optics are very good, it has plenty of functions, and the big LCD is excellent.
  My recommendation is to pick up a small, convenient carry case that will hold an extra battery, and the camera and NOT to get a case thats large enough to also carry the battery charger (the charger is almost the same size as the camera) and AV cords otherwise it will be too cumbersome and youll want to leave it behind. My case is made by Swissgear and protects the camera very well.

I take between a 100 to 300 pictures and about 10 minutes of video every day and sometimes I can get by with only one battery for the whole day though sometimes, I have use my backup battery. 
 If you pick up an extra battery, get the one made by Canon and not by an aftermarket company.  The Canon batteries are 1000 milliamp hours where the aftermarket batteries like the one I have from Digipower are only 850 milliamp hours (I havent used up two batteries even with less power from the aftermarket batteries). 
One last thing, buy the 8 GB SDHC card. Theyre cheap enough now to not blink an eye and you can take pictures for days without having to download them in between. I mean seriously, almost 1800 high-resolution pictures!

This is a terrific piece of technology, easy to use and capable of taking excellent pictures without the user needing to know every detail of its many features.  I bought it because of the great review in the New York Times and I have no regrets.  The only tiny complaint so far: unlike my old Kodak you have to remove the battery from the camera to recharge it.

<Content>I love this camera! Im not a super techno geek. I just wanted something to point and shoot and then love the results. I got it! The 880 has a fast shutter response, thats what I call the time between when you press the button  the shutter actually takes the picture. Its almost as fast as an SLR! So I dont miss that strange face the kid just made. Its lite and small, it fits in my cell phone holder. The view screen is large and bright and you can zoom on the view screen, no downloading it to see it bigger! The optical zoom is only 4X, but the 10MP give you such detail you can blow it up  get great pictures! The videos are good but the playback volume is too quiet to hear. There are many features I havent used yet because my 15 year swiped it to use in a digital photography class at school. I only paid $250 for it at Amazon, but the salesman at Best Buy said it was his favorite camera but Best Buy had stopped carrying it!? Go figure! I say Get the Canon Power Shot SD880IS!

The panoramic is awesome, we take a lot of landscape pictures and that function is really handy, although it is just knocking off the top and bottom rows, the formatting on the screen is more help-full then cropping it yourself.  I do recommend the bigger memory card, this camera has no limit to the video other then the card itself.  When put into the specific modes, the difference is apparent right away on the large lcd screen (no viewfinder).  Custom settings are... very technical.  I love it, would recommend it to anyone who does not want to mess around with changing lenses.</Content>

<Content>Very happy with the camera.  Actually zooms to around 9x but image best at x4. Very small, light, well built and takes excellent images.  I havent even opened the manual yet but managed to charge the battery, install the memory (bought an additional 4Gb card as the 32Mb card is a little limited), took photos and downloaded them all to my PC.  Very easy to operate, intuitive to use.  </Content>

<Content>We got the 870 (this cameras predecessor) before a trip to Italy last fall. Its a great snapshot camera; the wide angle is handy indoors and for landscapes out of doors.

But heres what was astonishing to me. I shot pieces of sculpture in Florence, and when we got back I decided to see what would happen if I blew them up to poster size. The 8 megapixel jpegs held up extremely well, in focus with very little pixellation, even blown up to 3 foot square images! Im not sure it would have been discernibly better shot with our Nikon DSLR -- and this is a tiny Elph! 

I concluded that Canon optics must be really outstanding in this class of camera -- and we already know that their processing is the best in the business. What a wondrous technical achievement -- and Im sure the 880 is just as impressive as our 870. No wonder Leica is being driven out of business -- they simply cant compete with this.

<Content>Overall this product is definitely nice.  My last camera was a 4 MP Nikon Coolpix with a tiny LCD view 1 or 1.5 maybe? that I absolutely loved until I dropped it. My intent was to go back to Canon as I had an Elph (non-digital version) before and I felt like the pictures/color were brighter and more defined. Also, I had compared my boyfriends 8 MP Canon pictures of the ocean and others from our January 09 trip to the Riviera Maya to my Coolpix and there was no comparison in colors, his pictures were so much better. I intended to get an 8 MP as I primarily take photos of my daughter and dont need anything that fancy. I wanted something with a faster shutter speed to catch those moments with children when playing.  The two salesmen at Best Buy talked me into this camera showing me how it has continuous picture taking abilities - perfect for kids and moving objects. At 10 MP and one of the newest and higher priced models I wasnt sure, but bought it anyway. (I had gone there for a different Canon on sale, (the 1100) but they talked me out of it). Anyway, I came home and before using it researched the internet to find other user comments (which were mixed) and Amazon was by far the cheapest reputable/known site and there was no sales tax or shipping charges. The no sales tax saved me about $25 alone living in Chicago at a 10.25% sales tax rate.  Anyway, this camera is nice - the 3 LCD makes me a bit nervous because it is so easy to damage if you are not careful, as it takes up almost the entire back of the camera. The one thing I really DO NOT LIKE about this camera is the video feature. I constantly take videos of various things - mostly my daughters dance or swimming class, but the video is terrible! Not only is it very grainy the microphone for the camera is right next to the zoom button.  So, if you need to zoom anything, you hear the noise of your finer scraping back and forth across the speaker/microphone. You can use the video okay if you dont need to zoom, but any zooming expect a grainy picture and the noise. I bought a Video Flip to carry in my purse separately to alleviate the issue. Also, I know I went from 4 MP to 10 MP, but plan to buy at least a 4-8 GB SD memory stick because my 1 GB was useless after a few weeks (without videos). Finally, dont get the camera case that goes with this camera. The snap on the inside for the way you need to put the camera in goes against your LCD making the possibility to scrape or damage the LCD highly probable. Also, it has no storage for extra battery or SD card if you are one to carry a spare.  Had I not dropped my camera and really needed a new one right away, I might not have bought this camera, but it will do for what I need it to do minus the video. Hope this is helpful to you. Amy   </Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera two weeks ago from Amazon. I noticed that in pictures using the flash, there were spots. These turned out to be dust orbs in the pictures (lens flares). This happened in more than half of the pictures. So I returned it for an exchange, thinking the camera was not functioning correctly. I got the replacement the next day in the mail. I took 11 test pictures using the flash in clean rooms (normal environments). All 11 pictures had dust orbs, some more noticeable than others, and more than half rendering the picture unusable/unacceptable. While it took good pictures otherwise, and good video, I could not use the camera forever without using the flash. I would think twice and possibly invest more $$ in a better camera. They just came out with new models so try them.</Content>

<Content>I spent considerable time doing research before purchasing this camera.  I looked at all brands and between Consumer Report reviews and talking to other Canon owners decided to go with Canon.  Then the real fun began.  Comparing one model to another, as well as reading all the reviews.  While this camera cost more than I started out wanting to spend, in the end the Canon PowerShot SD880IS was the one I wanted to own.  I have been using it for about a month now and so far so good.  Initially when I looked at the manual I thought I might have to take a course just to use it.  I was wrong.  You can use it right out of the box without making any changes.  The manual helps you tweak it if you are one that wants hands on control.  I like the feel of it in my hand, and the 3 inch LCD screen helps to see what you are shooting. I could say more, but I dont think anybody wants to read that much more.  At any rate check out the other reviews and read the description on the camera.  Then buy it.  Chances are strong you will like it. </Content>

<Content>First, I would like to say that I love Canon cameras and have owned many, including an SD1100 that worked great for me. 

I have owned the SD880 for 3 weeks (bought from Amazon).  I am currently on the trip of a lifetime to Rome and Paris. Today, at Pompeii, I was on a great tour and all of the sudden my LDC screen went black. The menus and playback still work, but the screen for taking pictures is totally black and the pictures are also black.  The camera was in its case in my pocket at the time. It was not dropped and did not get wet. This problem is widespread and well-known on Canon cameras (Google Canonblack screen problem), although not many SD880s have developed the problem yet. It took the Canon S2s around 2 years before they started malfunctioning in droves.  I am luckily within the return window and will do so ASAP and order something else. Thanks Canon for ruining all of my picture taking on my trip to Europe!</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera on sale for 199.99. Probably the best compact camera I have ever used. The image quality was almost comparable to my dSLR camera but without the size. The scroll wheel and the functionalities are all excellent in regard to location and ease of access. Camera startup is a little on the slow side due to the need for lens to pan out, however the battery is strong enough to handle the always on and lets you capture shots instantly. Video mode is super clear and with great sound recording as well. This camera also features a super huge lcd monitor and it is crystal sharp! You can zoom in and move across pictures as if using a magnifying glasses on a piece of real film. 
The only thing id say is to buy a lcd screen protector for 1 dollar and cover that beautiful screen. It is the eyes of the camera, protect it well.</Content>

<Content>Excellent camera! Wide angle lens is the best feature-with pcs  software you can zoom in, crop,  edit but you cant zoom out! You need to get more in the picture to begin with, especially group pics of family, friends, co-workers,  pets when in close settings like an office or kitchen area. The wide angle is also great for shots of the Grand Canyon, mountain ranges, and fields of bluebonnets in Texas. The wife  daughter have the Canon SD1100s for their small size and colors. My sons have the Canon SD870(predecessor to the 880 and they have the wide angle lens also). All take excellent pictures in auto or manual and are feature laden with easy menus. Old Dad got the 880 since I take more pics than all the others combined and am the default photographer at work and at home for Xmas, etc. Do get an extra battery and invest in a good,well-padded protective case, not some glorified, leather dust cover. Put the wrist strap on every time you shoot! Its like cheap dental floss saving you from paying the big bucks at the dentist. So simple to do and like flossing, so few actually do it. You will like any Canon camera, but you will LOVE this model!   </Content>

<Content>I did significant amount of research on the current state of digital cameras and the Canon Powershot SD880IS was at the top of almost every list. After reviewing all of the cameras features, I decided that I would check it out at the store. I looked at Nikons and Panasonics and Sonys and many other Canon models (why the need for so many?) but kept coming back to the 880. The wide angle lens, 4x zoom, speed, and ease of use convinced me that it was worth spending $250 to get a camera that works. Ive owned it for several days now and it is extremely simple to use, sits well in the hand, and takes excellent pictures. </Content>

<Content>Pros
- Excellent view finder/photo viewer screen.  Very good resolutionon the display.  The brightness of the screen adjusts based on situation.  Easy to see images even for old eyes.

- I have quickly figured out key functions without reading directions (one of my buyer values.

- I like the zoom as you take the photo as well as the zoom on the resulting image.

- small enough to slide into my pocket like my Blackberry.  However, the buttons are intuitive enough that I can operate the small camera.

- We had a nice (expensive) Nikon from about 7 years ago.  It was going to cost $150 to fix.  We decided to put money into new camera.  This was a good choice.  Cameras have improved a lot.

Cons

- Occasionally I accidentally navigate into a mode or function on the camera that I dont understand (partly my issues because I havent read the manual).  I simply turn the camera off and back on which gets me back to normal mode.

<Content>I hesitated a bit in buying this camera. It was between it and the SD790. The reviews I read said the SD790 took  some of the best pictures of any compact camera but was a little slow. And they said the SD880 was fast, took great pictures, had a wide-angle lens--- but had a few noise/fringing issues. I just couldnt pass up the wide-angle lens though--- and Im glad I didnt!!!
Took it to Miami this weekend and it took incredible pics! Love the wide angle. I did have a few dust bunny issues with some indoor shots. But over all it took way more great pictures than it did bad ones. Some of these pictures make it look like Im a pro! This camera is AWESOME!</Content>

<Content>I have had the sd870 for a few years and LOVE it..love the wide angle...and everything else about it.but it broke (sand in the gears).  I was psyched for an opportunity to get this upgrade.  

However, I have been very disappointed.  It takes forever to take a picture from turning it on until the shutter goes if it is a flash picture.  My subjects get pissed!!   Also, the flash pictures are almost always overexposed.  This never happened with the 870.  I usually set it to Program mode with -2 exposure compensation and it works fine...but I have to reset it every time!  this is a royal pain.

I am just frustrated and angry about this camera.

Not a major gripe but the wheel concept is cool but it is cumbersome.  The settings can change too easily and spinning it to the right place is a challenge.

<Content>Day 1:
The camera has a big problem:-
The pictures are almost always blurred. I have tried both outdoor, indoor and acquarium shots with their respective settings.

Now you may think that my expectations are too high from this camera. Not so. I am comparing the image quality of this camera with my former cheaper FujiFilm camera 3800, which was not only cheaper (cost me $150 about 4 years ago) but also only had 3M pixel resolution. So much for Cannons 10M resolution.
The only downside with FujiFilm 3800 is that it consumes power even when it is off, there must be some current leakage. I fought that by taking out the batteries when not in use.
Hopefully I will find a setting on this Canon that gives a better image otherwise I am sticking to my FujiFilm 3800.

---------------------------------------
Day 2: OK I have tested this camera under full sun condition and pictures are still pathetic. I am returning this camera, the product is poor and defective as far as I am concerned.

<Content>I am not a camera expert or anything. I am just a regular married mom with 2 kids who takes pictures.  This is my 3rd camera in about 6 years (all canons I must add) and I am so in love with this one. It is small and compact. It not having a viewfinder took some getting used to. I love the color (gold) and I love the features..... at least the few I have been able to figure out and use.  I did do my research (for months) before chosing this, and I am pleased with my choice.  Pretty pricey though. But I guess you are paying for the brand name.  I would strongly recommend this for anyone looking to buy a simple point and shoot camera.</Content>

<Content>Ive owned a canon powershot sd1100 before and loved it, so after a recent burglary in which my old powershot was stolen, I went ahead and found this new one. 

I bought the camera from amazon and just received it today. I was so excited to get it out of the box, but right after I charged the battery and took my first test shot using the zoom on the lens, the camera froze and displayed lens error, please restart camera. After numerous attempts to restart my camera (turning on and off the camera, taking the battery out and putting it back in, etc) the lens would just not retract and the error message would not go away. Now Im left with the defective camera and the frustrating task of returning it... 

I guess it could have just been my camera, but thats just some food for thought before you buy this one... Im super disappointed and upset because I was really looking forward to using this new camera! :( 

*UPDATE: Since my last post Ive received my new powershot. Amazon was super helpful and sent out my new camera right away after I told them I called Canon  Canon tech support said it was either defective or damaged during delivery. My new camera is performing well. I have to agree that it does make some noise while zooming in  out (more noise than the old model I had), which made me quite nervous at first because I thought it was going to die on me again, but the picture quality is extremely clear and I like all the different settings. All in all, Im satisfied with my new functional camera and think that it was a pretty good deal. Ive had a cybershot in the past and I still think that Canon still makes better cameras with better picture quality.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera because my Canon EOS Digital, while very good and takes great pictures, is just too big to take everywhere we go.   This Powershot is great for skiing, which we did last weekend, and to the beach, etc.  It fits in your pocket easily and is very easy to use.  There is a SCENE setting where it automatically adjusts the parameters based on what scene you are in - beach, snow, action, dark, etc.  Very cool.  The pictures come out great.  I recommend this camera.  Note: the memory card it comes with only holds about 10 pictures so you will need to get a bigger one.  I got one at Best Buy, a 10G for $13.  It holds over 1000 pictures at the biggest pixel setting. </Content>

<Content>I have always liked Canon products, and the 880is keeps up the reputation. The LCD is huge and sharp, there are tons of features and it is very easy to use.  I think that the image stabilization may have worked a little better on my 870, but it is hard to tell.   I like the rotary wheel for selecting menu items - saves countless button pushes. 

The main reason I bought this model was for the W I D E angle lens - absolutely necessary for travel photos, and this one performs very well.

Do not buy this camera:

1)Slow 
2)Picture quality unacceptable for a Canon with the new processor DIGI 4
3)Image stabilizer a joke.
4)MOV video format, very uncompatible with most software.
5)Useless ISO 3200
6)Inacurate batery meter
7)Image stabilizer work for hand shake NOT for picture stabilization.
8)Toy power Flash, so tinny flash works only in closer pictures.
9)SCN function absolutely workless.
10)Microphone located in top of camera, so you will easly block the microphone with your fingers when try to take videos.

<Content>Ive had this camera for three months now.  I happy with the picture quality and operation of the camera.  But the Canon sofware used to download images to your computer is poor - it is slow and non-intuitive compared to the similar Nikon and Sony software that I have used.  Video files in particular are slow to download and view.  I have lowered the megapixel setting on the camera to medium (around 6-8 megapixels), thinking that this might improve the performance of the software, but it didnt.  If you download a lot of images, you might want to consider another brand. </Content>

<Content>I was nervous when I started the process of trying to buy a new camera because there are so many to choose from and the rate of improvement seems almost to be almost monthly.

I picked this camera because:
It has a wide angle lens, this can make it better for taking pictures in rooms as you can get more in the picture.
It takes video, I wanted to be able to make simple videos without having to drag a larger format video camera around with me wherever I go.
It records sound along with the video as well as simply acting as a sound recorder, this lets me record conversations without the need to always take notes.
It is ultra compact, this means I can carry it everywhere I go using a belt clip so I dont miss a snap because I didnt want to carry a camera.  Im lazy like that.
It is manufactured by a camera company and not a computer company, the implication being that the optics are in theory better.

On using this camera I discovered:
It lived up to all the above points and is also really easy to use, point and snap or get picky about specific settings.
The video is really high quality and with the 16Gb memory card I also bought, it can in theory take up to 4 hours of video.
The battery seems to last a long time.  I bought a second which I keep just in case in the case.
The picture quality is excellent, I certainly cant fault it and the screen is remarkably bright and large. 
The camera comes with a charger that you plug the battery into directly.  As the camera itself only comes with a 32Mb memory card, I purchased an additional card.  This card coming with a USB stick enabling me to plug it straight into my PC.  Therefore I discovered I needed no cables needed at all.

Negatives:
Not much, I would have liked a jack for an external microphone.  
There does not seem to be a wide screen Video mode, though there is for still photos.  

Summary:
By the time I bought an extra battery, 16Gb memory card, leather belt clip case and a table top tripod I had still spent less than $300.00.  I therefore think that this camera was a great deal.

Here is a my first video I made with this camera! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyFMiB4h6_w

<Content>I always lean toward Sony products and own two larger Sony digital cameras.  Seeking a compact, I bought the Sony W150 and returned it due to inconsistent picture quality. After reading several favorable reviews of the SD880 (Steves digicam and www.Kenrockwell.com), I ordered it from Amazon.  My experience affirms the strong ratings.  It is a very impressive camera.  Image quality is excellent; the 3 LCD is crystal clear and the controls are very intuitive.  This is one camera that you can use immediately, almost without reading the instructions. I like the wide angle lens, the face detection and anti shake; 4x optical zoom is acceptable. The camera provides the capability to lock in features using the P mode.  I like the vivid setting and the grid lines which really help improve landscape shooting.  The in-camera red eye correction works very well, avoiding the need to use Photoshop for this common correction. Indoor shots are pretty good but the use of artificial lighting is recommended as a supplement to the flash whenever possible; also, use the indoor setting in the scenes mode for better quality images.  When shooting video clips, you cannot use the zoom but this minor shortcoming can be overcoming by just walking closer to the subject if you need to zoom in.
While this is a matter of personal taste, the gold color, actually a champagne, is very attractive and gives the camera a classy appearance. 
All in all, a most impressive camera for its size. Highly recommended.
As usual, Amazon provided the best deal with a 4gig SD card included in a price that was very competitive.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for my wife for a Christmas gift to replace an older PowerShot model we have had for years, and have been nothing but impressed with it. 

The easy-to-use interface and large viewing screen have made it a cinch to operate. The wide angle lens is especially nice because it makes you feel like youre capturing more of the actual area of the scene you see with your eyes. 

We enjoy how small and compact it is and the rechargeable battery packs hold their charge for weeks at regular use. Its quiet when in use and tucks neatly away when not.

The photos it takes are nothing short of beautiful. The adjustable resolution settings are nice when all youre looking to capture are snap shots, but up to the task when you need a large, high resolution image for the scrapbook or screen saver.

Im certainly not a camera expert in the sense that I can talk the lingo, but I do know a nice photo when I see one and I recognize that this camera takes very nice photos for any level of user. Nicely done.</Content>

<Content>This is my third Canon and i was really looking forward to having all the latest tech updates in this model. However when taking pictures i noticed a certain softness in the focusing and quality seemed kind of grainy when viewed at %100. I compared identical pictures taken to with my old SD700IS and they were noticeably clearer and less noisy. I even compared them at similar resolution with no improvement. I even used a tripod and tried various exposure settings to see if i could make a difference. Maybe its a software thing or they are using different algorithms cause i noticed similar complaints from other users. I might try to order another one to see if it was just a fluke. At least i got a full refund. Good luck!</Content>

<Review>
<DocID>B001G5ZTN6-138</DocID>
<Content>For the pixel peeper set and those serious about image quality:

The image quality of SD880IS fell a little short of my expectations. My last camera was a Canon S70  (7MP) which is now quite old, but it still produces better per-pixel sharpness, except wide open in the corners, than the SD880IS. Some limitations of the SD880IS for those serious about image quality are

1) The DIGIC IV chip will perform noise reduction at all times, even in bright daylight at ISO 80, reducing detail in areas of low contrast; you cant turn it off.

2) No manual modes means living with sub-optimal aperture selection, further reducing sharpness.

3) The auto exposure is much more likely to clip highlights in contrasty settings than on the S70; be ready to use exposure compensation of -1/3 to -1 to avoid blown highlights.

4) Whether its optics or DIGIC processing Im not sure (its not shutter speed), but I frequently have image areas that are smudgy when viewed at 100%, effectively reducing the amount of information in the 10MP file to something similar to a sharp 6MP file.

5) The movie mode shows very visible vertical streaking at each specular highlight, not just on the display while filming (not unusual), but on the stored file as well. Neither the S70 or G9 have this problem.

With 4 years separating the S70 and SD880IS, I was expecting a real noticeable improvement in image quality. If its there, its not very noticeable. That said if you never print  8x10 youll probably not notice these issues.

In all other respects, however, the camera performs nicely and shows the progress expected of the intervening years. Speed of operation is good, display very visible in daylight and image stabilization allows one to handhold very slow shutter speeds. Barrel distortion is noticeably lower and CA and purple fringing are better controlled. Flash power is good but recycle times are slow, as is the continuous shooting rate.

Given the information available at the time of purchase, it seemed this camera was clearly a good choice (dpreview, NYTimes). Furthermore, it satisfied specific constraints of the person I was giving it to: small size, large and easily visible screen, wide angle lens. </Content>

<Content>I had been using a 3.2 mega-pixel Sony Cybershot for the last 5 years.  The pictures always came out great but it was clearly time to upgrade.  I bought the 880.  Immediately I had problems with a message that kept coming up to change the battery pack even though it had been fully charged.  This happened several times.  Then it stopped.  I then found that the photo color was completely inadequate.  In taking the photo of a sunset I would use the convenient sunset setting on the camera.  It washed out the sky to the point where you could not see the sunset. I tried the sunset setting with and without flash and it made no difference. I finally pulled out my old trusty cybershot and took the sunset which came out looking perfect, as I could see with my naked eye but just couldnt get the Canon to see it.  I find that really odd.  I also found that photos of people were very washed out.  I was unable to adjust the strength of the flash.  If I were to take a photo of a person Id have to try 4 different automatic settings just to get one good photo.  I never had this issue in the past and its very inconvenient.  I loved the size of the camera and the large LCD screen.  I also enjoyed the color swap feature however I did find that it seemed slow and I got more blurred pics that I expected.  Overall I am returning the camera and will replace it with something better.  This just doesnt work.</Content>

<Content>Ok, so Im not a professional photog or anything like that.  I will stay away from some of the traditional, confusing jargon that I ran across when agonizing over reviews when I purchased this camera. My family has owned one digital camera, this is our second.  We wanted a good all-in-one solution that we could use for trips/special occasions.  We had a Canon before, which lasted for 4, almost 5 years before the LCD went out.  I was pretty pleased with our last one and Canon earned a seat at the table of consideration when it came to buying a new one.  Here is the bottom line:

Things I like:
Color Swap  Color Accent Functions
28mm wide angle option
Pillow Top Button Controls (unlike other Canon models I considered)
Quiet Zoom when shooting video
Accompanying software

Things I would improve:
More optical zoom
Ability to film video in more formats
Wrist strap is tricky to attach

The one thing I can say is that I havent really had the opportunity to run the battery down, so I cant speak to battery life....yet.  I have also not mastered the iso settings for night time shots, so I cant speak with a great deal of knowledge about those.

One suggestion which I would offer you is to consider how much the accessories cost with different brands of cameras (memory cards, replacement batteries, etc....). Some companies require special memory cards that or more expensive or their battery costs are excessive.  This models low cost of ownership (thats what I call it) and Canons reputation made it an obvious choice.  Its the same principle I employ when considering a good printer....how much the cartridges cost, etc.....  Overall, I think its a good bang for the buck.

<Content>I asked a professional photojournalist for a recommended camera and found her advice was perfect. It takes expert photos so I dont have to. I just point and shoot. It knows to focus on the faces and adjust for indoor lighting. And the photo files are 4mg so I can blow them up big which I sometimes have to do. A cool feature is when taking a self-timed picture, you can set it to take 3 photos in a row. This was great for the holidays, taking a family portrait of 15 of us. It increased our chances of getting everyone smiling. A great camera!</Content>

<Content>Images are spotty, grainy, and sometimes blurry. I send it to Canon for repair; they changed the lens assembly. However; that didnt solve the problem. There was no change in image quality. Canon tech support asked me send it back for second time. This time, they paid for shipping. I didnt get it back yet. I will update my review when I get it.

Some googling revealed that some units of this model are defective, so buy it at your own risk.

I would like to give some credit to Canon technical support. Although they send me the camera without solving the problem, they have been very friendly both times and redeemed themselves by paying for shipping.

<Content>I bought this camera to replace my old SD-1000 (which replaced my SD-660, which replaced an S-330).

My first reaction was not positive, only because the camera is larger and heavier than my previous Canons. What I liked the most about my last two cameras was their elegant, light, slim design. The SD880IS is nicely designed, but has noticeably more heft and is thicker.

Once I started taking pictures with it, I forgot about the increased size. Its faster than my SD-1000 in taking consecutive pictures, and performs much better overall, especially in low light. Whenever possible, I try to take pictures without flash, because I find the images to be more natural. Because of its more sensitive imaging chip, the SD880IS allows me to take more hand-held low light pictures than I previously could. The increased sensitivity, however, comes with increased grain in very low light situations.

The revamped controls took a little getting used to, but quickly won me over. No more needing flicking a switch to put the camera into display mode.

If you take any panoramics or landscapes, youll love the wide angle lens on this camera, which is equivalent to a 28MM lens on a 35MM SLR. The zoom lens, now 4x, instead of the more common 3x in older models, does not actually provide the ability to zoom in closer to your subject. Instead, the additional x makes up for the wider lens. This means that at full zoom, my old SD-1000 with a 3x lens, and the SD880IS provide the same frame.

If the camera were lighter/thinner and produced less grain in very low light situations, I would have given it 5 stars as being perfect.

Pros:
Faster than previous models.
Revamped interface simplifies use.
Light sensor more sensitive, more useful in low light.
Wide lens, great for landscapes, large groups, etc.

Cons:
Heavier, thicker than many previous models in same category.
In extreme low light conditions, sensor can produce a lot of grain.
Requires new battery type (cant use left over batteries from older models)</Content>

<Content>This camera was a totally unexpected Christmas gift from my hubby. I was a little concerned because he is technically challenged and me being a gadget girl, I was sure I was in for disappiontment, boy was I wrong!!! This camera is not only beautiful (love, love, love the gold color) plus it came with a package deal had a METAL neckstrap, leather case and an extra battery.

The camera has so many features I am not sure I will ever use many of them. You will definitely need to read the manual to get the most out of your camera and afterwards, it didnt take me long to figure out how to change all the beepings, tickings  timers so that I could use the continuous shoot mode. I havent used the video mode or the self-timer as of yet but the still pictures are beautiful and I love the nice screen size....... So, if you are looking for the perfect camera then do yourself a favor  buy this one, you will not regret it.....

<Content>This camera comes highly recommended on many websites, and for good reason.  The sleek design, easy-to-use interface and sharp picture make for a great point-and-shoot option.  The only complaint I have is that while taking outdoor night photos, the flash picks up a lot of dust orbs.  There are some ways around this, but it might be irritating.  However, to a self-described photog like myself, this camera never leaves my pocket.</Content>

<Content>Love it!  I dont understand why the market doesnt demand more selection of wide angle cameras like this one.  Seldom do I wish I had more zoom.  Usually, its I cant back up far enough to get the whole scene.  

At least these days there is PhotoStitch thats free from Canon.  It allows you to merge several individual narrow angle images into a single wide angle one.  It works wonderfully but unfortunately its a big time burner, so thats a main reason I like my new camera.

Secondly, the quality of the video mode - compared with the PowerShot I bought several years ago - is a huge improvement.  Its not the same as a video camera but this model has moved a lot closer to being one.

Have enlarged many of the photos from the sd550 and they look great. I dont really want to carry the larger camera because of the great quality with the smaller cameras and the ease of their use. I wanted the wider lens on the sd 880. It is great! better than the 550 since the wider lens is good for outdoors and architecture photos.Great movies also. Got the 4gig sdhc card from amazon for like $18 which was a deal. I was looking at the sd990 which is over 14 megapixels bout it does not have the wide lens. This none is great. </Content>

<Content>Before I bought this camera I read all the reviews that I could find.  I had almost decided on the Canon A590 until I came across the SD880 IS.  I own a previous elfh (SD600) and still love it but wanted to upgrade to a newer model.  I have the Nikon D40 also but didnt want to lug it around all the time when Im traveling or for quick shots.  I must say that I couldnt be happier with this model. It produces great pictures under any circumstances.  I was really surprised at how powerful the flash is.  I took pictures in a completely darkened room and they came out crystal clear.  A few I will post here on Amazon.  I have not had any problems so far as others have stated.  I have always been intrigued with cameras so when I find one that really thrills me as this one has, I like to share it with others.  If you are trying to make a decision on which model to purchase maybe this will help.  I am 99% sure that you wont be disappointed.</Content>

<Content>I was very disappointed in the photo quality of SD880 too. I previously owned the A520, A530. The pictures were very clear  sharp, The colors were very good too!!I loved Canon  took A530 with me wherever I went.

Because Canon A series cameras may have the Battery Low problem  it happened in my A530 half year ago, So, I did my homework  brought SD880 in 11/2008. 

I was so disappointed about the qualities of all 400+ pictures I took. I compared them with my A530s pictures which I owned for 2 years. The SD880s pictures are blurry, the objects edges were not sharp  unclear, The wide-view feature twisted the objects on both sides of the pictures. The colors were not as bright  nature as A530s. Another thing was not easy to hand hold it  easily mass up the set-up by touching the bottoms unnoticed.

But Amazon was nice enough to let me returned it a week ago. I believe there is trade off the picture quality with the thin design. I think I will buy A590 from Amazon.com after the return process complete.

<Content>I just received my SD880, after having previously owned an SD750 that I handed down to my Mom.  Ive played with the SD880 for all of a day, so I can hardly add much to the previous detailed reviews.  I have a digital SLR already (Canon 5D) but its heavy and bulky, and Ive found a need for a pocket camera I can take everywhere, when I dont want to lug around the 5D.  Plus I can use it as my (only) video camera.

The SD750 was nice - I took it to Italy when I bought it as a pocket camera.  In the SD880 I looked forward to a wider angle lens and Image Stabilization - two glaring issues I had with the SD750 (where I NEVER seemed to be able to get far enough back).

The SD880 seems much more responsive (faster processor) in interactive use than the SD750 and of course takes nice pictures.  However, one HUGE disappointment is that the SD880 does not have a time-lapse movie mode!!!  Time-lapse may seem like a gimmick if youve not used it, but I found it incredibly fun on the SD750.  When in Italy I used it with my tripod to record some fun videos such as tourists at the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and that was my favorite video shown to my friends from my trip.  I may have reconsidered my purchase (or gotten last years SD870 instead) had I known this feature would be removed - I just assumed this would be a standard feature since it was in the old SD750 and is still in their other consumer cameras.  I dont really need the extra Megapixels.  I feel cheated.

Otherwise, I look forward to having a compact walk-around camera that takes nice pictures.

<Content>I purchased a SD880IS in Gold for myself for Christmas.

Wow ! It is just a fantastic camera. 

The camera is stylish, well built, compact, feature rich. The gold color metal front and brown plastic back look very nice.

Picture quality is excellent with bright, vivid, sharp photos.

The *NEW* DiGIC 4 processor does a fantastic job in processing your photos. This is Canons newest and latest processor and it does a rip roaring job. The camera has a very snappy start-up and time between pictures response.

Great features:

10.0 Mega Pixels ( plenty of resolution )
4X optical zoom
28mm wide angle lens
Nice Big 3.0 PureColor II Display ( Looks bright and sharp, even outside )
Face Detection Technology
Intelligent Contrast Correction ( NEW feature, really helps you to take better photos, VERY USEFUL )
Motion detection technology and servo AF ( a must for kids  pets )
Takes good movies with sound at 30 fps
ISO 1600 ( good low light shots without flash )
Fantastic NEW DiGIC 4 Processor

The included documentation ( User Manuals ) are very good. The camera works well with a PC or Apple MAC. ( We have 3 Apple Macs in our house, but I tried it at work with a PC. ) Canons warranty and support is excellent. I have had other Canon cameras repaired by Canon and they were fantastic.

I have not tried or used the included software as I use the Apple iPhoto software for working with photos.

I highly recommend the Canon HF-DC1 High Power Flash accessory for this model or any other Canon pocket cameras if you intend to take many indoor shots. The built-in flash only goes about 10 feet. The external flash can go up to 30 feet and be used in creative ways.

I highly recommend the new Canon SD880IS. It is an outstanding compact camera. If your current compact digital camera is 2 years plus old you will find this a very worthwhile upgrade.</Content>

<Content>Im a retired photographer with more cameras than I thought I would ever need, but I always wanted a small camera for traveling. Its hard to drag along a D2x everywhere I go. Though this is not a D2x, for my needs it more than does the job. Sharpness is super for close up shots of people, or objects. Outdoors it also shines with great resolution, and contrast. It can be a simple as turning it on and shooting, or many menu options to cover most situations. 

I have had two Kodak cameras, and this one blows them out of the water. My wife grabbed my 14 megapixel Kodak for herself. So I bought this camera after seeing how my daughters Canon 890IS worked. Im very demanding when it comes to sharp pictures. This does the job, and is very small with lots of goodies to play with.

<Content>Pretty good camera. Ive used Canons for awhile and this one is definitely an upgrade. Still wish I could capture pictures easier without flash. Without flash you need ample light to capture a picture plus if the object is moving you need flash to ensure no blur. But you cant ask for too much with a Point and shoot. Pretty much better than any other brand for point  shoots though.</Content>

<Content>After some consideration of other options I settled on this camera as a christmas gift for my girlfriend.  It has only been two days since she opened it but, I can tell I made a wise purchase.  This product is loaded with great features but, for her, the ability to shoot in black and white seems to be her favorite.  I would really recommend this camera to anyone who has owned a Canon in the past-as the buttons are basically the same. 

Also...When I bought this product it was priced competetively; compared to other online vendors.  I think it was available at a price about $50 less than the leading electronics stores. 

I saved fifty bucks and I got a huge hug and a kiss...good deal :)

<Content>There are many reviews for this product with lots of helpful information so I almost didnt write one, but I did want to address a few points.  I purchased this camera because of all of the favorable Amazon reviews and am very happy with it.  The New York Times rated this the #1 camera in 2008 and I can see why.  Lot of features, easy to use, and great quality pictures.  

Here are a few of the things I was concerned about before purchasing this...hope this helps you:

1.  Shutter lag?  Nope, virtually none - the second I press the button it grabs the shot.   And thats with an old SD card.   I imagine the new SDHC card I ordered will be even faster, if that is possible.

2.  Gold vs silver?  I wanted to purchase this from Amazon so got the gold color.  Its a very subtle gold and could easily be mistaken for silver.  I was worried it might be too gold and flashy.  The color is more of a champagne color.  

3.  Easy to use?  Yes, only a couple of buttons on the back, and the auto mode is really all you need to get great pictures.

4. What type of media card?  It takes SD or SDHC, both of which are great formats as they are cheap and universal.  Thats why I dont buy Sony products as they use a proprietary technology.

5.  Easy to slip in my pocket? Yes, slips in my front jeans pocket easily, good size and light weight.

6.  Battery charge?  Lasts a good long time - unlike my last camera that had to be recharged at the end of every day.

I highly recommend this camera!  Hope you find these additional comments helpful - lots of good info in the other reviews.</Content>

<Content>a href=http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WHAWJSMHNV4Watch Video Here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WHAWJSMHNV4/a Canon PowerShot SD880IS

I have been using the SD880IS for the past 2 months and am extremely please with this little camera.

I purchase the camera as a replacement to my aging second still / main video camera the Fujifilm Z1.

My main camera is a Canon Xti but because of it size is not a good day to day, carry everywhere camera.

The SD880IS is has a very fast start up time (it has not being an issue in any of the shooting situations I have encounter)

The controls are very intuitive.  They maid the two most used controls (at least they have become that for me) the ISO selector and exposure compensation easily accessible.

Both functions are just one click away.

The camera takes excellent pictures at ISO 80 and 100 and good pictures at ISO 200 and 400.  The Pictures at ISO 800 and 1600 have been the best I have seen in non SLR cameras (Decent and very usable).

The click wheel controller is easy to get use to and a very efficient way of getting to the different camera functions.

Having a wide angle lens makes the biggest different on this camera that make is superior to the other higher pixel count pocket cameras canon.  Image stabilization is great.  It let me shoot sharp pictures at shutter speeds as low as 1/30 sec.  The other reason I have pocket camera is to use it as a video recorder and this camera makes an excellent job even in low light situations (a lot better than my old Z1).

Both David Poug from the New York Times and DPreview.com tested this camera with the other on this category for this year and it was picked #1 by David and #2 by DPreview.  I definitely recommend it as your next pocket camera.

<Content>I had a 5MP Canon camera for a few years and was quite happy with it.  Unfortunately, it broke and I purchased the 880IS to replace it.  

I have had significant issues with this 880 model and its ability to take non-blurry pictures, which is odd because it has image stabilization.  I did not have this problem with the 5MP model, except in low light conditions.  I cannot figure it out.  At least two-thirds of the pictures I take now are blurry.

Either theres something wrong with my camera or this model really is not very good.</Content>

<Content>I have bought cannon powershots for years and they have always taken video in .AVI format.  BEWARE This camera model does not. 

For some unknown reason this 880IS camera takes video in .MOV format which most of my software does not recognize. 

I was not aware and did not discover this until I tried to play my video in my progams. I got errors that told me to download .MOV drivers. ( this is not easy as they are not consistant and I stil cannot look at my videos on my favorite platform.  

I have had the camera for 3 months. I would have bought another cannon powershot model if I had known this. (CANNON DOES MAKE GREAT CAMERAS)</Content>

<Content>I was very disappointed in the photo quality of this camera.  I previously owned the SD850, which I loved and it took wonderful clear photos, even indoors.  Sadly, I dropped it and broke the lens and decided to just order a new camera.  I love the idea of the wider lens, but every picture I took with the SD880 came out blurry.  It looked great on the LCD, but one uploaded to computer, every photo was grainy and spotty.  I am returning this camera and ordering the SD870 for almost the same price.  </Content>

<Content>Im certainly not an expert in selecting the best point and shoot cameras; however, I did do a lot of research (i.e. talking to experts, reading reviews, in-store testing, etc.) to determine which features I couldnt live without and decide which camera met each of my requirements. I had a Canon PS already so I was already a big fan but Ive got to say out of all the Canons I looked at this one really impressed me. It exceeds all my expectations as a mom who is really just looking for a good camera to get great shots of my family. I dont do any fancy tricks (yet) but now I have endless possibilities to have fun with my photography. You can learn all the technical details from the other posted reviews and the manufacturer information. I just wanted to express how easy this product is to use and how wonderful the quality is for what I consider an upgrade to our previous camera. Ive already enjoyed the new features in my first week of ownership. I highly recommend.</Content>

<Content>i got this camera cause i thought it was a sweet deal (best price ive seen AND it came with a free 4gb sdhc card), so, what the heck, i bought it!  for what it is, its okay. ive owned 4 canon digital cameras. this is the latest one. the functions i wanna get to-- take a lot moe steps and manuvering through the menu; which i dont have time for when it comes to time sensative shots. this lessens its funtionality and is why im not so happy with giving it the full 5 stars.

for example, when im drunk, and i dont want a color shot with flash (as to not show my drunken redness!!) with previous models, all i had to do was switch the picture set mode to manual by moving it to the left (and i conveniently had manual set to black and white) with flash, and within 2 seconds i can have a fabulous picture. now it takes 5 times as long and a lot of button pushing to get the camera to shoot to black in white in a flash.

other than that, it does the job.</Content>

Its a mid range powershot, I expected the build quality to be a little nicer than it was, but its not bad for the $250 price they are going for. The high end powershots feel nicer to use like the SD950 and G10.  The camera is speedy in operation and has a very nice screen.

<Content>I just bought this camera for my wife as an early Christmas gift, as our Sony DSC-W1 we bought in 2004 was starting to die.  I read all the reviews on Amazon.com, Digital Photography Review, and Ken Rockwell.  I finally decided that the SD880IS had the features that we wanted.  

Well, after a week of using the camera, I am very pleased with the camera.  The 3.0 LCD is very sharp, and the colors are very true to life.  My wife took a picture of an amazing sunset with red, purple, and orange hues.  After taking the picture, she compared it to the actual sunset and the colors were identical.  The Image Stabilization (IS) also works very well.

The automatic settings are great for general use, and you have some manual control on some settings.  One of the bells and whistles that we like is the ability to shoot black and white except for one color.

Some people have complained of the noise at the higher ISO settings.  Yes, there is some noise visible.  Considering everything that this camera does, and how well it does it, a little noise is not that big of a deal.  If you want reduced noise, dont buy a point and shoot but a DSLR instead.

I also bought my wife the Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6.  I cant even fathom filling it up.  We can take up to 189 minutes of video and several thousand pictures at the highest resolution.</Content>

I mean I thoroughly researched it making sure I was getting my moneys worth and today I can definitely say....I made the best choice in going with the Canon SD880. My husband was very impressed with the quality of pictures and video.  The pictures are clean and very clear especially the ones of our lovely beaches. I have even persuaded my sister to get herself one.  

The Canon came highly recommended by a friend at work and I am glad I made this choice.  Amazon was timely in delivering this product even the day before I was about to travel back home to Barbados.

<Content>I just got this camera and have been playing around with it for about a week.  I formerly had an Olympus and loved it, but everyone who I knew who had a Powershot loved them, so I thought Ids give it a shot. 
The LCD is crystal clear and I like the dial.  It is fairly easy to get the hang of.  I do recommend reading the manual, though because there are a lot of things this camera can do...I have a tendency of putting my camera in Auto and leaving it there, so please read the book!  I love the Color Accent feature where you can single out one color in the frame and make the rest of the shot black and white.  I like that you can shoot in black and white and also sepia, or focus on a color and make it vivid.
I havent gotten the hang of the other features, for example foliage.  The pictures always seems to come up blurry for me when I shoot in the different modes.  I dont know if I am doing something wrong, but I have read the manual and have followed the instructions with these specific features and if you dont hold your hand COMPLETELY still youll get a blurry shot...you get a better shot if you just shoot in AUTO.
I will continue to play around with all the features and try and master them, but in the meantime I really like this camera and would recommend it to anyone that asks.

<Content>Let me start by saying that Im not a camera guy - being a great photographer would be really cool, but thats not me.  I take pictures because I want to see the things in my life, not to create art.  I like to have some control over a few features (a mode setting, shutter speed, flash, zoom) but Im pretty much a pick-it-up, point and shoot guy.  I actually read the manual for this camera (front to back!) and I owned an earlier model Canon PowerShot from a couple years ago.  All that goes to say that your experience with this camera might be different than mine if youre different than me, if you know more about cameras or if you have the time to research the issues (I note that many of the very favorable reviews of this camera come from people who seem to know a lot about cameras).

My main beef with this camera is that the pictures are very fuzzy and blurry.  Ive tried all the pre-set modes (it has a bunch, many more than my old Canon - Fireworks setting, Aquarium setting, Snow setting...) and they all seem to involve fairly long shutter times, so the pictures tend to range from slightly blurry or hazy to downright fuzzy - if the subject moves at all, or if you are not completely steady, the picture is compromised, regardless of the mode you use.  This problem is much worse if you turn off the flash, which I do quite a bit because the camera autoflashes even if the lighting is ok but not great and, if youre within 5 or 6 feet of the subject, the flash will completely bleach out the picture (faces are just bright white blobs).  The camera seems to automatically slow down the shutter speed even more without the flash on, so the problem of blur becomes worse.  I think this would proably be ok if you tend to take staged pictures of things that dont move much (adults, landscapes, etc) from places where you can have a good steady hand and time to concentrate on being still, but I take pictures of my kids, and I usually only have a split second to catch them and no time to concentrate on steadying the camera.  This camera is just not good at that.

For the non-photographer, the manual setting menus are virtually incomprehensible - I tried to use them to get past this problem and havent figured them out at all.  

I give this camera 3 stars because I assume there must be a way to solve this problem if I just knew more about the camera or spent more time researching it.  My wife, whos about the same level of sophistication as me with cameras, detests this camera and is about to buy a different camera even though weve only had this one for a month and a half.  All in all, I would not buy this camera again - Im sure its great for some things, but it just wasnt meant for someone like me.  

UPDATE:  I recently tried to print pictures from this camera of my new daughter, between month 2 and 5.  It turns out that the camera has a setting that takes ultra low resolution, thumbnail pictures (like 70kb images).  Our camera had inadvertently been put on this setting, and I couldnt print any of the pictures, even on basic 4x6 pictures - the resolution was too low.  I suppose that we, at some point, inadvertently changed this setting, though my wife and I dont remember doing it and certainly didnt know what we had done.  My point isnt that this setting is inherently bad - with as cheap as memory is, I personally would never use a setting where I knew in advance that the pictures, no matter how good, could never be used for anything other than putting on Facebook, but I suppose some people might.  My point is that a camera designed for ordinary users should not allow you to change to this setting without making sure you wanted to do it and understood what you were doing - it should have warnings that clearly spell out that you wont be able to print the pictures.  

As I mentioned before, I think this camera is good for a camera person, the people who like to spend a couple of quiet evenings bonding with their camera, studying the manual, taking a bunch of practice pictures, experimenting and unlocking its mysteries and idiosyncracies.  But if you want to take it out of the box, charge the battery, spend 10 minutes on the manual and then take good pictures without issue for the next 2 years, then Id definitely recommend against buying this camera. </Content>

<Content>Ive had the SD870IS for over a year now and I can tell you that its the best Powershot camera Canon has ever produced. Something went terribly wrong with the SD880IS camera Canon recently came out with and this is why you should look towards getting the SD870IS over the SD880IS. You can see the real difference when taking picture in doors. With the SD880IS, all pictures seem to come out grainy and washed out. I thought I had a bad camera, so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement took even worse pictures, so I returned that one as well. I think Canon cheaped out when producing this new model in trying to sell mass quantities for a lesser price. Shame on Canon for putting out such rubbish! If you want the real deal and the best Powershop Canon on the market, get the SD870IS and you will never look at any of the other models ever again. Just look at all the positive reviews for the SD870IS and you will understand what I mean. As for the SD880IS, all I can say is Get Outta Here!</Content>

<Content>I am photographer with years of experience and have used over two dozen digital cameras (from DSLRs to point-and-shoots).  This is a fine camera, except that it suffers from excessive noise (even at 80 and 100 ISO) for it to be fully useful.  The 10MP is of limited value, as most of the pixels are smeared by the aggressive noise reduction.  Bumping down to lower MP levels does not alleviate the problem.  Could be a good camera to use in full sunlight or outdoor shots, but not for anything indoors.  While one cant expect any point-and-shoot to have the sensitivity of a DSLR, my old Canon SD1000 pocket cam performs better than the SD880 in this regard. </Content>

<Content>I got this for my wife who likes to take photos occasionally but doesnt want to fuss much.

This camera can take really decent photos.  Like all PS, its Achilles heel is flash photography.  The flash is good but you can tell it was used (vs say using a nice flash attachment and bouncing or diffusing it).
But I set it so that in the P setting, it is 400 ISO with no flash. Consequently all my wife has to do is switch to P mode with her finger and she can take the same indoors shot with no flash.  With the image stabilization and 28mm setting, that about does it  great indoor shots during the day or evening with no flash. 

This has a great macro setting in its pre-set scenes that you can easily cycle thru with its iPod-like dial.  You can get about 2 away (flash is off or at least doesnt seem to fire).

The color saturation is nice as is the auto-color balance.  The auto face-detection is funny to see kick in - even if you are taking a photo of a photo, you will see little boxes form around the faces in the LCD.

The wide LCD and 28mm really are good features.  It turns on fast, you can set it to take multiple exposures (but I think that will turn off the flash).

You can set a lot on it manually - three things you cannot do are: manually set the focus or speed (most PS users never would anyway) and adjust the flash with a flash exp compensation.  It has a number of really nice scenic settings - from taking aquarium photos to snow scenes to an ISO3200 for really dark stuff - although it is very grainy. Of course it does video too.  

The product shipped fine from Amazon.  Has nice review features - easy to delete photos when you want.</Content>

<Content>Received 1st SD880, there was a distinct clicking sound when zooming in/out. Called Amazon, they sent a replacement right away. Good to know theres still great customer service in America. Also own SD870 (wife took it one day, havent seen it since...), lens corners and barrel distortion definitely better than SD870. Digic4 fast, lots of cool new features. Video considerably better, files more compact (still cannot zoom optically but that would be a lot to ask for). 

As far as all important Image Quality, I cant tell the difference between the two (dont get caught up in the MP hype, above 5-6MPSs, for most people who dont crop a lot, its all marketing). Overall a great compact p/s with 28mm wide capability.</Content>

<Content>Canon PowerShot SD880IS 10MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver) This camera replaces my trusty SD700IS which met its demise from a nasty drop in Europe during summer holiday. The LCD screen size of the SD880 is great and makes for easy preview and post viewing of your photos. Image quality is good if you wait a moment for the focus. The face recognition system in the camera works very well and helps make for better sharpness then past cameras when focusing on people.  Its fun to watch it find the faces and go to work. I do wish Canon worked in a standard viewfinder to save the battery but I guess that would have made the size of the LCD smaller to accommodate it.

I would suggest you have enough light or you will find a little higher noise in your photos. This is the downside of having 10 mega pixels. 

There are limited manual controls on this camera which is typical of newer point and shoots but if you do some reading or have a geek friend you can figure out how to force the flash for fill flash, take decent night photos and do some panoramas.

I do have one small nit about wrist strap that came with the camera, it is the first one I have EVER got that was not adjustable to hold the camera firmly on my wrist. I ended up using the old one off my broken SD700.

I can recommend a nice case for this camera, the Tamrac 5204.</Content>

<Content>I was very disappointed with this camera.  In general, Canon carries a good reputation with its name and I always respected their products, but this product is very poor.  My friends have Canons, an old camera that Im replacing is a Canon, which I was really happy with.  Initially, when I received this camera I was actually impressed by all the functionality and features.  However, as I started taking pictures in different settings I realized that the image quality is terrible.  Pictures look very grainy and pixilated.  I wasnt impressing with shutter speed either.  Im looking for a camera that takes picture a little quicker in Auto mode.  Im returning this camera mainly because of the image quality and going to keep shopping around for something better.</Content>

<Content>I love this camera.  I use it for taking short films of my sons fencing matches.  The camera records video in mpg format so most video editing software works well with the the camera.

The battery life is great I have never had it fail me during use.  I do carry a spare but have yet to need it.  

A 4 Gig memory chip will hold about 5 minutes worth of video or Heaven knows how many pictures.

The panorama feature is fun.  You take a picture and it highlights the right hand edge.  line it up with the next picture you want to take in the series and click away.  Ive done 180 degrees but might try 360 just for fun.

If I had to come up with a defect it would be the rounded edges of the camera.  It is designed to stand on the right end, but it is less than stable.  I keep it in the case because the only way to put it down would be on its back, screen side down, begging for a scratch -  or worse.</Content>

The in house red eye reduction software is a pleasure to work with and saves me time when I am touching up photos.  This camera shoots great out door shots and does very well indoors as well, but be aware it does have some issues with a pretty bright flash which can lead to lighting up dust spots in the air which can cause problems. My older 800 series camera was really bad, Canon seems like they improved this but it is still an issue. What they need is a flash intensity setting, which would help.  Over all the camera takes great pictures and it takes them fast, so if you have little kids you wont loose those shots when they decide to move. :) I would have given it a 5 if it wasnt for the occasional shot muffed up by the dust orbs.... </Content>

<Content>I bought this for my wife as a Bday present to replace her tiny and always carried SD450 (5MB, no IS and 3 years old). The SD880 is a much better camera, costs less than the SD450 did in 2005 and is still tiny (fits in the same case). The improvements are many: ultra-sharp 28mm wide-angle lens with 4X zoom, 3 bright and clear LCD, both optical image stabilization (IS) and a new low-noise (for its size) 10MP sensor. 

A few reviews here report crappy images and/or high noise levels but those are not my findings, at least not relative to other point and shoot cameras. I tested the SD880 against: her Canon SD450 (5MP), my Fuji F31fd (6MP) and a borrowed Panasonic LX-3 (10MP). 

SD880 images are sharper than any of the three other cameras at the same f-stops and focal lengths.  This is especially true regarding the SD450.   Given the Leica pedigree on the LX-3s super fast (f2.0-2.8) 24-60mm lens I had expected it to be sharper than the tiny SD880 so was surprised to find noticeably sharper images with the SD880 even near the edges of the frame.   Although the Fuji is just 6MP, it is closest in sharpness to the SD880, but only in good light at lower ISO.  

The SD880 produces lower image noise at high ISOs (400 and up) than both the SD450 and the LX-3.  Beating the LX-3 in this test at ISO 400, 800 and 1600 was also surprising given the LX-3s slightly larger sensor size. The Fuji has the lowest noise level at high ISO BUT images become overly smoothed with less sharpness than either the SD880 or the LX-3.  The SD880 retains more sharpness than the Fuji as ISO is cranked up to 800 and 1600, but did have more noise. ISO 400 noise is low with the SD880 and images are usable at ISO 800. ISO 1600 should be reserved for low-light emergencies where flash is verboten and if prints are kept 6 x 4 or smaller. 

Another low-light advantage of the SD880 (at least for nearly stationary scenes) is the optical IS. This really works and allows lower ISO values to be used with longer shutter speeds. My wife often blurred shots on the SD450 due to camera motion. The IS has helped a lot to reduce this. 

UPDATE: The optics on my wifes SD880 are so sharp that I decided to get one too.  My copy produces softer photos, not really fuzzy and about as sharp as the 6MP Fuji but without the super crispness of the first SD880. I can clearly see the difference.  My revised conclusion is that it is possible, but not certain, to get a Canon 880IS with exceptionally sharp optics.  For that reason I would downgrade my rating to 4 stars if Amazon would permit (they dont).  Good luck.</Content>

<Content>This is my first Canon product, i have always had Nikons. Although I am still learning it I am very pleased. I bought a Nikon 710 first and did not like the results and returned it and decided to try the Canon and I have been very happy with it so far. In my opinion I get a little better color out of it than my previous coolpix cameras and i like the delayed shutter for night time photos with low ISO. </Content>

<Content>Okay, i hate giving bad reviews. But i had a horrible experience with this camera. I bought sd880 for $259 in circuit city. Brought it home and took some pics indoors and outdoors. Camera is easy to use. Wheel is very nice touch. But when i downloaded into computer and looked at full sized pics. There was a LOT of noise. I didnt expect this quality from canon. Everything seemed outta focus too.
Then i started reading reviews, and i found this to be known issue for this camera. I mean its a deal breaker. If picture quality is bad what good will 3 inch LCD, 4x zoom and wide angle lens do? I tried to decreasing the mega pixels and problem didnt get resolved. I also changed settings and tried every which way. LOTS of noise. grainy picture. 
i couldnt believe that. I thought i got faulty camera. I did an exchange on circuit city. And that new camera had same problem. I gave up today and returned for 15% re-stocking fee.. What a disappointment. Clearly stay away from this camera UNLESS u dont mind grainy pics.. looks horrible. </Content>

<Content>  Canon SD models have a very high quality photo for the amount you pay for them. I have had two models before this one and have had no problems with either,the SD 800 IS and the SD 850 IS. I expect the same from this model. So far I am impressed by the photos I have  very good results. I like to carry the model SD 880 with me most of the time for unexpected shots. I carry my 50D or D300 for the expected shots, The SD880 so far has met my expectations and will be in my car most of the time.
 I highly recommend  the 880 to beginners or anyone else. </Content>

<Content>My dissatisfaction with the Canon SD880IS all stem from really missing my old Fujifilm F30.  That good old camera has the best lens/CCD of any point-n-shoot that Ive ever seen.  Even ISO1600 photos were usable.  Everything was low noise.  But (probably because its Made in Ch---) the two F30s that Ive owned all crashed way before reaching 2 full years of use.  Yes, I had liked the camera so much that after the first one died I bought another one to replace it.

Yes, the problem with the SD880 is NOISE NOISE NOISE.  Even at very low ISO I can see the noise everywhere on the picture.  I tried going for lower pixel count but they are still very visible.  If you want to buy this camera, make sure that youve taken a few photos and zoom them out in playback mode.  Its only after feeding a photo through Noise Ninja that I finally breathed a sigh of relief.  

Noise problem aside, the SD880 is packed with so many neat features.  Ive set the manual white balance to be trigged by the printer button. All I have to do is to point the camera at the white ceiling, press the printer button, and the camera is white-balanced exactly for that specific lighting.  

Face detection works great, and I really like the TV - self-timer - Face detection combo:  I hook the camera to the TV, put the self-timer on Face detection mode, press the shutter, and nonchalantly walk to the spot of my choice before turning to face the camera.  The camera reads my face and multiple shots of me are made.  

This camera takes BEAUTIFUL indoor photos -- with a flash, that is.  (The Fuji F30 had been able to take all sorts of great indoor photos without flash.)  The Canon engineers have done a great job with post-processing to get such nice even lighting on indoor photos, especially with such a tiny flash.

I take photos with i-Contrast off.  In the playback mode, I can apply the i-Contrast as I choose.  And speaking of i-Contrast, I find that the SD880 tries too hard to second guess what photos I want, and the photos tend to turn out a bit flat.  The photos all improve tremendously when I use Picasa or Photoshop to deepen the shadows.  This is especially true with indoor photos.

The video mode is not so useful.  There is no optical zoom with video.  The camera fakes a video zoom by doing a digital zoom.  Of course, if the video is already only 640x480, doing a digital zoom will get you horrendous resolution.  So just pretend that there is no video zoom.  The microphone on the camera is bad.

The handling of the camera is very good, and it is a beautiful looking gem.  And I hope that its being Made in Japan will at least buy me more years than my two terrific but unfaithful Fuji F30s.  Now if Canon were to come up with a 28mm F2.8 camera that had the same CCD-sensor philosophy and the manual controls as the F30 (fewer Megapixels for superb noise control), I would really PAY for that camera, bad economy or no.

[Correction to my original review]

I gave up on this camera.  I had written that indoor photography with flash was very nice.  I WAS WRONG.  The flash is simply too weak.  If the subject is perfectly still, yes, indoor shots with flash is lovely.  But last week I photographed some kids at a Thanksgiving dinner party.  They werent even moving that much, but the flash could not freeze their motion.  In a normally lit room, with the camera set at hi-ISO (ISO 250) the shutter speed was 1/10 sec with flash.  Subject blur occurred.  I have never encountered such problem with any of the myriads of point-n-shoot that Ive owned in the last 25 years.  

The camera is truly beautiful to behold.  But at the end of the day, its decent photos that I want.  The lens is too small, pixel density on the CCD is too high, and the flash too weak.  No fancy bells and whistles on the electronics can overcome these physical limitations.</Content>

<Content>My brother has a slightly older Canon model (less MP), but also with wide angle lens and he loves it.  And I love this one.  My mom just bought one as well as the price dropped from $288- for the Gold colored one to $255- for the silver one (whats up with the color vs. pricing scheme?!?).  Incredibly easy to use, does the thinking for you, yet has easy to access features to ensure high quality shots for indoor, outdoor, beach, etc.  

And plenty of options such as color-swap, etc. in case you want to play (or more likely your kids or nieces/nephews who inherently figure out these odd features you didnt know about even though you read the friggin manual!).

Also bought the leather case from Canon for $16.95 or so and its a perfect fit and well worth the money (comes with an extra leather wrist strap as well).

Go easy on anything above a 2 MB SD card as your computer will always need to read all those pictures before uploading to your computer which makes for downtime.

Only downside on this camera was via Amazon which initially promised a free 4 MB SD card but gave no instructions on how to order/get, so I had to make some phone calls/emails to resolve.  In true customer-service care, Amazon has already updated their web-site so it should be a flawless shopping experience for those of you going down this purchase route.  

Oh yeah, I did get a 2nd battery, but from another site as it was cheaper than Amazon.  Ironically, the link to this site was via Amazon (the same page as this SD880IS camera).  Guess Amazon gets a fee for linking them.

Enjoy this camera, I am!</Content>

<Content>Ive always come back to Canon cameras. Usually they are fantastic point and shoot cameras. This one however is the first Ive had a problem with. I got maybe 2 images out of 75 on the first night I used it that were not blurry. Usually the persons face came out somewhat clear but the neck down or above the head was  and blurry. I tried it on auto and also changed the setting to the perfect scene, such as night shot or action shot or indoors. They all came out just as blurry and distorted as the last. Im hoping I somehow got a defective one and Im going to send it back to Amazon.com and hope they do not give me the run around. Good luck with yours! I may go down to the sd870, a friend has one and it seems to work beautifully.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera after trying out 2 other cameras. I liked features on all three of them and wish that I could get all the excellent features in ONE camera. One of my top choosing points is that it has to be fast! I have 2 toddlers and I was missing all the great shots because of my old camera (Olympus)So I went to bust buy and puchased a Nikon coolpix 660. Features that I liked...continous shooting mode. I could take 5 or more pics to capture a neat action such as your child jumping up and down or spinning. Smile detection was a nice feature but wasnt fast enough. Then I tried the fugifilm finepix (i cant remember which model) great zoom, but blurry pictures and this camera took atleast 4 seconds from the time I pushed the button until it actually took the picture (in low to mid lighting) So, it was out! A professional photographer recommended the Canon ELPH for a point and shoot camera. So, I bought this one. So far so good. Fast, good quality pictures, rare blurry pictures, wide angle zoom is nice, a few features I wish it had...is the continous shooting, a bigger zoom. And one nuissance, is that could be just my lack of experience with the camera but when I view pictures it never fills up the entire space of the lcd. All in all, I think this one is a keeper. </Content>

<Content>Before owning the SD880 (which Ive had the pleasure of testing all day, by the way), Ive been an owner of the ever-popular SD1000.

The reason I needed a new camera was because I lost my SD1000 drunk at a party (lol). So after looking this up online, I was like, WOW COOL GLOWING REVIEWS YAYYYY -- but I guess because this camera is so new, there arent enough REAL reviews from users who have had a bad experience with this.

Let me tell you this.
The SD1000 delivers crisp, gorgeous images, while the SD880 is SPATTERED with noise and pixels! Its embarassing! I really dont like this camera. I feel like I couldve just bought a crappy little fujifilm finepix z100 and had to suffer through the same thing (which I already have, by the way, and that camera SUCKS OMG. The noise is even WORSE on that LOL)!!

I lose a LOT of cameras partying. Haha

10mp on the SD880 vs 7.1 on the SD1000 does not always equal a BETTER camera. In fact, increasing the MP actually INVITES more noise into your pictures, giving it a grainy, rough feel instead of a smooth, pretty image!

I really feel like Ive wasted my money. I should have just gone with the SD1100 or the SD1000. *SIGH*

Probably the only thing nice about this camera is the CONTINUOUS focus. Meaning, when you hold down the shutter button halfway, you can still move the camera around and it will continue to adjust its focus for the movement and different objects entering the image. Also, the LCD screen is MUCH larger.

But why does that even MATTER when youre just going to load these up on your computer anyway?? And you can basically just zoom in and blah-blah-blah.

Plus, this camera is MUCH fatter than the SD1100 and SD1000.

ANOTHER downside to this camera is the position of the microphone!
WTF?!

Which genius decided to have the microphone directly under your finger when youre hitting the shutter button!? It produces crappy scratchy noises and makes it incredibly inconvenient to shoot. I can just IMAGINE handing this camera to one of my friends during a party without them knowing about this, and having them screw up the ENTIRE movie because of the location of the microphone! GUH!!

Overall, not a fan.
I will be returning this bright and early tomorrow.</Content>

<Content>This is a great point-and-shoot product (and yes I own one and am happy).  Please, allow me to speak up the cons only, since there is already enough praise for it.

It is slightly overpriced for a plastic body camera, but adds value with its style. ..and the brand. And it is only one with wide angle lens in its class made by Canon. So not much choice left to opt out.  But here are the cons:

In compression with the older models (e.g. with less mega pixels from this product line) the pictures lack sharpness.  This is due to noise reduction processing, and is especially evident at ISO speed of 400 and up.  In fact my personal testing with a European IXUS 80 (8 mega pixels model or even ancient IXUS 50), shows that IXUS 80 has better sharpness, which allows for greater detail, and even in spite of greater noise (grain).  So my personal opinion - SD880 has too much noise reduction that drives the detail out making 8 mega pixels pictures taken with older canon cameras look better. Less noise - less detail - more mega pixels is a waste.

The camera also lacks some controls that older canon power shoot models had. For example - manual setting, a must for an enthusiast like me.  (I own an old good Nikon D70 dSLR, but back up my life with this compact companion. So I want more controls over the shooting process, that many other point-and-shoot offer.)

Oh, yes, one thing - the videos shoot with this one ARE GREAT. And it takes one second to switch into video mode with print button.</Content>

<Content>I just received this camera four days ago. Ive taken indoor night photos and outdoor day photos.

Four Pros

The camera is quick, and I can whip it out and take a photo without missing a shot

This camera takes really amazing photos at 6 mp (more of that below). And the outdoor photos are amazingly crisp.

Night shots are for the most part correctly exposed (not too dark)

The scene modes are really fun like photo stitch, color accent, and indoor mode. 


An idea I had

On Mega Pixels
Like many people have been saying 10 mega pixels is a lot of mp for the size of the CCD, so what I decided to do is lower the resolution to 6mp (and put the quality to superfine) to improve photo quality. I think that the quality of the photos I have taken in this fashion look good up to ISO 400. Photos still print very well at 4x7 and well at 8x10 just an idea you might want to play with. Its nice however to have 10 mp, if I wanted to make a poster.

Two Cons

On Flash
This camera produces flash spots (I dont know the technical term for this). A flash spot is a small circular white dot in the photo that is not in the original scene. Its caused by the placement of the flash in comparison to the lens. One way to try and get around this is simply take two photos of the same scene and hope one does not have a flash bunny. Supposedly this is a common issue with compacts.  This is the main reason I am giving this camera 4 stars instead of 5.

On manual settings
You cannot set the shutter speed nor f stop. The only reason this is annoying is because when I take indoor photos at night the camera automatically sets itself to 1/60 shutter speed. Which might be a problem for dancing shots or photos of my friends that really talk with their hands. However, as of yet all the night shots have been clear and correctly exposed.

<Content>I was previously a big fan of the Casio digital cameras, but after having to replace two due to the battery compartment loosening over time, I decided to try a different brand, and Im glad I stumbled across the camera.

There are a lot of improvements with this camera over ones Ive previously used, but the primary reason for purchasing this camera was the wide angle lens. Most of our family photos are vacations pictures from theme parks and beaches, so this worked out perfectly. I always hated having the important landmarks cut out of the pictures in the past. 

The other reason I chose this camera was due to the large LCD screen. My son has a Vivitar with a 3 inch screen, and I really fell in love with being able to instantly see much more detail of the snapshot without having to zoom in to check details. 

The contrast on the pictures seems spot on, but most of our pictures are taken during the day, so I cant comment on the contrast capabilities in the evening or night. 

Other than that, the camera has all the bells and whistles that were on my Casio. It has various scene settings such as low light, underwater, aquarium, fireworks, indoors, sunset, foliage, snowscape, beach, pets, kids, nightscape, and portrait. This is nice because I have no idea how to set up a point and shoot to take good fireworks or sunset pictures. 

This camera also works excellent as a small video camera picking up voice as well as video. I also like the fact that this camera comes with a rechargeable battery and a small SD card. Youll probably want to upgrade the SD card right away though since it doesnt hold many pictures. 

If you plan to use the camera underwater, I was also thrilled to know that they sell an underwater case. That will come in very useful when we go to Key West and the good news is that Amazon sells it: Canon WP-DC26 Waterproof Case for Canon PowerShot SD880IS Digital Cameras.

To sum it up, I love this camera because of the wide angle lens, the large glare resistant LCD screen, the rechargeable battery pack, and the ability to do underwater shots with the addition of the underwater case. I just hope the underwater case drops in a price a bit, since it seems to be overpriced at the present.

The shots turn out great, even motion shots, and I will be recommending this camera to everyone I know. </Content>

<Content>Last year, Canon SD870IS camera was a winner in the SD series and the SD880IS manages to offer even more at a lower starting price (than that of SD870IS last year). 

Whats NEW?

--New DIGIC 4 technology, up from DIGIC 3 which tries to improve the camera performance in low light and at higher ISO - is it successful? I noted a slight improvement in some shots.

- Updated face detection technology. It helps the camera create better contrast for faces and does not bleach out all color from the faces in a shot. The Face Detection Self Timer is new, so if you want to take a group shot including yourself all you have to do is focus the camera on the group and then walk into the group. The camera will detect a new face and click the shot.

- A BIGGER CCD - 1/2.3 up from the previous 1/2.5 in the SD870 which allows for increase in MPs to 10MP (up from 8MP of SD870)

- 4X Zoom (up from 3.8X on SD870) and a wide angle which really helps with shots at close quarters (in a car/bus, of a large group etc.)

- Motion Detection is also new. On this mode the camera allows you to focus on a moving object or person by pressing the shutter half-way and then click the shot even though the object/person continued to move across the frame. Earlier, you would have got a motion blur if you tried to take the same picture 

- The huge 3 inch LCD screen is the same as the SD870 but slightly improved technology gives you brighter playback in low-light which makes it easier to see the shots in replay. It does not have a viewfinder but I have never missed the viewfinder on my SD870 since Canon made the screen anti-glare. Id take a bigger screen any day over a 2.5 inch screen with a viewfinder, but if you like to use the viewfinder to compose your shots you might need to look at the SD990 IS and drop another 100 bucks.

- Updated Scene Modes. It gives you the standard Canon modes like before: Auto, Manual, Digital, Color Accent (you can pick a color to retain in the shot and the rest of the picture will be black and white), Color Swap (swap a color in the pic for another) and Stitch Assist (take a panoramic pic by stitching together many shots). 

The SD880 IS makes some additions to the special scene modes like Sunset and ISO 3200. The rest remain the same: Portrait, Foliage, Snow, Beach, Fireworks, Aquarium, Underwater, Indoor, Kids  Pets, Night Snapshot. I really like the special scene modes and use them extensively. According to Canon they are based on their library of shots and I agree that they really work very well to give me great pictures.

The other Canon features are the same as before on this camera. Some that I find useful are as follows:

-Image stabilization, this is particularly helpful at higher zoom
- Single Shot and Continuous mode
- Colors you can set in the manual mode -  Vivid, Vivid Blue, Vivid Green, Vivid Red, Neutral, Sepia, Black  White, Positive Film, Lighter Skin Tone, Darker Skin Tone, Custom color (RGB adjustment)
- Movie mode - regular and also slow synchro (allows you to create interesting videos by shooting at timed intervals)
- On camera editing and Pictbridge (print directly from camera)
- Red eye reduction - the face detection technology minimizes red eye more accurately than before. If you still get red eye, especially when youre shooting indoors, Ive found that this camera can take care of it automatically. You can select red eye correction option in the menu while in replay mode, the camera automatically searches for faces in the pic and removes the red eye and also allows you to do it manually if you want. 
- Connect to TV with included cord and run slideshow with transition effects of your choice to view pics. Very useful while on vacation or at a friends place.
- Allows you to erase pics by number of pics, or by date taken, or even by people vs. scenery/objects, a very useful feature in this age of high capacity cards
- You can record sound bites on pics to remember locations etc.

If you can take the time to read the manual, you will discover more features which allow for more creativity with this camera.

 Limitations:
- No viewfinder, I prefer the bigger screen but it may be critical for you
- Some chromatic aberration, common to most point and shoot cameras not just this Canon model
- If youre shooting at night in low light with full zoom the wide angle causes the camera to sometimes focus on the dust particles in between resulting in white orbs in the picture. Ive taken care of most issues by setting the focus correctly by half pressing the shutter and using night mode but some orbs still show up in some pics especially if there is moisture in the air and I am using the zoom. 

UPDATE 11/21/2008: Downgrading rating to 4 stars, this camera does have more noise than my earlier Canons. 

Summary
This camera is very well priced for the features it offers. If you are looking for a reasonably priced compact PS that is still pocketable but gives you superior shots and more flexibility in composing shots (read wide angle), look no further. If youre looking for a smaller camera than SD880 that gives you superior performance, I recommend the SD790 although it does not have wide angle.

<Content>I recently bought his camera, greatest digital camera ever!  It is a definitely a bit pricy, but for what you get, it is worth it.  It is the NEWEST of the digital elph line along with the 990is.  I would have gotten the 990is, but it was more than I could afford, but the black is awesome.  What I like about this so far..

1. great photos
2. fast
3. auto AND manual capability
4. its a sturdy and beautiful piece of art
5. there are so many options...  you can change the correct the photos with this thing
6. great nighttime photos but you have to increase the exposure manually

dislikes
1.  the wrist cord thing is not adjustable, so you might drop the camera easy (easy to change, so no big problem)
2. mine came with one dead pixel on the lcd screen (i got it through ebay, so maybe the person selling knew it.  this isnt a big deal though because it doesnt affect the pictures.  canon actually guarantees that 99.99% of the pixels arent dead.  (this dead pixel problem is common in other cameras too with lcds or any lcd screen for that matter)

LOVE IT SO FAR.  TOTALLY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ONE FOR ANYONE.  ITS THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK.</Content>

<Content>This camera rocks, but it does fall short for the title Perfect Camera.  It has all the bells and whistles you expect from a compact digital camera.  This new one even has this great timer function with face detection.  Whats so great about it is that it will start the countdown after it detects a new face in the camera.  The wide angle lens is great for group shots, portraits, and the usual stuff with scenery and people.  Yet, it only has a 4X optical zoom.  This is not enough if you have a wide angle lens.  In comparison, a camera with a 36mm equivalent will have a longer zoom even with a 3.7X optical zoom, such as the new SD990IS. Canon Powershot SD990IS 14.7MP Digital Camera with 3.7x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)  Yet, it is good enough for everyday and for that special trip to Rome.  But, forget about zooming in on that statue a few blocks away as it will not reach.

Although this camera has tons of features, it does not have enough manual functions for the enthusiasts.  The new SD990IS has new manual functions to play with aperture, shutter speed, manual focus, and all the good stuff.  I am guessing Canon will not add these manual settings in to the 800 line until later next year.  This is too bad as the functions would make pictures come out even better with the ability to adjust settings to perfection.  

All in all, this camera is great and would be a good replacement for any older 800 series such as the SD850 or SD870.  I highly recommend it as long as you dont need any manual settings.  The auto focus, DIGIC 4 processor, and the iSAPS will give you enough automatic settings adjustment to take quality pictures in a blink of an eye.

PROS:
10MP
3 LCD
DIGIC 4
28mm equivalent wide angle lens
more functions than SD870

CONS:
Only 4X optical zoom (typical for compacts)
Skimpy manual settings (typical for compacts)
Ugly 3 position slide switch on top of camera (why?)

<Content>This camera hits all of the sweet spots for those wanting a powerful, small point and shoot camera with excellent speed and picture quality.  What sets it apart from other cameras in this category is the wide angle lens.  You can fit more into the picture especially group shots and landscapes.  Also, because of the wide lens, you can zoom in on your shots without cutting off objects or people on the edges.  Most other ultra compact cameras do not have this feature.  I have used Canons other wide angle compact - the SD870IS and loved it.  This newer model adds many upgrades to that model: 10 megapixels, fast and powerful Digic 4 processor, motion detection, 4x optical zoom, intelligent contrast, self timer with face detection, and a smaller size for pocketability.  Even though it is an excellent point  shoot it is also feature packed and can be adjusted manually with many different options and settings if you want. 
 
Things to look for in any camera in the compact/ultra compact category:
- Picture quality, of course
- Image stabilization so shaky hands dont ruin the shot
- Fast shutter lag times and shot to shot times
- Face detection software
- Good OPTICAL zoom (not just digital zoom)
- Great battery life
- Large LCD screen
- Adequate megapixels to enlarge and crop your images when needed.  Also to print larger sized photos.

This camera has all of the above.

PROS:
Wide angle lens
Excellent picture quality
10 megapixels
Image Stabilization
Face detection and a self timer with face detection
Ultra compact
Fast Digic 4 processor - Almost instant start-up  fast shot to shot
4x optical zoom and 4x digital zoom
Large 3 LCD screen
Motion Detection
Intelligent Contrast
Multiple pre-programmed picture modes tailored for the best shot
Easy to use controls and interface
Attractive

CONS:
No viewfinder (LCD only).  Some prefer viewfinder - personal preference.
May be too small for some people - again, personal preference.
Its not cheap...  But it is a good value.  You might spend more, but you get a lot more.

I have taken many great shots with this camera since Ive had it and really couldnt wish for more.  This camera has got to be on anyones short list when shopping for cameras in this category...  Can you tell that I really, really like it?</Content>

<Content>The SX 10IS in not just your average camera, but a movie maker too. The lens on this camera is amazing. Equivalent to 300 mm in focal length, its not removable from the camera body. This is great because youll never contaminate the CCD in this gem. It has a well thought out selection of pre-sets, but still offers ease of manually configuring settings yourself.  With the SD 16 gig Extreme III Card, (the only one you should buy for this camera) in good lighting, it can snap off 3.5 frames per second of action in continuous shoot mode. Canons Digic II processor and Face recognition auto focus, make this camera well worth more than youll ever pay for it. This camera is feature rich, well built, and has too many extras to mention here.
Altho the lens will not  accommodate filters, I managed to fit one on and found the camera takes much better photos with out it.
  I was recently surprised after taking hundreds of photos, and finding the next day had battery power for hundreds of more using standard AA batteries. 
Just behind the flip-up flash, is a hot shoe for a more powerful flash, if you think youll need one. But Ive found the flip-up flash adequate for anything within 40 feet in total darkness. The infra red focus assist in darkness is a priceless, well though of, feature. Normally the camera uses its brain to focus in light on the subject, But if it cant see the subject or object in the dark, the infra red kicks in and gets the job done.
The software included with the camera is compatible with my Mac OS 10, and Canon customer care is the best in the USA. I really dont think its possible to find a better camera for the price. As each day passes I keep falling in love with how well this camera helps me share what I see with others. </Content>

<Content>The camera is awesome! The flexibility to allow for a wide range of modes is exceptional and not found on most point and shoot cameras.  There is a learning curve for those of us who have not had a Cannon digital but given time I have managed to become capable of using quite a few different modes.
Patience is the key to becoming proficient and productive with this very powerful camera.  Cannot be beat in its price range!!!!!!</Content>

<Content>Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom  The best pricing was through Amazon from Crutchfield.  The delviery was to be 3-5 business days and it arrived on the 6th, which meant I did not have the camera for a planned trip-poor planning on my part too.  The camera replaces a Canon digital that suddenly broke and was too expensive to repair.  I have had the camera for 3 weeks now, and I am happily impressed with the features and results.  I am an amateur who likes to take close-range and distant photos but without the hassle of changing lenses.  My old Pentax retired years ago.  Surprisingly fun is the ability to take videos, almost like a cam corder.  Also fun, is when the memory card can be put into the Panasonic TV slot and the photos make a slide show on a 50 plasma!  I think this camera offers great flexibility and results for the amateur; with the need for more performance, but not the need to spend money on a camera or lenses that are rarely used.  I am a professional complainer and critic so it is rare to report that I am recommending something.</Content>

<Content>I am very happy with this versatile camera.  I was thinking about buying a camcorder and a still camera but this camera meets all my needs.  The audio is good even though you cannot connect an external microphone.  Battery life is good, zoom range is good, picture quality is very good with auto focus and auto exposure.  I like the panorama feature that allows me to stitch multiple shots together.  This camera is a great value.

<Content>This is one of the most feature packed little cameras Ive used. The first hint is the nearly 300 page manual. It really requires reading at least twice, with camera in hand, to get a grasp on which functions are ones you will use and which ones are of lesser interest for your style of shooting. From focus bracketing to overlap assisted panoramic mode to in camera image editing, the SX10 IS will amaze you with its capabilities. If you arent interested in spending some real time to learn what this camera can do for you, buy a simpler camera with a fully automated mode and save your money. This camera is geared toward the person that uses a camera frequently and can remember how to access its many helpful features. Of course, it has a fully auto mode if you want to hand it to a person to snap away for you, without having to know what every button does. 

Next comes the most important reason for buying any camera - image quality. Again, this camera can hold its own. This is a very small sensor camera. There is not a camera on the market with this size sensor that is going to produce high ISO, low light images that amaze you with beautiful, highly enlarged images. Youve got to step way up in size and money for that kind of shooting. Otherwise, the SX10 IS will really surprise you. Im astounded by the great images I can get up to ISO 400. Even ISO 800 shots are more than acceptable in decent lighting situations. 

Combined with a Canon 580EX II, you can get some fantastic flash photography. Admittedly, this is a huge flash for such a small camera, but I already had one so I use it. You dont give up the best features of the flash with this camera. Many cheaper cameras wont use many of the features of the high end flashes. Not so with this combination. Things like high speed sync that allow very short shutter speeds are supported. 

And of course, there is the main reason most people will even consider a camera in this league, the ultra long focal range. Combined with the easy portability of this camera, the lens makes this a great camera for doing it all. You can really stretch out there with a 35mm equivalency of 560mm focal length. The cameras IS feature allows you to hand hold the camera and still get good shots at this focal length in good lighting. The 28mm short end of the lens is quite good too. 

As you can probably tell, after several weeks of using the SX10 IS, I am excited over this camera. To say it has replaced my Canon DSLR for casual shooting is an understatement. It has become my preferred camera in situations I never dreamed it would be used. If I dont need extremely short depth of field or very high ISO, super low noise images, this is the camera I pick up. It comes as close to a do everything camera as I have found.</Content>

<Content>Nice colors. Great zoom. Quiet  smooth zoom operation. Decent view finder with diopter. Lots of functions. Decent low light performance. Improved video performance. Pictures are sharp and clear up to 400 iso. After that, typical noise visible.  Stereo sound. Uses 4 AA batteries instead of 2 thank goodness. Too many buttons in places where accidentally pushed too often  too easy. Easy to block the auto focus beam with your finger. Autofocus has been inconsistant.  Especially indoors, or in lower lighting situations. Ive had blurry pictures where I didnt have before or shouldnt have. Im no pro but, I do take a lot of pictures. Some were published by the College where I work. I like the camera but, I find the inconsistant autofocus cause for concern. My powershot A710is is more consistant in autofocus. Also experiencing inconsistancies loading pictures onto the computer using Canon software  attaching the camera/computer via the cable supplied. Sometimes pictures load ok, other times, the process stalls. I found that using a card reader works better for me. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software, but no change. All in all its a nice camera.  For me, focus lock  patience is a must. It just doesnt focus quickly/easily everytime indoors or in lower light situations. (like im used to)</Content>

<Content>I have had the S1  S2.  This is a worthy upgrade.  I did not think they would be able to imrpve the 10X optical zoom on the S1 without stepping up into a SLR model...then they came out with the 12X optical(S2  S3).
I also love the wide angle lens.  I can take a picture of a group of people in a living room without stepping way back!  As far as I am conerned this is the best camera you can get without going to SLR.
The only thing I am bummed about is the size.  It still is the same size(roughly) as the S1,S2,S3.  I guess you cant have your cake and eat it too.  How else can they pack a powerful lens in a small package.  If you want a pocket point and shoot, this is not the one.</Content>

<Content>I just got back from a weeklong vacation, with over 1000 photos on this camera (having just gotten the camera a few days before the vacation). I would not say that any of the bad photos were because of the camera. Quite the opposite, I think it rescued some that would not have been very good on my older camera.

The clarity and color on the photos is very, very good. In all kinds of lighting, from bright sunlight to normally lit rooms. Indoors I used the full manual mode a lot, with ISO 800 and 1600. I havent tried printing anything, but on a 1920x1600 screen things look great.

I also took about 12 minutes of video of my sons middle school orchestra, needing to shoot at ISO 1600. The sound quality was more than adequate from the rear of the auditorium. Definitely good enough to show the relatives.

Overall, the camera has a lot of strong points - LCD is bright and the swivel helps get a lot of shots that would be impossible otherwise. Previewing manual mode shots is very good. The zoom is very quiet, and with all the sound muted (Im not into having my camera make cute little noises) the camera is silent. Manual mode is easy to control with the scroll wheel. Super macro mode is great for flowers, etc.

Cons - the lens cap has no tether. The lens hood will obscure the corners of wide angle shots. Its going to put a strain on my storage space, going from 1MB photos to 4MB photos (not really a con, but worth realizing). Im not fully comfortable with the manual focus mode yet.

I had dithered a lot about whether to get this camera or a low-end DSLR. In the end, the lower price and the convenience of not having to mess with changing lenses won out. After seeing the first photos, Im happy I went with this camera.</Content>

IT KEEPS FALLING OFF AND I ALMOST LOST IT TWICE. THE CAMERA IS TOO HEAVY  AND FAR TOO SENSITIVE IN THE HANDLING. YOU HAVE TOO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW YOU HANDLE THE CAMERA BECAUSE IT CAN INADVERTANTLY CHANGE SETTINGS WITHOUT YOU EVEN REALIZING IT. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A CANON USER BUT THIS ONE HAS PROVEN TO BE DISAPPOINTING.
I DID NOT REALIZE THESE THINGS BEFORE I BOUGHT CAMERA. I ASSUMED INCORRECTLY THAT THE LENS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE WHEN SHUTTING CAMERA OFF. ALSO THE BULKINESS OF CAMERA DID NOT MAKE HANDLING CAMERA EASY.

<Content>I spent a few years waiting  researching  asking others with Sonys, Nikons, etc., concerning digital cameras that would suit my needs, basic indoor, sports  wildlife in Yellowstone (all times of day  night). This camera has a lot of zoom, enough pixellation to enlarge pics w/o losing quality, and a movie mode.  I had been using an old Sony camcord with a Sandisc card to snap photos  make movies, I wanted the same options with a digital camera. I can film movies and can snap stills at the same time.

Other advantages: it runs on 4 AA batteries that seem to last forever which means no battery pack (or expensive lithium batteries) to run low just as a herd of antelope shows up. Very easy to download pics into computer. Its not tiny but it isnt heavy or awkward. Only dowside, the lens cover is easy to lose (I tied a thread to it so its now attached to the strap). Price is very reasonable.  Took a few years but I feel I made the right choice. 

Compared to other brands that offer much of the same (except Movie mode, which few seem to have) Id recommend this Canon SX10.</Content>

<Content>  So many things in one relatively small camera, wow!

  Lets start with the lense.  Very wide angle, careful to keep your foot out of the picture all the way to 20X zoom.  Stood on the beach shooting an island a mile away and zoomed to people on the island beach not visible with the unaided eye without changing lenses.  You are looking through the lense in this DSLR with diopter control if you wear glasses.

  The DIGIC 4 is the computer chip that arranges pixels from the 10meg digital CCD.  Even most triple priced DSLR cameras do not have this next generation digital chip yet.  They have the DIGIC III (3).  Want to change colors in the picture or black and white pictures with or without one color?  It will take some time to learn all the composing powers this SX10IS has to offer because of the DIGIC 4 chip.

  Needs 4 AAs instead of two like my other pocket cameras.  That adds to the size and weight putting the SX10IS into a heavier catagory BUT way lighter than most DSLRs.  Easy to hold with one hand.  Four batteries means the right handed grip protrudes more with a nice little lip for your second finger to fit into to leaving your first finger on the picture button.  

  Several hundred pictures down the road with many armchair reviews in the 2 1/2 LCD that pulls out and swivels no battery change yet.  AAs are cheap and available everywhere.  Wont even bother with rechargeables because one set lasts so long the rechargeables will run down waiting to be used. Two and half inch LCD and not highly detailed but adequate.  Zooming in while reviewing taken pictures nice.  I suspect that DIGIC 4 is helping too.

  SX10IS is not a pocket camera in size or weight.  Last trip to Mexico took the 590IS which is pocket size along with this one but never used it. 20X and wide angle and other features were so nice to have.  Generally I do not try to carry a camera ALL the time.  Like to carry with one hand and wrist strap.  Never around my neck.  

  Smallest quality bag that fits is the LowePro Apex 100AW roughly 3 1/2 x 4 1/2 by 6.  That is pretty darn small. Plenty of room for batteries.  Too small for instruction book.  Tossed the neck strap and cut the water proof bag off to gain storage.  I carry bag with built in handle.  Usually just carry the camera without the bag.  Think I bought this from Amazon.  Might also fit in shoulder bag where you carry other things.

  Settings for special picture conditions like night, or action, or many many others extensive. Auto seems to come pretty close to compensating for most pictures.  And you have all the manual choices too.  If you shoot a lot of pictures in specific lighting conditions you can set ISO, shutter speed, etc then record that group of settings along with multiple others as custom choices easily selected again later.  DIGIC 4 again?  

  Easy camera for no-brainer shots.  If you are a technocrat that likes many composing elements here is a camera that offers choices you never imagined.  Movies with sound and zoom, yes!  Panorama 180 or 360 degrees...........or just pick it up and shoot.  

  I would suggest this camera is an excellent choice that fits above point and shoot and below much bigger much more expensive, change the lense, type cameras.  Moms that just want a simple, small, light camera, might find SX10IS more than they wanted...........unless you want a close-up at the other end of the soccer field when your little hero kicks a field goal.  It is just not an easy walk around, carry it all the time, type of camera.  It is a super-power camera of picture choices that will look spectacular in you large digital picture frames.

  P.S.  Just noticed Consumer Report gave this camera a 78 rating.  Among all the other digital camera categories only one had a 78, Nikon D300 which is in the advanced section and costs $1600 before you buy lenses.  No other camera of any type rated as high.  Type of personal usage still determines which is best.  Multiple photographing choices make up for being a little larger than a point and shoot for me.             </Content>

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I was considering a DSLR for a while, but I wasnt really planning for the full commitment that DSLRs require.  I wanted the convenience of a point-and-shoot, but the abilities of a pro camera.

Ive used a Canon Powershot before (I cant think of the model), and Ive grown accustomed to the ease of use and quality of the photos, so I picked up the SX10IS because it had the features I was used to, and the features that I wanted.

I am not disappointed.  After taking some trips to the baseball stadium (Go Giants!) and a couple hiking trips, Ive been able to take -- from my perspective -- some really incredible shots; ones that I couldnt have otherwise done with the Powershot I used to use.

My only complaint regards some mild, dark spots in my photos, especially in my zoom photos.  Ive cleaned the lens as much as I could, with no results.  After doing some research on the internet, it appears that the sensor may have dust on it.  Since this is a closed system, I have no way of getting to the sensor to dust it.  Its a mild annoyance -- I can clean it up with a computer -- but enough of one for me to bring it up.

Im very satisfied with this camera.  Once I bought a bag for it, I intend to take it everywhere and learn all its features.</Content>

<Content>I am so pleased with this purchase. I originally wanted the nikon p80 when i first started looking at megazoom point and shoots and when I finally played around with it, it just seemed dinky and the pictures werent great. I waited and came across the canon sx10 is, I am so glad I did some more research because it is a world of difference from the p80. I have taken a lot of pictures with this camera and the image quality may not be quite as sharp as a dSLR (just slightly lower) but the color is absolutely awesome. When I heard about the p90 (12.1mp 24x zoom) coming out I thought maybe it would have had the edge over the sx10, but after reading reviews comparing both of them, the sx10 still beats the p90 in image quality. I am thoroughly impressed with the canon sx10 is. I would highly recommend it. You cant beat a 560mm zoom lens for the price. If you are wavering between cameras, stop, this wont disappoint. </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera after a series of other Canon ps camera (PowerShot series).  I was very happy with Canon for the past 5+ years using either the powershot IS or the ELPH series cameras.  Lately, I had a need for extra zoom for taking shots of kids at school stages, etc., so I reviewed several super zoom cameras.

Pros:
o Zoom is great, although some reviews do not like that the camera shutter speed slows down as you zoom further out (at 20x, the fastest you get is 1/500)
o LCD vari-screen is quite helpful (as opposed to the fixed LCDs in PS), specially when taking low shots of kids or birds, etc.
o I didnt miss many of the automatic scene options I got used to in prev Canon cameras
o I like the super macro feature a lot.  I took some close up shots of a basket of oranges - great professional focus on the near orange surface, with short depth of field, and blurred background!

Cons:
o In automode, Im just not seeing the image sharpness in the normal zoom range.  The camera takes great shots of close-up pictures. Great details can be found when viewing on screen.  But try something 5-10 feet, and the AF just doesnt lock sharply.  Same in face-detection mode, even as the face is framed well.  I compared very similar shots from powershot and this camera. It just doesnt look consistently sharp. Ocassionally Id get one or two sharp ones, but then Ive had to work quite hard to do that - several adjustments of aperture, speed, etc. like some very old SLR shots without any auto features. 
o Images are very grainy, specially on the black colors even at low ISOs
o The highest resolution is 10M, then next down is 6M, which leaves a big gap on resolution.  Id prefer 10M, 9M, 8M, etc.
o The flash doesnt auto pop in any mode.  Id have preferred that in auto mode that it pops up (like one old SLR I had), to retain the feel of a PS when needed
o Id prefer a rechargeable battery.  I take many pictures, so what is better to carry around, a large box of batteries or a charger?
o The sport mode is disappointing!  I put it in sport mode and took several pictures of birds, some of my fish in the aquarium - not a single sharp shot!  Yes, I have steady hands :-)

Im somewhat happy with the features and superzoom and Canons reputation. But, Im not able to decide whether to try another camera before returning this.  Some symptoms indicate I may need to learn a few techniques, but I think at least the automode and scene modes should do as expected from sub $200 cameras!  Ive had it for a week and taken shots in many situations, and Im thinking of returning it.

<Content>I received this camera 3 weeks ago.  The first problem was that there was no memory card included with the camera.  So when the start-up section of the instruction book said to take a picture to check the operation of the camera, it said it couldnt store the picture because there was no memory!  

The next problem happened when I recorded movies on the memory cards which I had to run out and buy.  The ZoomBrowser software was unable to transfer the movies to the computer.  Canons tech support solution was that I either could go out and buy a new computer because I needed both a lot more memory and a faster processor or I could leave the movies on the memory card and hook the camera up to a TV and watch them that way, thus tying up my memory cards.  At $50 a pop, thats a pretty expensive solution.  If you want a lot of frustration, buy this camera.</Content>

<Content>My 11-month-old Olympus died just before I was scheduled to leave for a three week visit to England. Olympus would not honor their warranty and I refused to pay nearly $200 to repair a $300-camera and ordered this one instead. Free shipping from Amazon got it to me the day before I left so I had no time to become familiar with it, something I was apprehensive about since Id never owned a Canon but it was not difficult to use at all. I bought a 16GB memory card in London so I would had lots of space available to practice but found I really didnt need it. I got some great shots and some very good videos of my friends birthday celebration with a minimum of deletions. (I also use it to take photos for newspaper articles I write.) Definitely not disappointed and I give this one a huge thumbs up for quality and ease of use and to Amazon for quick service.</Content>

<Content>After many weeks of research and reading of reviews on multiple different brands and models of cameras, trying to find a replacement for my Sony P72 which I was unhappy with before it broke, I settled on purchasing the Canon SX10IS. Checking out some review sites that showed pictures taken with the differnt cameras, the pictures taken by the Canon SX10IS were better than any pictures taken by other superzooms in the same conditions and settings. Besides good picture quality, it also has all the features I was looking for in a digital camera: full manual controls, a camera that wasnt small and easily lost, AA batteries, and good macro and wide angle capabilities. When I was looking for the camera I didnt realize I actually desired a good zoom capability as well. In my first actual use of the camera at a baseball game where my sons class sang the national anthem, I found myself thanking myself for having gotten one with 20x zoom. I was able to get good pictures of him by home plate while I sat in the outfield nosebleed cheap seats. Im loving the outstanding zoom capabilities.

In all of my tests and real world use of the camera Ive not been let down. It performs just as well as the reveiwers said it would. I switched to rechargable AA batteries, but I wasnt able to drain the four alkaline AA batteries that came with it, before I replaced them before the earlier mentioned baseball game, and I took about 150 shots with the alkalines. Ive taken video and about 200 shots with the recharables and havent yet drained them. I do have a backup set of recharable batteries for when I really get to some extended photo sessions, but I dont see needing more than the one extra set. I have no complaints about its battery life.

I was also very pleased with its image stabilization. I was able to take pictures at extreme zoom that I know I wouldnt have been able to take clearly without it. I also took some macro photos without using a tripod, hand held only, and got some very clear results.

Im glad it didnt come with a small memory card like some other people complain about. My old Sony came with a 16MB Sony card which was all but useless, as I could only get 12 or so pictures on it. Nobody has a use for that small a card. The SX10-IS not coming with one allowed me to get one of the size I want and not have to be saddled with a wasted card.

My only complaint is that it is fairly heavy and youll definitely want to use the neck strap. You wont want to hand carry this camera around for long periods of time.

I do not regret for an instant purchasing this camera. I know I would have been unhappy with other models had I chosen differently. Its my first superzoom and with its similarity and functioning similar to a DSLR, it has me seriously thinking about taking the plunge into the DSLR realm at some point in the future after I improve my photography skills. In the mean time there are some third party add ons that can expand its capabilities to be more DSLR like until I decide to take the plunge.</Content>

<Content>This difficult to find camera is the perfect digital high-end camera for both a beginner and camera professional.  It is a point-and-shoot for the beginner but allows the user to learn by overriding any automatic function and practicing till the desired pictures can be captured.  I do not yet have an external flash, but the built-in flash works well.  The camera has a built-in viewfinder; however the digital mini-screen on this camera is unique and more usable than on other cameras I looked at.  The unique swivel feature allows for use at any angle to capture the expected picture.  I am still learning about the features of this camera including the excellent zoom capability but I am extremely please with the relatively compact size and features the camera possesses.</Content>

<Content>I love this camera. My previous was a Canon S1 IS and I loved that one also. The images with the SX10 IS are fantastic. I love the 20x zoom capability and with the 10 mega pixels is a great improvement over the 3.1 on the previous camera. I love the swivel LCD screen and use it quite often. I personally like the bulk of this camera - I have a real problem with the thin pocket size cameras being able to handle them properly. It will take me a while to become proficient with all the new features on this camera as it would with any new camera with so many extra features. For someone with limited financial resources and who simply wants to take snapshots, there would be better choices but if you are wanting to take more than simple snapshots and have the resources available, you wont find a better camera with tremendous features and value for the money. I couldnt want any other camera as much as I love this one. Only one small complaint - the digital connection cover is awkward to open and awkward to insert the cable to connect the camera to the computer. Fantastic images.</Content>

<Content>I was a long time user of the Canon EOS SLRs and I loved them.   I say that only because readers should know I am an experienced photographer.  I make this review after using this camera for about six months.  Ive had plenty of time to put it through its paces in various situations.

First let me say that Im not comparing the SX10IS to an SLR but rather to my Panasonic DMC FZ20 with 12X zoom Lieca lens.  The Panasonic is an excellent camera, by the way and I recommend it highly.

The Canon SX10IS camera has been a big disappointment.  It was purchased mainly for wildlife photography.  The  20X zoom works fine, but its bad points far outweigh the one good feature this camera has.

1. First the lens.  The images are soft, not as sharp and crisp as the ones from the Panasonic.  This could also be the auto focusing mechanism.   Near, far, where ever the subjects are, the focus is soft.

2.  Camera design is poor.  Buttons cover every available surface of the cameras body.    My small hands just cannot hold the camera without pushing one of the numerous buttons that cover the cameras surface.

3.  I wish they had not attempted to cram every conceivable feature  into this camera.   More is not always better.  The menu is a nightmare to navigate.  No changing settings quickly to capture a bird in flight.   Thankfully they left out the wash and spin dry feature but that is the only thing missing.

4.  The optical viewfinder, which you need to use when shooting wildlife (especially if you are a former SLR user or if you wear glasses), is very poor.  The view is fuzzy and the viewfinder is very small.  

5.  The camera body is cheaply made.  Handle it very carefully.   For example the door to the memory card is hinged with cheap material that will easily break with much opening or a slip of your fingers.  

6.  When holding the focus at 20X waiting for a subject to turn just the right way the camera makes a chugging sound and the image jumps.  That cant be good.

These are my main complaints about this camera.  Some advice:  Dont just order this product online.  Hold one in your hands, do some trial shots.  Try to use it as you would in your everyday photography before you purchase it.  Look at other camera models and compare before you buy.

<Content>Heys guys, this is indeed a sweet camera. Great features which have been covered in other reviews already. This is to simply provide an alternative to applying a filter on the end of this unit. It was not designed to carry one as is. But there is a solution. Amazon does not allow links in these reviews since mine was removed. But the companys name is Lensmate. They do have a website. This company has come to our rescue, knowing how important a protective filter is. So voila! An adapter which will accomodate any 58mm filter or step ring.  I bought mine I also got the lens cap and a UV protective filter ring from this company. A god-sent for sure.  Now lets get to shooting some serious pictures without the worry of scratching our camera lens.

<Content>I bought this for my son for Christmas to take on a trip to South America.  I had done my research and knew it was a great camera.

My Review is about my buying experience not the camera.

I went online, found the best price at one of the NY camera houses only to to told a few days later that the camera  instruction book were the Japanese version.  For another $30 I could get the English version.  Needless to say I cancelled.

I placed the order a second time with another camera house only to be told the camera was not available.  They tried to upsell me - once again I cancelled.

I had just about given up on the camera when I went to search one more time. 

This time I found the camera here on Amazon.  With the free postage the cost was only about $10 more than the least expensive I had found to date.

I placed the order and had the camera in 8 days.

My son trekked around Patagonia and took wonderful shots both at close range and distance using the 20x zoom.  If it is not the best camera in its class out there I dont know what is.

The MORAL here is save yourself the aggravation of dealing with the NY camera houses which are known for somewhat questionable tactics.  Just order it from an Authorized Amazon seller!!!

<Content>The most outstanding features of this camera are its rather incredible potential focal length (i.e., 20x zoom), its high resolution (10MP), and its rather open configurability. 
In my own case, the SX10 replaced a Canon S3 IS, a marvleous 6MP camera with which I obtained quite amazing photos. The SX10 is just about the same form factor, though deliberately a bit easier to grip, but delivers sharper images at all focal lengths, far longer focal lengths, and somewhat greater and much more easily accessed control of the settings for individual shots. Like its predecessor, the SX10 does not allow for saving shots as .RAW files, which is probably a good thing for Canon, because if they did the rationale for buying their mainstream digital SLRs would be less compelling.
I like Canon equipment very well and was inclined to upgrade into their product line, but compared the SX10 with as much of the competition as reasonable before biting the bullet. THe cameras I fussed with the most are the Canon G10, which adds .RAW files but has a much more limited optical zoom capability, and the Panasonic DMC-LX3. I nearly bought the latter, in fact, because it has much higher resolution video available, but at some cost to picture quality. Ultimately, I decided that Id use a video camera for videos, and hence picture quality won out.
Aside from its limited f-stop range (endemic to its competitors), and its rather odd failure to include .RAW files, the limitations of the SX10 show up in comparison to digital SLRs. Aside from a comparatively circumspect range of f-stops, the focusing alternatives tend to be more restricted, the photo quality above about ISO 400 deteriorates pretty obviously, and the time between photos at maximum rep is actually lower than for the venerable S#. So if you spend a lot of time taking action photos, or shooting pictures at very low lighting, then consider the G10 or its competitors. If 90% of your shots are taking in reasonably lighting without lots of action, as are most of mine, then you will be VERY hard pressed to find a better compromise camera. Its not perfect, but thats not the point of a compromise, is it?</Content>

<Content>Pros.
 Excellent zoom
 Decent Low light performance

Cons.
 Noise in pictures
 You may need an external flash

I bought this camera to replace my 6+ year old canon S50.

I was expecting the out door 10MP picture would have been noise free. Unfortunately the AUTO mode picture created significant noise.

Surprisingly My old S50 5MP picture has less noise than the new SX10.


Other than that this camera is excellent


Update: 5/6/09
Had some research why this camera has more noise that my S50.

The pixel density SX10(35MP/CM2) vs S50 (13MP/CM2) - Means the sensor in SX10 is packed tightly than in S50

<Content>Ive been a (more or less) serious photographer for almost 70 years, and  an earlybird with practically every technological advance in photography since then. In other words, Ive seen em all.

Digital is the great revolution -- nothing in the past comes close to that leap forward. I migrated to it 10 years ago, have owned a dozen or more cameras, and havent looked back since.

Disclaimer: Im not a professional photographer. What photos I sell might cover my expenses plus a little (13 x 19 prints take lots of expensive ink). I dont have to produce near-perfect work day in and day out in a studio or on assignments. Those who have the talent and energy to do this work should have whatever equipment fits their needs. They earn it.

I, on the other hand, am among the legions who have the luxury of picking and choosing when, where, and what to photograph. I can make as many errors as I do without damage except to my ego. I can play around with subject, setting, lighting, color, mood, and all those little things that differentiate photography from cellphone snapshots. I dont pay penalties for my goofs.

Ive had my Canon SX10IS for a only a few weeks, but I can conclude that its value for the money is simply incredible! Whatever nits I can pick (and there are a few) are more in the realm of digging through its scores of features and trying to decide which to use; not in the overall quality, which is simply outstanding.

That said, I have to object to what appears to be an ongoing undercurrent of disdain for anything-but-SLRs that keeps coming up in product reviews. Aside from larger CCD sensors, I cant find anything significantly better in most SLRs than in the mid-range non-SLRs such as the SX-10. After decades of lugging several bodies and a half-dozen lenses around in multiple suitcase-sized bags, missing shots because it took so long to screw everything together, while paying many thousands of bucks for the inconvenience, Im absolutely liberated from the SLR and hope I never have to use one again. The SX10s incredible 20x wide-angle optical zoom eliminates any need I might have for multiple lenses -- Im not a telephoto zealot. The ease of use eclipses any extra features the SLR might have. The historic SLR advantage of an image seen through the taking lens has been made obsolete by the electronic viewfinder and LCD screen that see through the lens. All thats left for the SLR is lens super-quality and interchangability, more light-gathering ability, and snob appeal. Most of us wont improve our non-professional results much, if at all, with these technical advantages. (I can use Tiger Woods $10,000 golf clubs and not take a stroke off my score. But he can take my $750 set and shoot under par right out of the bag.) 

There are mossbacks out there who cling to the notion that if it aint film, it aint photography; and that if it aint an SLR, it aint a camera. Nonsense. It aint the equipment, its what you do with it.

Oh, and by the way -- the best camera is the one you have with you. For me, its my Canon SD-1100-IS thats always in my pocket; my SX-10-IS is now the one that rides around with me in my car; while my SLRs and bags of lenses languish at home in the closet.

These are serious cameras for the rest of us. Bless you, Canon :-) </Content>

<Content>When choosing a camera for my travel and scenic photography, I looked at reviews of many. This Canon won mainly for these reasons:

My style of shooting demands a 28 mm equiv. wide angle lens.

My style of shooting also demands use of a polarizer filter. This is possible with the excellent [...] adapter ring. 

I prefer AA battery power. Lots of chargers and inexpensive backups are always available. 

Upon close scrutiny of the many photo samples available thru online reviews, Canons seemed the sharpest to me. There is a little purple fringing on contrast edges, but same with most cameras. 

Overall, the camera is quite a bargain for the solid build and features. 

All that is good and would rate 5 stars, but this camera is a little frustrating in daily use. The exposure compensation is fussy to activate... the little selection wheel has no feedback feel and WILL cause you to use curse words more than once. Also, the controls that come up first in the function setting menus are organized badly. It isnt hard to use this camera if you like Auto or Program modes, but the deeper settings for those who like to use them could be set up better. Also, I have no idea why Canon offers such a serious camera that doesnt take filters without an extra adapter ring. </Content>

<Content>I have been watching this camera for a few weeks and finally decided to purchase it. Im not a power user yet, although I plan on getting to learn on how to use all of its functionality. I have only had it for a few days but so far Im very impressed.

Pros:
1. Fantastic zoom
2. Great image stabilization
3. Auto mode works well
4. Lots of scene features (fireworks, sunset, etc.)
5. Very impressed with the stereo sound when recording video.
6. I like that you can mute the camera..good for taking pictures of birds or other animals that may get scared by the cameras natural noises.

Cons:
1. Although the video recording lets you zoom in and out, I found that once I uploaded it to my PC the outcome of the video was very jumpy. I will try again with less zooming.
2. The instructions, although clear, go on forever. Thus I purchased the Canon Powershot SX10 IS CheatSheet from Amazon. Im happily waiting for it to help me start using the cool features faster than if I read through the entire manual. 

I did do my research via Cameralabs.com where they have live video showing you how the camera works.

Overall...5 stars!! Im excited to take it on a trip to the Grand Canyon in a few weeks.</Content>

<Content>This is a great camera for a point and shoot.  The zoom lens is nice but still gets blurry at times.  The camera is heavy and made of good quality.  The dial is similar to SLR dials so it seems to be a good stepping stone to a SLR.  However, the clarity is not quite as good.  The nice factor is being able to carry around one camera with the lens attached instead of having to carry around multiple lens, etc.  The red eye feature is one of the best I have ever seen.  I was able to capture beautiful close up pictures of flowers with vibrant colors, as well as capture fireworks scenes, and sunsets.  The features are nice.  The camera is easy to use and learn.  Seems like a good starting point before a SLR purchase.</Content>

<Content>This is a great camera.  It has met every expectation I had; and I am very difficult to please.  The zoom and image stabilization capability alone make it worth its relatively low price.  The amount of functionality contained in this product is amazing.  I read the manual, but I doubt Ill ever use most of the functions; its like a laptop inside a camera.

The only negatives are: the larger size (Im  used to a Cybershot that drops inside my pocket, but this is a reasonable trade-off for the power of the camera); the fact that it didnt come with a memory card, rendering it unusable out of the box (cmon Canon, you couldnt include a lousy $4 memory card?); and that a rechargeable battery isnt designed into the unit (battery life is very good, but this isnt a particularly green product).</Content>

<Content>Having previously used the Canon S2 IS, I looked forward to using the SX10 IS, and I was not disappointed. The SX10 IS is all I expected and more. Ive looked for things to be critical of, and can only find two minor ones; the door covering the USB connector is a tad loose after first use, and the movies are stored in MOV format rather than the AVI format that was used by the S2. As my video editing program (Pinnacle Studio) wont accept MOV files, a conversion step is required. There are plenty of free conversion programs available that can be used to solve the second problem (I use format factory). The 20X optical zoom, 10 megapixel resolution, comfortable feel, and long battery life (with rechargeable NiMH batteries) makes this a tremendously versatile camera, and its all there without the need for interchangeable lenses. The quality is what Ive come to expect with Canon cameras. I recommend this camera for any serious amateur photographer, and it just might do it for beginning professionals.</Content>

<Content>I had to send my Fuji S9000 in for repairs so to get me by, I bought a Fuji S2000HD. Well, I was soooo dissapointed with the colors and lack of depth, faces washed out, horrible. I wanted to wait for the faster SX1is but I went back and bought the Canon SX10is instead. 
The Canon SX10is is very well built and feels solid, impressive lens, zoom in all the way and grab some blur-free shots you wont believe! Grab birds out of the sky! I dont know how I made it without Image Stabilisation all these years. I like the common sense menus, the AA batteries (I use 2900MAH NiMh) and they last all day. 
  The zoom has two speeds, Fast to get to where you want it and slow to fine tune the zoom. During Video, only slow zoom will work (makes sense). The grip could be bigger but I have large hands. Auto does very well, but sometimes I want to customize the flash settings and It does that well. My Fuji S9000 has almost NO shutter lag or delay, when I pre-focus before the shot, Its INSTANT. With the Canon there is a 2-4 sec delay (with flash) but it can be reduced a little through the Menu settings. You can set it to P, Force Flash and It will pull off continous shots at around 1.5 seconds one after the other.
  For a PS up against other PSs I give it a 4.5 stars but here in the real world up against cameras that are also within reach, Nikon D40, Lumix G1, Its a solid 3.5. I am glad I own this camera.

I recently took it to Aruba and the pictures are amazing.  I have always been disappointed in the past cameras I have bought with the zoom.

<Content>This camera is what we were looking for. We wanted one camera with the versatility to capture everday life. This camera is great for taking pictures at a distance, like shots during the the school play or on the ball field. Without changing a lens you can zoom in on the detail shots, like a butterfly landing on a vibrant flower or fish under water. I was going to wait and pay more money for all the same features as the new PowerShot SX1 IS. I am glad i didnt. This camera has been worth every dollar. Previously we had a sony cyber shot and this camera lacked in quality and capability when compared to this camera. No comparison! You actually feel like your holding a sturdy camera not a toy electronic device. I just wish it came with the power cable for down loads. You have to buy that seperate and Canon recomends using one for downloading.</Content>

<Content>Canons SX10IS is great! Here are the things I like the most from this SX10 IS:

Pros:
1. 20X optical super-zoom with IS and USM: its focal length (5-100mm) covers most of the ranges practically needed; IS  USM are definitely positive additions; 
2. Lots of manual options available. If you really like digital photography, then you know what I mean. Like the AEB feature, allows you to compose your own HDR photo, etc.
3. Design (including its weight): The design is just right, not too high profile, not too humble. Hear some complaints about the weight, but for me that is part of quality. It is still much lighter and portable than a SLR, isnt it.
4. More...

Coms:
Only some small things I dislike: lens cap --- they should use a small string hooking up with the body; Neck string: dont use it. Material of the string is kind of rough, it will bother you big time while hold the camera.

Overall, if you have limited budget and still want a decent (not just an entry level), rich featured with more manual options digital camera, go for SX10 IS!

<Content>The Canon SX 10 IS is a great little camera - very versatile and capable.  Controls are pretty easy to master, and I love the long zoom. I still have to refer to the manual, theres a lot to master about the little bugger.  The fold-out LCD window can be a distraction, I tend to just leave it in the back of the camera.  Takes great pix. I intend to get an external flash, the built-in flash is too severe for good interior evening shots. 
 Highly recommended.</Content>

We were just at the beach for a week and I could zoom in on boats out in the Gulf of Mexico so clearly you could read the name of the ship.  When you put it into macro you are zooming in at 80x when at full zoom!  It is wonderful!  I am only 1/3 thru the instruction manual and can not believe what all this camera can do.

I am a complete rookie when it comes to photography.  I wanted a point and shoot camera that I could grow into.  The x20 optical zoom does truly take fantastic pics of the moon.  This camera allows you to point and shoot and take fantastic photos.  However, there is also the manual and program sets that will allow you to create custom settings. (This is where the grow into comes in.)

The photos Ive taken have been tremendous and have changed how my family lives their lives, lol.  Always ready to pose for Mom or stop the car for that shot.

At this price (at the time of this $380 min) is a valuable investment.  I look forward to using this camera for year and years to come. I have graduations to capture=)</Content>

<Content>Over the last few years, on trips, I have alternated the use of a Canon Digital Rebel SLR and a Nikon Coolpix 7900 point and shoot.  I found that the Canon Digital Rebel became a real problem in the point and shoot arena. It was heavy, required lens changes, was hard to conceal in the rain, and bulky.

The Nikon was really too small, the settings hard to read, it was sensitive to vibration, had a fairly low resolution, and did not have a long enough zoom lens.

In December, I bought the SX10IS, because it seemed to be the best of both worlds. AND IT WAS! On a trip around South America, we encountered every conceivable situation and this camera exceeded in every category. It is lightweight, small but not too small, has a great zoom lens, great resolution, image stabilization, no lens changes, can be hidden under a rainsuit, and produces superior images.

Recently, a lens adapter has become avialable that accepts 58mm filters.

I would highly recommend this camera as a great all-around winner.

<Content>Although I own several Nikon SLR digital cameras along with numerous lenses, I decided to try out the Canon SX10IS for a recent trip in stead of logging all those heavy lenses along. I was not disappointed. When by chance I came upon a large crowd of parrots devouring tree blossoms in San Francisco, I was able to capture the phenomenon with this camera hand held. Several other professional photographers present expressed envy, since they were crouched in various contortions with their 18-inch lenses on tripods, only to get the same results I did.
The numerous direct-control features on this camera were also a welcome change from the command menu layers one normally will have to content with on most equipment of this type.
But many of the controls and menu items are quite confusing, requiring extensive reading of the manual. In other words, they require a good deal of preparation. They are not naturally logical.
Even so, this is a most capable camera and well worth the price.</Content>

<Content>I already own a Canon S3 and bought this camera as an upgrade in focal length.  I like to shoot nature photography.  I took the new camera to Monte Vista, CO to shoot the sandhill cranes that stop over on their migration north.  I shot about 1000 pictures and if I got 20 in focus it was good.  Nothing in the frame is in focus in most pictures.  Not the mountains, not the trees, not the birds. I read the instruction book cover to cover, studied the settings, made changes.  After 3 days of shooting I came home very disappointed, packed up the camera and returned it.  If you are looking for the added focal length forget it.  The photos are uniformly soft which I guess is good for something, but not for me.  </Content>

<Content>Greetings-- since the release of this camera I have been following all the user reviews on Amazon and the consensus seemed to be overwhelmingly positive. Based on the user reviews and other research that I did, I pulled the trigger and bought one. I was really excited about getting this camera because it sounded like the next step up over what I currently have. 

When I received the camera I began running it through its paces. Very soon into it I began to see issues with the camera.  Moving beyond those though, I started taking test pictures using all of the different settings available.  I then loaded the images to my PC and began looking at them. What I viewed was very disappointing. First off, the images were not sharp. Secondly, the colors seemed muted and they were not very accurate to what the actual scene looked like. Lastly and on closer examination, I was stunned to see large amounts of purple fringing. This is a problem I would expect on earlier generations of digital cameras, but not now and not on a Canon. What is really sad is that purple fringing is most common in high contrast areas; with my test pictures high contrast scenes were not the case. The purple fringing explained the lack of punch, sharpness, and color accuracy. Thinking I may have received a defective camera I did some Googling. To my surprise I found other people were reporting the same problem with this camera. 

I have to tell ya, prior to this Canon purchase I had used a Kodak Z650.  The images I get from the Kodak blow away anything I got out of the Canon. Needless to say, the Canon was returned for refund. (I want to thank Amazon for the quick and painless processing of the return.)

Here are some other issues I found with this camera: 

1. The selector wheel that is used to navigate within the menus did not translate properly. I found myself spinning it around several times before it would begin moving the cursor. Along with that there was a stickiness to it. It would stick and youd have to apply more pressure for it to turn, this in turn caused the cursor to jump father than you wanted to go. It was frustrating to use. You can get around all that by pressing the dial down in the corners for the direction you want to go. That seemed to translate well but it is more time consuming. One click equals one position in the menu. If you want to reach the end of the menu youd have to click your way through one position at a time. 

2. I feel the menu layout and functionality was poorly designed and not very intuitive. There are too many layers to navigate through and too many ways to get where you want to go. Here again, my Kodak does a much better job in accessing the options and settings. And just to be clear, the Kodak has many of the same SLR functions to choose from. My point being, its pretty much an apples and apples comparison.  The Kodak is extremely easy to navigate and very easy to learn. Canon could take some lessons from them.  Im not trying to sell Kodak here. The Kodak has its own issues.  The one main thing going for the Kodak is that it is capable of producing some stunning images, and that is the very least Id expect from a camera.

3. The camera is pretty heavy as others have reported.  Its not a problem for me but I think it is worth mentioning again.

4. I found that the lens cap falling off was not a problem for me, but taking it off was.  I found this primarily true when you are using the lens shield that Canon supplies.  It was difficult for me to fit my fingers between the inner lens shield wall and the lens cap where the releases are located.  It was very clumsy and difficult to squeeze the tabs in order to release the cap.


I would have overlooked notes 1 to 4 if the image quality had been there. Sadly for me it wasnt.

When the neck strap is attached, you cannot hit the Power button easily. However with the strap off, it is heavy and bulky to hold because of all of the batteries.  It takes wonderful videos, with incredible sound when you play them back on your computer.  But for the price, I think I can live with it happily.</Content>

<Content>Bought the SX10IS recently.  Had done a lot of research prior to this decision as I was really conflicted whether to invest in a DSLR or a prosumer camera.  In the end, given my usage, I think I made a very wise decision. 

The range of this camera is fantastic.  Like most canon products it is very technologically advanced and it did take some time to figure out options.  It probably has more than I will ever use.  

Got some good results in very low lighting and it was not as large or heavy as I expected it to be.  The zoom lense is simply unbelievable but a tripod is required for really exploring the distance.  

This is second camera and again a Canon.  I had waited for Digital tech to reach a point where it becomes worth investing.  This camera fit the price, quality and feature equation perfectly.  In my view, its a better buy than an entry level DSLR. </Content>

<Content>I bought two machines at Amazon.com (one for me and one as a gift) and, well, no complaints about the shipping and absolutely no complaints at all about the machines. 
Im not a pro but I always wanted a cost-effective deal that would allow me to take better pics of landscapes during my trips. This machine has good and firm grip, crispy quality pictures, awesome movies with the zoom capability and great sound. It isnt a portable camera, so you better consider buying a nice case (not the Canon one) for the camera itself and all the stuff you might need (extra batteries, memory card, cables and so on).
I suggest anyone that is interested in buying this camera to check first for some serious review before going ahead. It is good to know that a new model is now available (SX1 IS) with new features.

<Content>Just got this camera and am still playing with it.  So far, the pictures are outstanding and the zoom is unbelievable.  In fact I brought it to work and several people immediately went to Amazon and ordered it.

Pros:  ZOOM!  AA batteries (you would have to be on Mars to not find those readily available), LCD display

Cons:  Like everyone else has said, no filter capabilities.  But if you go to Lensmate Online, they have just made a filter adapter that works like a champ.  It changes the lens diameter to 58mm but it is a great fit.
.MOV - sorry, I am use to using Windows Movie Maker to edit movies.   So I had to download software to convert to .avi in order to edit. Just doesnt seem right.

<Content>Wow! I am very pleased with the Canon Powershot. I am (was) one of those people who resisted on converting from film cameras to digital. After a lot of research, time, and many questions to people whom uses digital cameras I finally decided to purchase one. 

What I wanted was a digital camera that was VERY easy to use and would take GREAT pictures of my very active Grandchildren. The Canon Powershot exceeded my expectations. 

The Canon Powershot can go from the box to taking great pictures in just minutes. No special camera batteries needed, which who keeps them on hand, it takes double A. I can and have recommended the Canon Powershot to my family and friends.

</Review>
<Review>
<DocID>B001G5ZTZO-100</DocID>
<Content>I purchased the SX10IS because I really liked my S3IS but I wanted the 10MP so that I could print out large high quality prints of my wildlife pictures.  I havent had a lot of time to test the camera out, but one thing that I have found that I really am disappointed with is the new video format.  The old AVI format is much more compatible with my programs then the new MOV format.  Also, the SX10 only offers two video qualities, both at 30 fps.  The S3 offered 5 different video capture settings.  I made full use of the video mode on my S3, so I was really upset to see the changes.  The 20X optical is really nice, unless you need more zoom, because you are not able to attach a telephoto lens.  I have a telephoto lens that attaches to my S3 which really gives me the extra zoom that I wanted (about 36X optical), however it needs a lot of light to produce good pictures and takes up a lot of room in my camera case.  The SX10 does have threads that accept a 52mm UV filter or polarized filter, even though canon wont admit it.  It is bigger and heavier than the S3, but not enough to cause problems.  Both the S3 and the SX10 auto modes are a let down in low light conditions, however for the amateur wildlife photographer the auto modes will allow you to quickly take good quality pictures without any adjustment from the user.  In low light conditions a tripod and manual camera adjustment are a must to get good pictures.  
Conclusion: For the $$$ it appears to be a good buy for 20X 10MP camera.  I would have liked to see the same video settings as the S3, especially the lower resolution 60 fps option and the cameras auto focus doesnt do as well at full zoom as expected.  Maybe I should have waited for the SX1 to get down to a reasonable price, or just purchased the S5IS.    </Content>

Im able to create some of the same kind of light effects and adjustments that pros do with SLRs for a fraction of the cost.  Dont get me wrong, if youre looking for a professional camera, this is NOT professional grade, but if you are an amateur looking for high end features, great lens capability, and/or a stepping stone to learn how real photographers do what they do, this is a GREAT buy. </Content>

<Content>I have had this camera for 2 months now.  Have used it in every circumstand I can think of.  I have been very pleased.  

1) battery life.  Alkaline battery life is only about 100 pics for me.  I use Rayovac Hybrids and I can easly take 400 pics with these.  I imagine with Lithium you could reach 600.

2) picture quality.  It isnt an DSLR but sure is close.  Qualtiy is very good in any lighting conditions.  You should be able to print any picture any size you want.

3) Zoom. Amazing.  I have taken pictures zoomed all the way with out a tripod and they are almost as clear as if I was right on top of item.  The image stablaization worked perfect everytime.  (I do not use the digital zoom)

4) Video -  Love the dedicated button for video.  I have had many cameras where I always wished they had something like this.  The qualtiy is not HD and you can buy their model that has it for $200 more but I dont know that it is worth it.  The video quality is great in my opinion.  If you really want an HD video camera I would suggest buying a seperate HD video camera.

5) features - lot and lots of great features. The color swap and where you can make everything black and white except one color is pretty nice.

6) ease of use.  Everything seems really intuitive to me.  Everything is right where it should be.

I dont think you can go wrong with this one.  I did a ton of research and dpreview.com and digitalcamerareview.com before I bought this utla zoom camera.  Thought about getting a DSLR but I really wanted the zoom.  You can get this great camera that would probably meet your needs for under $400 or easliy spend $1200 to get a comprable DSLR with this zoom capacity.  </Content>

<Content>I typically shoot a Nikon D50 SLR, but for my recent trip to Hawaii I bought this camera so I wouldnt have to lug around any lenses. No camera bags or the like at Pearl Harbor so its a pain to lug around extra lenses for the SLR but you want to have a nice long lens at the same time since Pearl Harbor really is an all-day visit. This camera solves the problem and then some. This allows for manual settings, as well as aperature and shutter priority that are typically only on SLRs. I was a bit skeptical if I would really like this camera since Im used to SLRs - I love it! Simply stated, my shots were fantastic! I couldnt have done any better with my SLR (and this maybe did a better job than that - yikes). The resolution is astounding - I got such tight shots at the Pro Bowl with it too and I was no more than 10 rows from the top of Aloha Stadium. People cant believe I actually got the shots I did with this camera - I almost cant even believe it!  My 52mm UV filter from my Nikon fit this nicely, but my 52mm circular polarizer (made by the same company as the UV filter) did not.  It didnt matter - I got such beautiful shades of blue in the sky and water without it, though sometimes it is nice to have the creative control that the filter offers.  At the Pacific Aviation Museum I was able to shoot crisp, clear photos indoors without using the flash or a tripod when I put it on the Tungsten setting - outstanding results that exactly captured the Museums lighting.  

I still prefer my SLR for more formal portraits and macro work, but for nearly every other type of photo the SX10 IS will likely be the one I reach for first.  Im recommending it to everyone I know whos looking for a camera thats more advanced than a typical point and shoot, but who doesnt want to get into the SLR realm.  An enthusiastic 5 stars and kudos to Canon!  Well done!

My suggestions for making the most out of this camera:
- The rechargeable batteries promoted by the bunny with his drum work very well with this and last a good long time, even with moderate to heavy use.  I have the 15 minute recharger that has a car adapter too, which is handy for people like me who travel a lot.  Consider a second set of rechargeables to have ready at any time or at the very least keep 4 AA batteries on hand as a back up.  Overall, dont go on the budget plan for your rechargeable batteries for this great camera - youll get what you pay for.  
- If you want to keep your charger with your camera then dont buy a bag online - they probably wont have the capacity to hold both the camera and the charger unit.  Go to a local retailer and pick one up there.  
- Get a 52mm UV filter, blower brush, lens cloth and cap keeper while youre at it.  They should total no more than $25 and are well worth the small investment.  
- Consider picking up the laminated cheat sheet that an Amazon retailer offers.  I found it by typing the cameras name under the books menu.  Its about $15 with the shipping, but less cumbersome than the manual.  If nothing else it helps you locate where in the manual to look for some of the more advanced settings.  </Content>

<Content>Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom
Resolution is excellent even at the longest zoom.  LCD Monitor is large and easy to read and navigate.  However, in both the camera and software there are way too many features to wade through in order to get the basics.  The camera was delivered promptly but with unrechargeable DEAD BATTERIES dated 2005.  Cheap shot on the part of Canon.  I had to buy new batteries.  </Content>

<Content>Having owned a Canon Powershot S1 IS for several years, this camera had many familiar touches. There are some differences, too, so there is a bit of a learning curve. However, the more I use the camera, the more I appreciate the changes. For example, to set the self-timer, I push a button on the back of the camera instead of one on the front top. The view finder is much more clear and the LCD screen is significantly larger than previous models - and very usable when I choose to not use the view finder. What I like about this over many cameras in its price range is that it has multiple automatic settings and it has manual settings for the serious amateur who wants full creative control over what the camera does. The ONLY down side I have found is that the camera really does not support lens filters. I have been able to gently screw the 52 mm UV filter from my old camera in place, and I have not had any problems doing so. But I can tell the few threads on the lens are not really intended for this use, so I wont be changing filters any more than absolutely necessary. If Canon would make that one change, I would say this is the perfect camera for someone who does not need the step up - in both price and weight, as well as cost - of a full DSLR, but who wants to do much more than point and shoot.</Content>

I accidently hit buttons I dont mean to hit at times, and the 20Xzoom seems to take a few seconds to focus - but may be the operator, not the cameras fault.  Still learning how to use it.

<Content>Much has been said in earlier reviews so Ill limit my review to subjective feedback.  This is my 7th digital camera, including use of a Canon XSi. Ive had limited shooting opportunities with this so far, but am VERY impressed with how capable it is.  Ive shot several shots now at the full 20x zoom and am very surprised by the high level of detail captured by this lens (see sample photo of a shore bird on the beach).  Video quality is likewise superb and is one reason that this is my take-everywhere camera.  The fact that it has a hotshoe allowing you to add a pro-level flash (e.g. 430EX) adds to the versatility of this camera.  Also appreciated is the swivel LCD.  This is a carry-over from older models.  Few cameras offer this now.  For most shooting, I prefer the optical viewfinder, but youll be surprised how many uses you find for an LCD like this.

Is this camera for you?  That all depends on what youll do with the camera. The zoom feature (including wide angle), combined with excellent image quality, is really what pushes this camera over the top for me.  There is very little you cannot do with this camera.  The downside is that it is not a pocketable camera.  It is fairly large and heavy.  But if you dont mind the bulk, the camera will reward you with some great shots and video.  It is worth a serious look.</Content>

<Content>The Powershot SX10 IS is the best overall camera you can purchase for the money.  Money saving features are as follows:  AA batteries, SD Card, 28mm to 560mm lens.  Batteries are a big thing.  Rechargeables will not last forever, they wear even if you arent using them.  When you need batteries, at the last minute, you can use Alkaline AA.  For your typical tourist activities the lens will be more than enough.  The SD cards are the cheapest around.

The one additional feature the camera has is the menu/picture review screen. The screen works much like the screens on Digital Camcorders.  It allows moving the camera overhead and around corners or is just convenient for use when taking self-portraits on a timer.  You can rotate the screen around to point in the same direction as the lens.

No other camera, other than the SX1 IS w/CMOS, combines all these features.  Since the SX1 IS is currently only being sold in Europe and Asia, at the time of this review, and any warranty work would be problematic this leaves out this camera. Its an extra $300-$400 extra the same price as a SLR, but you still have AA batteries and SD card.

The picture quality is great, the addition of full manual control, VHS quality video and a High Speed ISO makes this camera a great buy and a bargain.

<Content>What can you say about this camera other than spectacular value probably the best buy out there on the market today.I am convinced that you wont find a camera out there with this impressive feature set with canon quality and world class imaging technology in such a compact package for this very reasonable price.When it comes to advanced point and shoot cameras the powershot line is the benchmark by which all others are measured.In fact it is a misnomer to classify this camera as just a point and shoot it is capable of producing excellent images with an astounding 20x zoom range and a feature set that is incredible period.However with that said entry level DSLRs are closing the gap with aggressive pricing stratagies squarely aimed at this segment of the market.This might be something to consider if you have contemplated making the jump DSLRs still produce the best quality images because of the sensor size and type(CMOS)very low noise levels even at high iso sensitivities.If your not ready to convert this camera would be the perfect bridge,solidly constructed with built in image stabilization for shooting long zoom shots and an array of settings that cover most any situation you will encounter.I highly endorse this product I think you will be delighted with its performance and amazed at its versatility.</Content>

The faster shutter response and quick focus is wonderful.  Low light level conditions result in far less noise and I find Im using my flash less as a result.  The camera fits my hand better than the old S3 but both were/are a bit slicker than I like.  And yes, the lens cap sucks; its hard to remove quickly and Ive already lost it once.

<Content>I just received this camera after months of research.I narrowed it down between the sx10 and the fx28. I now know I made the right decision with the sx10. Any bad reviews on this product can only be for three reasons.
they are canon haters, they dont know how to operate the camera, or they received a defective camera. This camera focuses spot on quickly in light or dark areas.The picture quality is close to dslr quality. The movie mode is as good as my sony digital handy cam.The camera feels great in your hands and there are so many options that it is a great camera for photo enthusiasts. It is also a  great point and shoot camera if you dont want to get into all of the options. The purple fringing everybody talks about is absent on regular size prints. If you blow them up the pictures look beautiful, with vivid scrumptious quality. If you purchase this camera make sure you buy the 4000 leather case made by canon for it. they go well togeather. Like I said dont listen to the negative feed back. True it doesnt have raw, But I know it will be available on wiki soon for a download. Dont hesitate get it now Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoomyou wont be disappointed.</Content>

<Content>I havent had this much fun with a camera since my ancient Canon A1. I really like the ability to switch between aperture (Av) and shutter speed (Tv) priority. And I find its much easier to use the viewfinder than the LCD screen (so it was important to me for my digital camera to have a viewfinder). And until I looked at the differences (in the manuals appendix) between Auto and Programmed modes, I wondered why have both ... now Im glad I looked.

One of the first things I did was to turn off most of the cameras helpful settings. I am a big fan of fixing things like contrast or red eye AFTER downloading the photos to my computer ... not having the camera pretending to know what I want better than I do. And I usually only want to target a portion of the image ... not the entire image that these helpful settings attempt to fix.

Others have complained that the lens cap is easy to lose ... but I got so used to putting my Canon A1s lens cap in my pocket as soon as I took it off (it didnt have a lens strap either) that I just kept following that practice with my new SX10IS.

One of the things I like the most is the fact that it uses standard AA batteries. My previous digital camera (a Nikon - because the lens is what matters when taking a photo) used a proprietary battery that was difficult to find at times (even the store where I usually bought the battery was occasionally out of stock).

The popup flash allows me to place a loose fabric over the flash to reduce the flash brightness (something next to impossible on the Nikon with its flash built into the housing). I havent yet upgraded to the Canon Speedlight flash ... but its nice to know that I have that option.

For me, the biggest drawback is that the shutter release button is placed a bit too far forward for my tastes ... but thats a small problem. Not everyone has the same requirements for a digital camera as I do ... but Id say this is one of the best (unless you opt for the hugely expensive DSLRs). Read all of the reviews and see if what people say matches your requirements ... but I can say that Id recommend this camera for anyone who is even a little serious about their photography.

You can do a lot with this camera before you run into an option you wish the camera had.</Content>

<Content>After being in the Sony camp with its DSC-F707 for almost seven years before it finally died, I was going to stick with the company, but when others came out with 20x zoom I gave in to diversity (since nature photography is a big thing for me the zoom is a godsend). I purchased a camera from another company only to send it back because it never seemed to focus when it said it was focused, so I wasnt sure what Canon could do in its place.

Boy am I glad I gave them a try. I have yet to find anything wrong other than no lens cap tether (but it clips onto the strap so Im not crying or anything yet). Even at the far end of the zoom (yea, even in the digital zoom) the pictures are great. Its hard to keep a subject in frame in the high end of digital zoom unless you can keep the camera REALLY still- the image stabilization keeps adjusting for your slightest twitch, but that was expected. I stumbled on great subjects on my first trip out with it (heron chicks, kingfisher in midair) so that probably helped. I can even take better self-portraits since the rear screen revolves out and around so you can check your framing while being in front of the camera!

Something tells me Ill have this one for as long as itll have me. Good job, Canon!</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera to replace my older point and shoot Canon because I have recently gotten into racing photography and graphic design for my business. I needed something a little more high end without going the full digital SLR route. Honestly, most people that carry around the SLRs and 4 lenses are total overkill anyway. The shots from this camera I can almost guarantee you, are just as good as theirs.

This camera has totally exceeded my expectations in both picture quality and ease of use. The manual adjustments on this camera make it really easy to adjust settings for various environments, including racing photography. The size of the camera is perfect and I love having the flexibility of it without having to buy or carry around 10 different lenses, flashes, etc.

I have tested this camera out on all sorts of different subjects and it really produces great shots across the entire spectrum. For the money, I really dont see how this camera can be beat. Unless you are some stalker paparazzi type of person, this camera should fit most any photographic need you have, while still being a simple camera to operate.

I find the layout of the buttons to be quite nice, contrary to other reviews. The screen on this camera is also really nice, but I rarely use it.

My only negative for this camera (as others have mentioned) is that the lens cap needs a string on it or some way to keep better track of it.

Overall, a great camera that I am extremely happy with. I have purchased Canon products for the last 10 years and will continue to do so. </Content>

<Content>I was so enamored by the reviews of this camera I couldnt wait to get it.  But the reality was such a disappointment Im returning it to Amazon tomorrow.

If youre accustomed to using an LCD or digital viewfinder for shooting pictures, then youll probably love this camera.  Im not, and I dont like them one bit.  I had no idea optical viewfinders are becoming obsolete.  Is this really technological advancement?  I took dozens of shots with this camera, but couldnt even see my subject clearly.  (Yes, I adjusted the diopter wheel.)  All the photos either came out blurry or the subjects head was chopped off.  Ive been a photographer for many years and have even been published several times.  Im no pro, but Im not a novice either.  

Sadly, the digital viewfinder was a deal-breaker for me.  Ill have to pay a re-stocking fee and a fortune in shipping costs, but thankfully I can return it.  I learned the hard way.  I suppose one star is harsh, but I cant tell you how disappointed I am, just two weeks away from a month-long trip to the Himalayas.  Buyers be aware of what youre getting.  </Content>

With the sx10is and the s3is everything is there. Might loose some image quality but not enough to to make up the inconvience of lugging the lenses.  This is my fourth digital camera. </Content>

Behaving still like a compact camera it has some of the goodies you find on a big guy, the lenses let you even take super macro pictures (to put the camera as close as you can, even less than 10cm to obtain amazing results).  You can attach an extra flash, even a remote controllable one, so that you can experiment with image results.

The only drawbacks are its weigth, and the use of batteries, but considering the size of the lenses weight is almost impossible to overcome.</Content>

<Content>For many years I was a 35mm SLR format photographer. 5 years ago switched to to Canon S50 point and shoot 5MP. Had excellent results. I did miss some of the features and picture clarity of the 35mm but wanted to retain conveniences of point and shoot. This new Canon is the best of both worlds. Having had lots of experience with Canon previously, I found it very easy to use. Going from 5 MP to 10MP-results are astounding. Im getting results from this that I previously only got from 35MM SLR. Definitely recommend it. The snap a pic while taking a video is the icing on the cake!</Content>

<Content>Firstly, Im not a professional photographer by any means. However I do know several people who are, and having run it through their tests and mine, can say that this camera is great for the price point. I say almost professional because you wont be getting photos in National Geographic with it (unless youre really good). For a wedding photographer, lesser journalist, or professional Ebay-er it meets and exceeds what one requires. Its also just fun to play with. Alright lets talk features. The 20X optical zoom does not disappoint, with sharp focus corner to corner. Add in an additional 60x digital zoom for a whopping 80x that allows for stunning close-ups with suprisingly low distortion/color noise. With the very aggressive tremor reduction its possible to get clear pictures of the moon without a tripod! The ability to lock the focus by holding the shutter button halfway is another standout feature for un-cooperative subjects. Additionally the burst shooting mode works well, with low lag. It can get some immpressive action shots when combined with the 3200 ISO high shutter speed mode. Lets not forget the plethora of packed in modes and tools. Photos can be resized, cropped, and colors tweaked directly from the camera without navigating 15 menus. The latter color editing is merely choosing from optimized presets, but works well enough for a pack in. Shooting modes range from fireworks to aquarium, are readily accessed by spinning a dial and are genuinely useful. Some of the more artistic and interesting ones are the color swap/color accent which swaps a color you pick from whatevers in the viewfinder, and the more striking color accent which renders the whole image slightly greyscale except for a user selected color. It looks really cool when used to highlight trees/plants/flowers. Speaking of the viewfinder, it sports a mini LCD with crisp image and bright backlight. The main LCD is equally clear, if sometimes too bright to accurately judge whether you got the colors/lighting you wanted. My advice, use the big LCD to show off your pics or as a reference. When in doubt check the viewfinder and trust it over the exterior screen (lower res. but better contrast, besides real photographers use the viewfinder!). The external LCD has a neat feature of rotating the image as you rotate the camera to keep it upright. If you take a pic sideways the camera will automatically straighten it out while preserving the taller aspect ratio, a nice time saver. I could keep going for pages but these are just a few of the things that really sold me on it. To cover a few gripes for good measure, the manual is HUGE and some kind of awful confusing. Best bet is to skim it to find out what buttons do what and then put it away and experiment(You were gonna do that anyway right?). The included software is clunky and boring, but you probably knew that. The flash works well enough, but to Canons credit it features a hotshoe for remote flash which I recommend. The battery life is not terribly immpressive either, typically a fresh set seems to last 4-6 hours. Closer to 6 if you judiciously hide the big LCD. If you like to show off your work, get a battery pack and recharger and prepare to use it ALOT (That goes double if you use the flash often). All taken into account this camera is literally THE BEST you will find without taking the plunge into $700+ professional territory. A great investment, or a fun toy if you have disposable income.</Content>

<Content>I ordered this camera in December. I was at first not happy with how long it would take amazon to ship the product, but pleased that it was shipped quite a bit earlier than the estimated date. It was well packaged and everything was in the box, and in perfect condition. 
 I love the camera, even though I still have a lot to learn about it yet. It seems to have many features that I at least seem to be impressed by. The zoom is great and works very smooth. Batteries seem to last quite a while, I think even better than my older smaller Cannon. Picture quality is very nice. Camera seems to focus really well. I noticed when you zoom in close though you need to wait a couple of seconds longer before it focuses in. I love the flip out LCD screen. The movie feature is great too.
I was at first interested in an SLR camera, but since I am not a professionl I am happy with what this camera does for what I will need to use it for. Maybe someday I can become a professional at photography</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera and took it to Disney World where I had a chance to try out all the features in all kinds of conditions. This is one step down from the DSLR cameras where I dont have to change lenses and it takes great pictures. Overall I am impressed with it and I feel it was worth every dollar I spent on it. However, this is a must: READ THE MANUAL AND LEARN THE FEATURES IF YOU WANT TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THIS CAMERA! Here are some pros  cons :

Pros:
1. Clear pictures at full zoom as well as super macro mode even when the camera lens is so close it touches the object.
2. Many features to adjust for different light conditions (learn the features and make adjustments)
3. Takes good pictures in low light or almost no light conditions even without the flash (again, learn the features  make adjustments for it) but at very low light conditions I recommend putting the camera on a tripod or have very steady hands.
4. Records clear movies with stereo sound  zoom. .mov format can be played with QuickTime Player on Windows XP with no problems.
5. Flash power can be adjusted to how far you want it to reach so the background doesnt get washed out.
6. Swivel LCD for multi angle viewing.
7. The colors come out beautiful.
8. Wide angle lens. You can fit more in your pictures.
9. Batteries last a long time. I use rechargable Eneloop AA batteries.

Cons:
1. Its a heavy camera with the 4 batteries in it, even when its hanging around my neck.
2. Its a rather bulky camera for a woman. Women have smaller hands and sometimes its hard to get a good grip on it.
3. The lens cap. There is no string attachment for it! It has a piece of plastic on the back of the cap to attach it to the camera strap but it doesnt work. It doesnt clip on strong enough so the cap falls off anyway. 
4. The Fireworks feature is useless especially when there is another lit object around the fireworks (expl: Magic Kingdom castle with fireworks around it). The camera asks me to make adjustments (which it shouldnt since its a set feature), but no matter how I tried to adjust it, it didnt work. Instead, I used the Sports feature and that worked just fine. All other features work well.

So overall I give it 5 stars for the money spent but I cant stress enough that this camera will only do the tricks if the adjustments are made for it. It also takes great point-and-shoot pictures but if thats what you are planning on using it for most of the time, I recommend buying a less expensive camera. This is my 4th Canon camera and I find them to be excellent and very durable.

<Content>My old A series powershot died after 3 years so I decided to get a more powerful camera with better optical zoom than the 3x I had previously.  I love this camera for the price.  The cameras need to fit the purpose and mine was to have a powerful zoom without losing the ability for video which is why I did not upgrade to a SLR type.  I mainly take pictures of my kids. I like the shot to shot speed of this camera and I can get the kids in action while having great clarity, focus and no jitter.  I especially like the fact it uses plain AA batteries.  I wish the lens cap would attach to the camera but thats a small con to the many pros.  I didnt read any instructions and was able to figure out where and how to operate the main functions of picture review, delete, video settings/volume, flash, and ISO within 15 minutes of turning on the camera.  The pictures and video is great to view on a computer or tv.  I do like the flip out screen because my old one had scratches from being exposed where this screen is protected by closing inward.  Modifying zoom while taking video is also a nice feature to have.  I am very pleased with this camera and purchase...now I have to find a case.</Content>

<Content>Im a bird watching freak and wanted a camera that would allow me to get closer to my subjects and capture fast motion (birds in flight).  This camera does not disappoint!  With the 20x optical zoom, I can get as close as I need to without sacrificing picture quality.  I received it yesterday morning and went out the birdfeeder to practice with it.  In 30 minutes, I managed 10 of the best bird photos Ive ever taken.  I also went over to Lowes garden center and photographed new spring flowers and am very happy with the colors.  A butterfly made an appearance and became an unknowing subject thanks to the 20x zoom.  The pictures are just gorgeous!  I really love this camera.  </Content>

BUT, I shoot 90% of my pics as action such as swim meets, cross country, triathlons etc.  I was soooo disappointed in the lag in the camera.  I took it to my sons swim meet and couldnt even get a shot off before he entered the water.  My S3 I can get about 2-3 pictures between the start and him entering the water.  I tried sports mode, manual with high ISO and nothing made a difference.  So it is going back to the store I am afraid.  </Content>

<Content>As someone that takes pictures as a hobby, this is a wonderful camera. Still learning all of the functions. But compared to my Sony Point and Shoot this is 100% better. What I noticed right away is the color is  true, there is not alot of adjusting I have to do in my editing program. I also love that the screen flips out and turns around for self portraits so there is no guess work to where you are at in the frame. I used the movie mode a few weeks ago and the picture and sound were great. The Macro feature is great for flowers and close up shots, And the 20X Zoom for distance shots. Very happy with my purchase. </Content>

<Summary>Canon SX10 IS Review</Summary>
</Review>
<Review>
<DocID>B001G5ZTZO-164</DocID>
<Content>I am a novice to this type of camera. My older camera is a Canon A80 which I like. Naturally I found this Canon SX10IS to be a little confusing and intimidating. However, I found the cure for this was, and is, practice and study. 

I first tried pictures of the moon which were disappointing. The focus was not good (just a fuzzy yellow ball) and the digital zoom was set on from the factory. This meant that the zoom was 80X. Even with a tripod it was difficult to keep the moon in the camera sight. I set the digital zoom to off and I recommend that it never be set to on. If you want a closer image  you can crop the picture later. This is all the digital zoom does but which a lot more fuss. I then set the focus to spot and got a great picture of the moon. 

The 20X zoom is especially nice. I live at the ocean and can photograph fishing vessels just off the coast or seagulls sitting on a post in the harbor. Distant mountains are drawn up and the foreground foreshortened. This can produce very wonderful pictures that you cannot get with a lesser zoom. A tripod helps to keep the camera steady on many occasions. 

I tried the SCN setting (on sunset) for the first time and got dramatic results. I tried the same picture with the normal setting and it was just okay. With the SCN setting some people said that I should sell the picture commercially. 

Pictures in the camera can be viewed without turning the camera on as it to photograph. This may seem like a small thing but I found it to be useful and battery saving. 

The camera uses 4 AA size batteries. I believe that prior versions of this camera used the speciality lithium battery which is a major reason I didnt buy it before. I have known too many people whose photography during a vacation was cut short by a depleted battery. AA batteries can be purchased anywhere in the world and in my limited experience so far battery life appears excellent. 

I am enjoying the camera. It is just darn fun to use and try new things. I can get results in it that I never could get with my Canon A80. </Content>

<Content>REALITY CHECK! I am a camera freak, I just love the things. I own the SX10 (and previously a stack of other digital cameras ... starting with that SONY MAVICA with the 3.5 diskettes a LONG time ago), and love it. I previously owned the S5, and it was also excellent. I bought the SX10 for the awesome LENS CAPABILITIES, and have not been disappointed whatsoever. It takes magnificent pics, has that enormous range, is COMPACT, and has that heft to it that gives it the feel of a serious camera. Now: for the REALITY CHECK: I just bumped into the Canon 40D and 50D models at a local store. Youve seen them: big, hefty, big lcd (without the cover the SX10 has ... can already visualize the SCRATCHES from shirt buttons, etc.), big lenses with those ridges on them that seem to beg you to pick it up and zoom in/out. Then I remembered: I bought the 30D some time ago. Bought all the lenses, external flash, cards, batteries, case, etc. Took it home and, after the battery pack was charged, went into the picture taking drill. I was shocked! A cheaper camera that I had took brighter/clearer pics than this EXPENSIVE get-up I just bought! I took a stack of pics with both: same result. I brought that set back to the place where purchased and that was that. There is no doubt that the 30D was worth the price, to demanding pros, but not to me. And this is the point I am trying to make: for the AVERAGE JOE or Jill, you probably dont need all the bells n whistles these advanced DSLRs certainly deliver. If you are NOT a pro, NEEDING to manipulate a zillion settings manually and exchange lenses to match what you want to accomplish, this SX10 is probably gonna be PERFECT for you! You will not have to buy an array of EXPENSIVE add-on lenses (read the reviews for the 50D, for example, and you will see that super camera is, in the end, lense dependent ... that is: the end results will depend on the quality of the glass you have attached. This can get to be a VERY expensive proposition for all but the very serious pros). If you, like me, just want GOOD PICTURES without all the fuss, then ... in my very humble opinion ... this SX10 is probably all you will need for the remainder of your time on the planet :-) (I will admit, after putzing with both the 40D and 50D, I found it hard to walk away without buying one/the other. Its almost impossible to not be overly impressed with their great appearance, obvious wealth of options, and heft value. But, remembering my experience with the 30D, and the fact I obviously was not ready for multiple lenses, and the complexities involved with high-end cameras, I walked away). You can read the attached excellent reviews on the SX10 to find all about batteries, external flashes, bags, etc. 

Wishing to add a comment/two about certainly real concerns that run through these reviews: LOSING THE LENS CAP and DROPPING THE CAMERA. For the initial concern: go to RITZ CAMERA, for instance (AMAZON probably also sells this), and buy the QUANATRAY LENS CAP LEASH. It affixes to the lens cap and the camera body, problem solved for $1.99. As far as DROPPING the thing ... DONT!! I use the CANON WRIST STRAP (bought mine via EBAY) and really like it. A thin over-the-neck strap came with the unit (which I dont particularly like), USE IT! But, do ensure the LCD SCREEN is COVERED when walking around with that neck strap to not scratch the lcd with shirt buttons, etc.

UPDATE:  2-17-09:  IM BACK ... again. I could not resist the urge to get another SLR. I bought a real GOOD one, bought more lenses, flash, etc. AND, just like the one I brought back before, I BROUGHT THIS ONE BACK! The BOTTOM LINE is: THE PICTURE. This expensive array did NOT take better pics than the CANON SX10IS! I am sticking with this GREAT Canon FOREVER! It does EVERYTHING ... and in a wonderful small package. No lenses to lug around and have to change as the scene demands ... just zoom on from 28mm to 560mm(!) without missing a beat. Super camera!

<Content>I upgraded from the S2 IS, an excellente camera.
To see an extensive and deep review of the superzoom cameras check this:
[...]

If you are looking for a digital camera with more zoom than 5X, the SX 10 IS is the one.  You will have 20X, Video mode in just a button, snapshot while filming, zoom while filming.  Picture quality is superb, a lot of modes, like Auto, you just point and shoot, Manual, you perform your own scenario, and a lot more.  If you like to make close-ups, the Macro mode is unique, you can put the object at the lens 0cm, and works perfect.
If I had to change something, I would give the lens more aperture, it comes with 2.8-5.7, I would like 2.8-4.5.

Go for it.

<Content>a good cam, dont listen to the low light stuff, just learn how to use M mode. Its a tool, and ya gotta learn how to use it, read the manual and take lots of test shots. Its big, but that makes it stable, and the view finder lets you use your head as a tripod. Vibrant color setting makes a difference, and IS set to shot makes a difference. Use the highest image quality setting, spend the [...] bucks and get a 8 meg card. Shoot with the lowest ISO you can get away with. I think my pics rival my brothers D50 dslr in quality. The 20x zoom lets you play around and get some cool background/foreground in/out of focus shots. The stereo video is cool too. The wheel thing is fine once you get used to it, would have been better if it was like the sx110, which is also a good cam.</Content>

<Content>The Canon Powershot SX10is is a great little camera.  Its lens is amazing going from extreme wideangle to extreme telephoto (in 35mm equivalents 28mm to 560mm).  The ten megapixels enables you to digitally zoom out even further to 80 power.  

I am a birder, and I wanted a handy camera to take picture of birds that that will yield a picture good enough to prove that I saw a particular bird.  It is so nice not to be chained to a heavy tripod and a heavy birding scope in order to photograph birds.

My pictures dont match the best pictures made by serious bird photographers with expensive outfits with long telephoto lens and converters, but it gives me surprisingly sharp pictures.

The only criticism I have is one that I have read in other reviews.  The camera has a wheel to select a feature that has to do with ISO or sensitivity to light, or in SCENE mode to pick what type of picture (fireworks, sunsets, etc) that you might want to use.  It can be frustrating to get to the feature you want to use.

The second frustration is the way you call up a picture youve taken by pressing a button way over in right field.  I do like the ease with which you can take movies.

The camera is somewhat heavier than Im used to so I do have to steady my hand in taking shots.   I would highly recommend it to others, especially those interested in the zoom feature.</Content>

<Content>The Canon Powershot SX101S 10MP Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Optical Image Stablilized Zoom is the kind of digital camera I always wanted.  I love the fact that you can use SD/SDHC memory cards to take the pictures so it gives you the flexibility and freedom to take the memory card and send it to photo developer for prints or you can download the software that comes with the camera to store and print your photos.  I love the fact that it has a wide angle lens and optical Image Stabilization for improved speed and great zooming.  For me, I love taking landscape shots when Im traveling and I just love  shooting a subject with landscape as a backdrop so this feature is very handy.  I also love the movie snap mode which allows me to capture high resolution still images while shooting a movie.  I also love the fact that for a very sophiticated,and technologically advanced camera it is very user friendly.  The users manual is very straightforward and easy to read and comprehend. There are so many features on the camera that makes it virtually impossible to take a bad picture and if you arent satisfied with your shot you can delete the photo from the memory card and retake the photo.  It is really fantastic and I would recomend this camera who is a novice to an avid photographer.  Im like a kid in a candy store.</Content>

<Content>Wonderful, amazing product. Superb results. You cant go wrong with this one.I am no professional, but having used a canon digital box camera earlier, this is a big switch  makes you relize that you have been living a stone age life so far. The zoom is excellent. There are few places you wont need to travel to view them, coz this powerful zoom will bring those things much closer to you. Even night results are great, although if shooting with subjects in front, you have to be cautious of the distance as too close or too far can make or break a great picture.

The only downside is the battery pack, which you need to change often. For example during our last vacation with a whole day road trip planned which included sight seeing, the batteries hardly lasted us for the whole day  if you are making movies, then itll eat it up even faster.
I would strongly suggest to carry extra batteries at all times. 

If canon can replace this for a lithium battery pack, then thatll make this unit flawless.

On the whole ill still give it 2 thumbs up  definitely suggest to others to buy.</Content>

<Content>...heavy and complicated! This camera was on my wish list for quite a long time. Its a gorgeous camera, all the features are amazing but the camera is too heavy and complicated!

It gives you a bunch of buttons and a diverse menu that you will never use. I like the camera, I have tryied many times from a friend and I decided to buy a nikon P80

Nikon is a very comfortable camera in size and features menu. All the features are in a click of a button, easy to understand and the pictures are amazing good as the cannon. Nikon is a little bit cheaper, lite, comes with averything you need if you buy from amazon. 

The big difference between this too that I really miss is that cannon has a rotate image when you turn it around and the batteries are AAA. The nikon does not turn the image ( We dont need that anyway) and the battery is rechargeble, but the amazon package comes with an extra one.

So...If you do not need professional camera, and you decide to buy one like that, I would go for NIKON P80.

I hope my enaglish is not that bad!  :o)   Good luck to you all

<Content>Ive had Canons for years. Most recently, the Rebel XT and the PowerShot 880IS. I have loved all of my Canon cameras, but this one is the best ever. The 20x optical zoom is spectacular. In shots I took of Big Sur over Christmas, the rocks on the beach are very visible and bright even at full zoom. The movie button rocks -- its convenient, and it lets you take still shots while filming video. </Content>

Only 2 small criticisms, I wish it had a lens cap attached on a tether and threads on the lens so I could add filters. </Content>

<Content>I adored my old Canon S2 IS so much that when it got dropped in the ocean there was really no question about replacing it with another Canon superzoom. I take a lot of wildlife pix, and the availability of a 560mm lens in a small, light, inexpensive package made the selection of my new SX10 IS pretty much a no-brainer. 

The trick new features like evaluative color balance and the histogram-in-viewfinder are easy and intuitive to use, but its that incredible lens that really makes the package. Its not perfect - any lens thats so compact has to have some chromatic aberration: theres purple fringing visible in high-contrast areas of the images. It all depends on how closely you look, and how picky you are. But its a fair trade, considering that the long lens allows me to capture images that I couldnt even consider with the average DSLR. Not to mention that the size, weight, and cost of DSLRs means that they stay home on most casual outings.

Go ahead and price a stabilized 500mm lens for your SLR, and after you recover from fainting, youll appreciate how much this little guy offers for the price. Amazingly, I paid exactly the same for my new SX10 IS that I did for my S2 IS several years ago.

Downsides: I miss the time-lapse feature, or Intervalometer. The package is heavier than my old S2 IS. And theres that fringing visible in outdoor shots.

Upsides: 20X, low price, fast  intuitive controls, and zero shutter lag. Its also nice to use SD cards and AA batteries.</Content>

<Content>Great product! I did a lot of research and this seemed right for me. I didnt want to step up to a DSLR yet, but didnt want a limited point and shoot.

 Pros: Zoom range, clear screens, image stabilization, two zoom speeds, tilt and swivel screen, manual controls, etc.

 Cons: The eyepiece is a bit uncomfortable, it could use some extra padding.  

Great camera for anyone who wants to learn photography with a lot of the controls of a DSLR, but the ease of use of a point and shoot.</Content>

<Content>a href=http://www.amazon.com/review/R23L3JQ0SH4U45Watch Video Here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R23L3JQ0SH4U45/a Ive had a S3IS for about 3 years.  I received my SX10IS on January 8, 2009 and I shot this video the next morning at a local park.  It was cold and windy and I was only carrying a mono pod.  I read a complaint about short battery life but it doesnt ring true for me.  Ive shot a 2.5 minute video and a 26 minute video and about 400 images in 3 outings and I still have the same NiMH AA cells in the camera.  It looks like its going to be a fun camera to carry around.  Its a bit larger but thats a plus for me. Im glad they returned to putting the memory in its own compartment because when shooting videos on a tripod its very convenient not to have to take everything apart to change memory.  The video is a bit shaky.  Its at full zoom and the fox is about 100 yards from me.  Thanks Canon for another great little camera and thanks Amazon for selling it at such a great price.  </Content>

<Content>Let me start off by saying, the last time I bought a digital camera 3.1MP and 3X Optical Zoom is what you got for the same price as the SX10 IS.  Im still learning myself, since I bought my previous camera I was just describing over 7 years ago, so Im by no means an expert or any authority.  Im still getting used to this camera.  When I first bought this camera, I never even heard of shutter priority, apertures, white balance, ISO speeds etc.  It all seemed overwhelming really, almost made the camera seem too complicated to use on anything other than Auto.  But I read up on that stuff, and quickly understood it.  Once that happened, putting it all into practice was easy.  

I finally decided it was time to upgrade, and on paper the SX10 IS looked like it would last me quite a while with all the features it offers.  

This is a LARGE, heavy, DSL like point and shoot, with all the mode and options youd find in the lower end DSLRs like the Nikon D40 etc.  I was able to figure out the basic operation just by playing with it, but the manual is helpful.  I STRONGLY urge you to read the manual.  

I just have to mention the Face Detection.  Playing around with the camera the day I received it, I was pointing it at the TV while watch Law and Order or something like that.  And wouldnt you know it the Face Detection was going nuts.  Every persons face who was on that TV screen, no matter how brief, no matter if it was one face or 3-4 faces, the camera detected their faces and put a white bracket around it.  

Macro, and Especially Super Macro mode are amazing.  This was one of the things that drew me to this camera.  Being able to put suck a sharp focus on something so close it could be touching the lens is amazing.

Like I said previously, before I got this camera I knew nothing about shutter priority, apertures, white balance, ISO speeds and all that.  With that said, after about a week of owning this camera I take almost all my pictures on either Auto, or Full Manual (50/50).  Its just great to be able to fine tune your pictures before you take them.  One of the other things I was worried about when buying a camera is having to rely on software to make the pictures look the way I wanted after transferring them to my PC.  With full manual control, edits like that are almost unnecessary.  

A word about the wheel.  I guess to some this is a departure from the conventional type of digital camera controls theyre used to.  Ive never owned a camera like this and with no prior experience I cant really comment on that.  I can comment on the wheel though.  It is a little tough to use, takes anywhere from a 1/4 to 1/2 a turn, probably even more, just to get it to respond.  I suppose that delay in response was probably to prevent setting changes if you accidentally touch the wheel or something.  Either way, it takes some getting used to using.

Also, after having this camera for just a week, I have to say I dont know what Id do with another camera that didnt have the swivel LCD screen.  Its one of those things that you never knew you needed, until you have it and you wonder how other people get by without it.  Definitely handy for macro shots and when using the camera at weird angels.

<Content>I have been carrying around two cameras since each one had its strengths and wanted to be down to one camera that did it all.  After careful study I picked up the SX10 IS and cant be more happy.  It is fast and has image stabilization so it can replace my Canon A710 IS in most cases, unless small camera size is important.  It is 10MP,has a 20X zoom, fast flash recycle times and a nice sunset mode, so it replaces my older Nikon Coolpix 8700 and exceeds its specs.  Last evening I went to a concert and by setting the ISO3200 Scene mode I was able to get usable photos without flash from the back of the room at full zoom.  Yes, the colors were sometimes washed out and the size was down to 1600x1200, but faces came out well and the photos looked fairly good.  This camera keeps surprising me and I am very happy to have it.</Content>

<Content>Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized ZoomThis camera showed itself to be hardy, reasonably weather resistant, capable of numerous actions that I never used before.  It does not take BW, but changes a color shot into BW.  20x is a little far for it, or for me to keep it really stable.  Fine for views, but not as good for birds, which turn out to be fuzzy at that distance. It worked hard for me and did an excellent job within my parameters.  I would recommend it for any sincere but not into changing lenses photographer. It does not collect dust inside!  I am still learning all the things it can do (have had it for a month). </Content>

<Content>We purchased this camera to update our existing Canon S2IS just before our first trip to Israel. Overall, this camera was excellent and consistently took great pictures. I shot about 1,300 pictures, some under very challenging conistions. The menus and operation were somewhat similar to our old S2IS so there was very little learning curve.

Modes used: I shot most pictures using the P mode which allows some manual settings such as ISO, white balance, flash strength, and exposure adjustment. The remainder I shot in manual mode.

What I liked: The old S2IS often took a long time to lock focus. This camera focuses very quickly allowing me to get a lot of just now shots. The image stabilizer, like the one in the S2IS was phenominal. With still subjects, I could consistently get clean, well focused shots at 1/8 second, and I have a slight hand tremor. Sometimes I could get good shots at slower shutter speeds. This really helped indoors where flashes were not permitted, or the subjects were distant. It also helped a lot at night. Another huge feature is the range of the lens. It goes from slightly telephoto at 28mm to 560 mm (20X zoom). I was able to get shots of things I could hardly see with my naked eye. I was also able to get close ups at great distance. Many of my best shots were at high zoom. With dslrs you often have to change lenses and these shots would have been missed. The manual settings were generally easy to use and really expanded the pictures we could shoot. Generally, I used shutter priority. I really liked the electronic viewfinder. It saves battery power and accurately shows how a shot will be exposed. It also has a diopter adjustment. The flip out and twist tilt screen was also a help with crowd shots. The flash was strong and can be enhanced.  In addition, there is a hot shoe for an add on flash. I did not have an add on flash, but I can see how it would be useful in lower light conditions. I discovered there is a mute button on the top left that suppresses all noise. This is handy when you cant be obtrusive. To turn sounds back on, you have to go into the menu. Battery life was also very good. I used rechargable nmh batteries that when fully charged would handle the almost 200 shots per day without indicating much use on the battery level indicator. Overall the camera provided well focused and well exposed shots in a variety of conditions, with plenty of adjustments and clever features.

What could be better: Occasionally the autofocus would be fooled in low light or with objects intervening between me and the subject. I would revert to the manual focus mode, but it was a little awkward to use. In shutter priority mode, you spin a wheel on the back of the camera to adjust shutter speed. The change in shutter speed did not respond predictably to my thumbing of the wheel. Not a major problem, but I noticed it. In cloudy lighting (much of our trip in December) some shots were a bit overexposed in P mode inducing me to use shutter priority. To be fair the shots would often consist of brighter sky, and darker buildings. The camera does have several exposure algorithms to choose, but I stayed with the default. And since this is a point and shoot, and not a dslr, shooting at higher ISOs resulted in somewhat grainy pictures. The highest ISO I used was 800, sometimes at night and sometimes in caves so the noise was not all that relevant to the picture quality.

I gave the camera 4 stars because it was excellent, but not perfect.</Content>

<Content>This upgrade from S3IS and S5IS has some very good improvements, but also some degraded features. I took the picture at full optical zoom with an S3IS and SX10IS and compared them side by side. Of course the SX10 will show more details because of more zoom and more pixels, but there is more noise, so the enhencement is worth only about a third of what the number should make you expect :20X and 10 Mpixel.
Movie is very grainy in moderate and low light.
I returned the camera and bought another S3IS (mine had been stolen).
Three stars, because other similar cameras seem to be with defects also.
It is like choosing a car, technically a car with have it all should be available at a reasonable price - it is just marketing so you keep searching and buying. Just like XP - Vista - WIndows 7 ...</Content>

<Content>I couldnt make up my mind what type of camera I wanted to purchase; an SLR or a point and shoot. I knew what features I wanted, but up until recently I couldnt find a camera fitting all my needs. I decided that for my purposes of taking travel pictures I wanted something easy to use, but an upgrade to my present camera, a Canon PowerShot A610. I really liked the shape of the camera, which is easy to hold with one hand. Then one of the best features was vari-angle LCD. After searching different cameras I was thrilled when I found the SX10IS which had most if not all the features I had been looking for. I wanted at least 18x optical zoom and this has 20x; I definitely wanted the vari-angle LCD for taking pictures either higher or lower than a comfortable viewing level. (It sure saves on backs when wanting to take a close up of a flower and you can turn the viewer up and hold the camera down at arms length to get a great picture). It also has the easy grip like my older camera, however I find there are more buttons that I sometimes push inadvertantly, and get out of the mode that I want to be in. As I get more used to the camera I dont mess up as often. The pictures come out crystal clear and I can zoom in when viewing on my computer and still get great pixel clarity. The finished photos I have had processed have come out close to studio quality. Recently I took portraits of guests at our Christmas party and had rave reviews of the finished product with many ordering additional prints to send to family and friends. Also, I was extremely pleased when taking photos at the Tournament of Roses parade last week. 

Most electonic gadgets have more features on them then one will ever use, and this camera is no exception. Slowly, I am trying to learn more to take advantage of more features. On the other hand, if you want ease of use then with this camera you can be out taking pictures as soon as you put in your batteries and memory card. Speaking of memory cards, you will want to buy a high speed card to take advantage of the continuous shoot feature. This is great when taking pictures of moving objects. Another feature I havent mentioned is the great video (with sound) that you can take with this camera. Having a high capacity memory SD card helps. I always carry extra cards, but with my new 8 GB card I wont be using the extra cards very often. 

Face recognition is another feature I havent used before.  It is an interesting feature and new tool when taking group shots.  

I could go on and on, there are so many good things I could say about this camera.  I really dont have any negatives other than accidentally pushing buttons when I dont want to.  As I had read in another review, the controls are touchy and you have to be aware of where your fat fingers land.

Im a senior citizen who loves to take pictures and have thousands of photos on my computer. I enjoy viewing slide shows of all the pictures of our travels throughout the USA and also abroad. If you want to take a step up from the compact point and shoot then I would highly recommend the Canon PowerShot SX10IS. It has features you will appreciate for taking photos both indoors and out. </Content>

<Content>I used the Canon SX10is daily over a period of two months on a trip to Peru, and shot around 600 images during that time.  I would call this normal use.  The LCD monitor on my camera appears to have an anti-reflective coating which resists fingerprints.  The coating on the LCD monitor on my camera wore through in less than two months of normal use, and it scratched easily.  The paint on the function set button on the back of the camera also wore off in less than two months, which I considered an unacceptably short time.  This is not covered by the Canon warranty, according to Canon customer service.  I had expected better durability.  If you buy this camera and intend to have it hanging around your neck and brushing against your shirt, be sure to buy a plastic screen protector to protect the screen, or else turn the vari-angle screen inwards anytime youre not shooting.  I dont know what to say about the paint on the buttons wearing off, so Ill just mention that it happened on mine and recommend that Canon use a more durable paint in the future.  Otherwise the camera performed about as expected, although it went through AA batteries very quickly.  If you buy this camera, also buy 8 rechargeable AA batteries and a rapid charger, and carry 4 spare batteries with you if you anticipate a full day of shooting.</Content>

<Content>I got the Canon SX10 because it seemed to be better than the Nikon P80.  But when I brought it home, it frustrated me that I couldnt zoom in and focus on someones eye while 5 feet away.  (the P80 couldnt either)  I also didnt think it did great in poor lighting without the flash.  The files were a bit grainy, and sometimes it didnt focus.

So I returned it and got the Nikon P80.  I fell in love with it because of the ease of use, the manual was so easy to understand, everything seemed wonderful.  But when I compared the pictures side by side with the Canon pictures, Canon came out ahead.  I took pictures with both cameras of the same things, at the same times and settings.  The Canon images were more true to color, they were clearer, and flash didnt dominate or change the lighting.  It performed better in almost everything, and its a much more solid feeling camera.

THE VIDEO AND SOUND QUALITY WERE MILES APART!!  The Nikon video was very grainy and not too focused.  When I played it back on my computer, the mono sound was so hollow.  But the Canon video was so clear I could see my reflection in my daughters eye!  And the sound is truly in stereo!  There is NO comparison.  You can even take still pics while doing a video with the Canon, but not with the Nikon.

Nikon is definitely better at taking sharp, clear images in poor lighting.  But in the zoom, Canon is slightly ahead.

I dont really like the design of the Canon, specifically the location of the three buttons where my thumb likes to hold the camera.  One of them is the DELETE button!  I keep accidently pressing those buttons!  They should not be there.  There should be a rubber grip like on the Nikon, and nothing else.

Also, I like the lens cap better on the Nikon than on the Canon, but for the quality of the pics and especially the video and stereo sound, who cares about the cap!

Well, I went back to the store and asked for my Canon.  They still had it in the same place when I had returned it the day before.  Im loving it now.  I will learn to grip my camera wider so that I dont hit the buttons, and I will zoom out just a bit to get that perfect shot.

There is yet another thing.  When I looked at the details for the files, the Nikon ones recorded at 300 dpi, and the Canon ones were only at 180 dpi.  So I dont know whats going on there.  They were both set at the highest, largest, superfine settings.  Oh well.  I still think the Canon SX10 performs better than the Nikon P80.</Content>

<Content>Contrary to other reviews, you can put a 52mm UV or polarizer lightweight lens on the end of the zoom They fit, I have done this with mine. 
t takes great pictures and I bought it as a upgrade to the Cannon S5 IS (that you have to use converter lenses to attain what this SX10 IS already has built into it). The only carry over that I can use from my Canon S5 IS, with the SX10 IS, is the Speedlite 430 flash for the external hot shoe. The manual and other reviews state that no lenses can be attached. They are wrong!!! I have numerous step up and step down rings from my other cameras and lo and behold, found that the end of the SX10 IS can take a 52mm ring or in other words a 52mm polarizer or uv lens etc. can be attached to it. This is true because I now can attach them to mine. Also, I do not like the lens cap that came with it., even though it can be attached to the strap. I had another cap from another camera that was a 52mm with a cord that was attached to it and I put this cap on my new camera instead. Just Google 52mm lens cap with a string and you can purchase one for under 4 dollars. I also use 8gb or larger SD cards and the new 2900 MIH rechargeable batteries (nothing lower than 2900) that last all day. This is the camera that I will be using for a long time. It has everything built into it with no need to carry additional heavy lenses. I highly endorse it. The flip out lcd is another plus. </Content>

<Content>I bought this for my wife who was frustrated with the quality of pictures of our old point and shoot camera.  She wanted something that could take good pics of the kids for her scrap booking projects.  Of course Im thinking SLR, but she needs something that is simple to use. After reading all the reviews, this camera undoubtedly takes top honors.  

The 20X tele-zoom and auto focus makes portrait pictures of the kids easy and they turn out awesome.  

After using the camera for 2 weeks, Ive noticed the tunneling on some modes.  Im not sure if this is caused by the lens shade, but its no big deal if you crop your pics.  Also, my thumb always seems to hit the selection dial on the back.  Finally, the lens cover should be attached to a lanyard on the camera.  Ive misplaced it twice, but luckily found it.  Im certain the third time, I wont be so lucky.    </Content>

<Content>My dad has resisted updating his digital camera for several years.  I finally convinced him this year and this was the camera I chose for his Christmas gift.

It is simply outstanding.  The camera is full featured and offers all of the controls that the DSLRs have when it comes to aperture and shutter speed settings and manual controls.  But the real test is how it shoots in full auto, because that is when the camera has to make critical decisions.

This camera succeeds wildly.  We were at a Christmas party and I had my Canon 30D DSLR in full manual mode with a 550EXII flash mounted and my dad had his new Canon Powershot SX10IS.  When we got home we compared pictures and he fared very well against my shots.

The flash is surprisingly strong, but doesnt wash out close shots.  It can light up a big room from far away.  The focus is good and fast.  The colors are OUTSTANDING and the 20x zoom and 28mm wide angle are features that offer the best of both worlds when it comes to handling a variety of situations.

On top of that, the Image Stabilization works very well and makes the 20x zoom usable.

Plus, my dad has now retired his old video camera as well since you can get image stabilized, 20x zoomable, 640x480 stereo video at the press of a button.  This camera is really the best featured and easy to use camera out there and at a price that is unbeatable.  Add an inexpensive 8Gb memory card and a set of four rechargable AA batteries and you are in at under $400 for everything you need.

I highly recommend this camera as the best ALL-AROUND camera you can buy right now when you consider price, features, size and image quality.</Content>

<Content>I owned and loved my PowerShot S3 IS for several years.  The S3 IS was a great camera and I really enjoyed it - that is I *liked* using it.  I enjoyed taking pictures with it.  It was a great camera.

Then I sold it to a friend and upgraded to this SX10 IS.  Frankly, I generally regret parting with my venerable S3 IS.

In comparison:
*  The S3 IS was smaller.  Physically, if you measure, the ruler says that the SX10 is not that much bigger -- but the feel of the SX10 is heavy and clunky.
*  The controls of the S3 were much easier to manipulate by touch (i.e. Im looking thought the eye-piece and changing settings by feel) -- this SX10 seems much more difficult to do the same thing, I and find I have to look at the controls more.
*  The lens cap on the S3 IS was tethered - attached - and I could flip it off with the flick of one finger and know Im not going to lose.  Whereas, the lens cap of the SX10 is NOT tethered and attaches differently making it hugely inconvenient for the quick-shot you might try to capture.  In my experience, more often than not, the lens cap falls off as Im taking the camera out of my camera bag and is prone to fly off and get lost.  VERY annoying.  My intension is to attach a thin string somehow.
*  Frankly, I see almost NO difference in the Digic III processor in this SX10 than I did in the Digic II processor of the S3 IS.  IF the SX10 dropped fewer frames when snapping a pic during movie mode, that would be great - but I see no difference.

There are many other small annoyances between the S3 and the SX10 that I wont belabor here.

On the plus side, I will admit that the 20x Zoom is nice.

Summary:
IF you are contemplating upgrading from an S3 IS or an S5 IS, my advice is to give this one a pass and keep your current camera UNLESS you really want the 20x zoom.</Content>

<Content>Ive been using the PowerShot A710IS for more than a year now and come to love this package for the workhorse service it has unfailingly provided. When I read about the SX10IS, I jumped at the chance to upgrade at an incredibly affordable price. I didnt look around too much -- Im brand faithful and would go Canon anytime. 

There are so many detailed reviews here that I would never hope to match them. As an avid amateur though, and after using the camera for about three weeks, I have only praise for it. 

Ive shot hundreds of pictures, indoors and outdoors. I experimented with shooting video. The results were always more than five-star in my book. The camera feels positive and points naturally. Yes, it is on the heavier side, but the strap does a good job of helping you carry it with no problems. Minor complaints are the absence of thread to allow using filters and the annoying little plasticky cover of the USB hookup. However, the filter problem should be solved soon: check out this site [...]  And dont underestimate the GREAT practicality of the SX10IS running on 4 AA batteries -- no proprietary rechargeable, AC adapters, and all such to lug around. Just buy batteries at the drugstore or, better, get a couple of sets of AA rechargeables with your own little charger and youre on, no sweat and tears. 

This is a super package at an unbeatable price. And it carries Canon quality. Statistically, you cant go wrong.

<Content>The Canon SX10 IS is a very impressive superzoom camera.
The ergonomics of the SX10 are excellent.  The camera feel substantial but not overly heavy in the hand, and the fingers wrap around the grip very naturally and securely, leaving thumb and fingers well position for the controls.  The menus seem very intuitive to me - almost all the settings are where I expect to find them.  (This may be partly because I have owned several A-series cameras and know the Canon menus system, but I recall thinking with my first A-series camera that the menu distribution made a lot of sense.)  The menu settings include a customizable menu list that can be set to include the users most frequently accessed menu items, edited to the order of the owners choosing, and, if desired, set to be the default menu on initial access of the menu functions - overall a means of truly customizing the camera to ones own particular needs and uses.  Many users will join me in applauding the presence of focal-length markings on the lens barrel - a nice feature that means a lot to more experienced photographers but is notably lacking on the models of most other manufacturers.
The range of capabilities of this camera is remarkable.   Begin with the lens:  28 to 560 mm equivalent in 35-mm terms.  This means that, from about 12 feet away, I could on Christmas morning make one exposure that encompassed the room, all the decorations, and the days several celebrants, and without moving, fill the frame with a single ornament on the tree on the other side of the room.  Both are remarkable in their own way.  One of the things I have missed in moving to compact digital cameras from high-end 35mm cameras was a seriously wide angle lens.  A 28 mm lens gets a lot of wear and tear in the kit of a serious 35mm shooter, begin used both indoors and out to capture wide expanses.  Having a 28 mm short end of a zoom is vastly different than calling 35 mm wide angle.  On the other end of the scale, 560 mm is a lot of lens, and one would seldom attempt to hand-hold that much lens with a conventional 35 mm system.  Image stabilization, however, allows sharp shots hand-held with the long lens.  Image stabilization is said to allow a gain of 2 stops in exposure latitude.  The usual rule of thumb is to reach for a tripod whenever your shutter speed is slower than the inverse of your lens length (i.e., 1/30 sec for a 28 mm lens, 1/60 for a normal 50 to 55 mm lens, 1/250 for the long end of an ordinary zoom in the 210 to 270 mm range.  With practice, photographers can often beat that rule by one stop, but with IS I have beaten the rule by 3 to 4 stops with tack-sharp results.
The reason that Canon digitals attract a lot of gray-haired photographers with extensive 35-mm experience is because most of their cameras have easy access to shutter- and aperture-priority modes and a fully manual mode in addition to the several programmed modes on the dial.  There are times when us old geezers look at a prospective shot, identify potential exposure problems, and solve them by selecting a specific shutter speed or aperture value, or sometimes both.  Such settings remain easy to access and manipulate with the SX10, and the other specialized program sets are well-conceived, if rather standard, and equally easy to access with the control dial.  The control dial also has a setting that can be customized to give quick control-dial access to a set of features and settings that the owner anticipates using frequently - thank you, Canon, for recognizing that your customers have brains of their own.
The software has some pretty gee-whiz features.  Face detection seems to work very well, and the camera can pick out all the faces in a frame and it allows you to select one to be highest priority in focus and exposure.  Even more remarkable is a delayed exposure option that counts the faces in the frame when the shutter button is pressed, then recognizes when a new face (the photographers) shows up, and fires two seconds later.  I am not sure how often it will be used, but the very capability is a remarkable bit of intelligence to be present in a camera.  Focusing can be set to face-detection or a defined-zone system that starts with a central square and can be shifted by the photographer.  Exposure options include evaluative, full-frame center-weighted, or spot metering, and the spot meter can be linked to the focus frame.  The focus frame can be blown up either prior to shooting or in review to check focus.  (I found this feature to be a bit distracting to composition, so I turned it off in the menus but I can imagine situations in which I might reactivate it.)  Auto focus can be set to continuous or shutter-button activated; servo focus off or on.  The flash is activated to raising or lower it; auto and forced flash is available; a red-eye lamp is pretty ineffective and can be turned off, as can the focus-assist beam; flash can be synced to first or second curtain.  Stitch assist includes not only the usual left-to-right and right-to-left options, but also top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, and a four-shot two-dimensional rectangle.  I can go on about the settings, but the reader can access that information by reading the owners manual at the Canon website.  The key point is versatility - you can set and override darn near everything on this camera.
Picture quality is quite good.  Ten megapixels is a lot to cram onto a small sensor, and some folks have reported some chromic aberration, or purple fringing.  Chromic aberration is worst at sharp edges of high contrast.  I have made deliberate attempts to produce chromic aberrations, and have been inconsistently successful, having produced the dreaded purple fringe only on some shots, and visible only after extensive enlargement.  I have not yet had a picture that I thought was significantly affected by chromic aberration when viewed at a reasonable magnification.
So is the SX10 a perfect camera?  No, but it is awfully good; its capabilities rival the best 35 mm cameras in many ways, and its digital capabilities allow it to offer features impossible with 35 mm cameras, like stitch assist, creative color options, and contrast controls.  I would love for it to have  larger sensor, but we all know that the manufacturers are going to protect their D-SLR lines, and the technical aspects of designing lenses small enough for a compact camera that still serve larger sensors are said to be quite formidable.  A wider range of aperture settings would be nice - I am sure that everyone would like a little more speed, and that would allow further narrowing of the depth of field for portraiture, but my appeal would be for another stop or two on the smaller side, so that the 28-mm setting can be used with knowledge of depth of field for foreground-to-infinity sharpness in landscape works.  (Few people realize these days that Ansel Adams worked mostly with f-stops of 64!)  But, all of you old 35 mm devotees out there please admit it - if you were ever crazy enough to dream of a 28-560 zoom with this good of an optical quality, you would have killed to own one, and you would have expected to mortgage your house to be able to afford it.
So overall - extreme versatility in hardware and software, very good image quality, and a highly user-friendly design make the SX10 difficult to exceed in a single-lens camera.  Multiple lenses and a larger D-SLR body add some image quality and perhaps some additional capabilities, but the additional abilities will be quite esoteric for most users, and the difference in image quality will seldom be justified by the expense and, more important on most days, the extra bulk and weight of a multi-lens system.  The SX10 should receive serious consideration from anyone desiring a high quality digital camera but reluctant invest in a D-SLR system.

<Content>After having never owned anything other than a point and shoot digital, I decided to upgrade.  I received my camera a few days after Thanksgiving and have really enjoyed its options and possibilities.  Although Ive had some foopaas, which was not the equipment, but the operator, Ive gotten mostly positive results.  Of course, Im still learning and practicing.  
The zoom power is what I was looking for - its great. I find the handling of the camera comfortable and easy.  I have been using a tripod for some shots which gives it great stability for portraits and nature shots.  I took it to a Hank Williams concert and only got blurs.  I think I need a bit more practice and understanding of the operation of this camera.  If you are just stepping up to a better quality camera with more possibilities than a point and shoot, I recommend this one.</Content>

<Content>This camera is the latest in the PowerShot S model line.  As one of the first buyers of an S3 - I fell in love with my S3.  BUT today my love has soured, after 2 1/2 years I got a lens error message and the lens keeps moving in and out until I shut it off.  A quick internet search will show you that this is a common problem.  My camera has never been abused, dropped, or used in sand. Since, my camera is out of warranty it will cost $150 to fix (provided it does not need additional parts) - roughly a 1/3 of the price of this camera.  None of the suggested fixes from the various websites corrected the problem.  I still like the camera but had to resort to my trusty AE-1 film camera for holiday photos!  Ill probably get it fixed but my word of warning is that since this camera is in the same family of Canon digitals - you might want to consider an extended warranty.</Content>

<Content>I recently upgraded from an S3 IS to the SX10 IS. Canono has made a lot of improvements (more optical zoom, better display with more information, higher ISO, higher pixels, better face detection). The list is quite long and I must say that some additions really add value to the camera and improve the perforamnce. I wont  go into too much details as they have been amply covered by other reviewers.
The pictures are generally sharp outdoors and are comparable to other point and shoot cameras with super zoom. Without being too technical, I can say that the cameras value for money is very good in its own class.

My only complain is the low light performance, especially the video. I tested the camera indoors during a school concert and I was surprised to find that the camera struggled to keep the subject in focus during video recording. I have never experienced that with the S3 or the S2 that i owned previously. Moreover, still pictures taken in low lights also are affected by the cameras weak autofocusing. I was prepared to live with the conversion from the AVI to the MOV format but the low light performance is really a turn off for me.
A major strength of the IS series was the excellent movie mode with zoom and stereo sound and I did not feel the need to carry my camcorder for recording movies.  
If you own an S3 or an S5, I would recommend not upgrading rt now. I am on the verge of returning the camera after christmas primarily to the Poor low light performance. 

Update (12/27/2008)
Returned the camera today. Extensively tested the low light perofrmance and flash results but its not worth spending 400 bucks for such a performance. Am seriously considering the XSi DSLR as my next camera.  </Content>

This is a good camera to have just in case you want to take a small light camera instead of a big camera with a heavy lens on it, will still take the great close-up pictures.</Content>

<Content>I am very happy with this camera.  I was looking to replace/upgrade my Canon SD600 and significantly increase the zooming capability without getting back into the SLR realm.  My current photography requirements call for a flexible point  shoot camera, and I did not want the bulk of another SLR system.  This camera fulfills my needs perfectly.  Although its too large to fit in my pocket, the SLR-like capabilities it comes with make up for the larger form factor.  Several friends who are new digital SLR owners were all impressed with the SX10s zoom range.

I have shot almost 900 pictures in the four weeks Ive had the SX10, but am still learning many of its controls and capabilities.  Ive discarded about 5% of the shot Ive taken due mainly to poor exposure or focus, but have learned how to aim the focusing points and exposure metering properly to eliminate those problems.

My previous cameras were: Nikon FM2, Canon RebelG (35mm), Canon A70, Canon A75, and Canon SD600.  The SX10 reminds me of the RebelG in terms of flexibility and ease of use.

I like Canons use of AA batteries and SDHC memory cards, both of which are inexpensive and readily available. I was able to get a pair of Sandisk 8gb Extreme II and 3 Sandisk 4gb Extreme III SDHC cards for under $25 each during Black Friday sales, which should be more than sufficient for any future trips I take.

I would strongly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a feature-packed point  shoot that is willing to sacrifice camera size for capability.

<Content>I want to preface and say that I am not a professional photographer, but an amateur amateur photographer.  I like to take quality pictures without having to go thru alot of hassle.  My previous camera was a Kodak Easyshare C875, which is a great camera and allowed me to take some pretty awesome shots...but I knew i was ready for more.  I take my friends kids pictures in every season...again, its really just for practice for me, and she reaps the benefit.  

So I do my homework and read reviews on this camera, and pretty much everyone who uses it likes it.  I get it in my hands finally and i LOVE the way it feels....it is a little bulky, but I like the weight in my hands.  I love the swing out LCD screen, which also doubles as a protective measure for it too.  The pictures I have taken so far with this camera have been of amazing quality, and print out fantastic.  I like that this camera is great for people of all abilities too....as I learn more about photography, I can do more with the camera.  But someone could even point and click with this camera too.  I cant wait to be able to get more out of this camera.   I love it!</Content>

<Content>Very nice camera... This is the best PS camera I have used so far.
Pros: Very good picture quality.
Picture quality is still amazing when fully zoomed. 
Does very well with moving objects.
I have not had a single picture with Red Eye yet.

Cons: No camera bag! 
Lens cap is a snap on that isnt connected to the camera making it very easy to lose.
Camera sometimes takes a little bit too long to focus and snap shots. 

Overall I feel this was a great buy and would buy it again in a second. As stated above, the picture qaulity is amazing and must be printed to see. If you dont want to break into the DSLR catagory then this is a very nice alternative at the top of the Point and Shot lines.</Content>

<Content>It is awesome!!!  All I can say is zoom zoom baby.  You can get any picture anywhere no matter how far.  It is amazing.  The zoom works really well and with the stability thing I think the pictures come out great for its class.  This is no DSLR dont think it is.  But for its class this is worth it. 

You also can get amazing close up group shots with the 28mm wide angle built in.  All I can say is I will never ever buy a camera without that wide angle again.  It is perfect.  

It is a bit bulky but worth it for the crispy zoomed pictures you get.  And you get use to the bulk and the grip and I have small hands so no problem.  It is probably bigger than you are use to, this is not ELPH.  But with the 20x...

It runs on double AAs but if you get some nice rechargeable they should last you long while.  I was on a recent trip in Peru and used some sanyo batteries and they lasted for 3 days of continuous picture taking.  

the one annoying thing is no lens cap tether! but you can buy one for a buck and do that yourself.  

one of the best things is the flip out LCD it helps you take really hard to angle shots.  

I found the wheel a little annoying and I had to use the book a lot when I was trying to figure other controls in the beginning, but if you want to just up and go with the camera you use the auto functions and get great pictures.  

So picture takers who want ZOOM take this camera and go!!!!!

<Content>I love my new camera for all the same reasons other reviewers have mentioned.  My one squabble is that it does not come with a memory card!!  I was shocked!  (Probably shouldve read the whats in the box print more closely.)  I simply assumed that for the price Id also get at least a small card.  I feel a bit nickled and dimed.  So learn from my mistake.... buy a card along with your camera so you really can use it right out of the box.  Oh, yes, get some rechargeable NiMH batteries, too.  Youll go broke buying alkalines.  All things said, I still love my camera and would buy it again in a heartbeat.</Content>

<Content>This camera is super! Couldnt be happier. It is metal not plastic which is a personal preference to me, seems more solid. Takes nice photos and is easy to use, easy to move the photos on to my PC. It is my second digital, I actually wore out my first one (I have small kids) and this one seems pretty tough. The only thing I have at all to say that is negative is that the lens cap does not have a cord which attaches it permanantly to the camera. I will lose the cap. My Kodak digital just had a little string so the cap could not get lost. 
I researched this for weeks and this camera is probably the best digital camera you can buy before going to the type of digital that you have to change the lenses around. 
This is a very nice camera.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this product to upgrade from a simple Point and Shoot. I read about the comparisons between this and another camera in the same range; however, if you are adjusting from a beginner point and shoot to not exactly a DSLR, this IS the camera for you.

I ordered this for Thanksgiving, and read a quick lesson in the book about how to get some of the features running.  Not a single shot has disappointed me.  Granted, I am not a professional camera person, nor do I intend on going into details about pixels. 

All I wanted to know is: Does it produce good images?  Answer: For Sure!  Does it produce good PRINTED images?  Answer: I printed 8x10, 5x7, and 4x6 and all of them come out excellent.  

I have an niece that is only 18 months (just walking) and this camera took phenomenal pictures of her.  I have had this camera a little over 2 weeks and it has yet to disappoint me.  It is great to find a good camera and that has the LCD screen that rotates!

It comes Highly recommended </Content>

<Content>Have not had this camera very long but know that I will like it.  Love the zoom lens.  Photos with the tele-converter are clearer than with a digital zoom, so the actual length of lens available is more than 560mm.  Clips in movie mode have been clear and of good quality (30fps).  It more difficult to set the scene options than on other canon cameras, but think this will get easier with practice.  At the widest angle of the lens (28mm) the lens hood gets into the picture so it has to be removed before shooting.</Content>

<Content>I have had the Canon s10 for less than 24 hours, so these are my first impressions. I will update later. Assuming you have read other reviews, let me add some different information. Specific points.
1. Comments about the lens cap are absolutely true; it is awkward and does not fit easily.  You wind up dropping it frequently and sticking your fingers on the lens. This is not good.
2. After inserting the 4 AA batteries, it is very hard getting the cover correctly shut.  I am guessing that it will break easily, if that task is not done very carefully.
3. The feel of the camera is great; it fits my older arthritic bulky hands very well.
4. I didnt know until I read part of the instruction manual, that the camera has a control that allows you to vary the loudness of separate functions of the camera; shutter, turning on, menu opening, etc...  PLUS, there is a button on the top left of the camera that enables you to MUTE ALL sounds of the camera if you press it as you are turning the camera on.  I think this sound adjustment feature is very handy, although my poor ears have difficulty hearing anything...
5. The pictures I have taken have been very good and sharp for me.  I was coming from an older Panasonic point and shoot.
6. I am really, really having to read the manual to learn all the different capabilities.  If you get this camera, plan on spending some real time with the manual.  For example, it is not intuitively obvious how one changes the size of the desired image from 10 to 1 megapixel.  It took real manual reading to figure that out.
7. Despite my nit-picks, I am loving this camera. It is absolutely doing what I wanted.  Namely giving me some really good manual and varied functions in a premium point and shoot without the expense of a DSLR. 

My plan, if I continue to use this and enjoy photography, then I will upgrade to a DSLR, but right now, I have lots to learn, and enjoy with the Canon S10.
Nick

UPDATE: 16 Dec 2008
Still love the camera, but still learning.  You MUST read the User Manual, and study it, in combination with playing with the camera.  Good way to spend a couple of hours at Star$$s.  The manual tells you specifically how to make certain changes in settings; however, it does NOT tell you when or why to make the changes.  You need to study it and THINK.  If you want a camera just to take simple, quick snapshots, this camera will do it, but that would be wasting this cameras terrific abilities. Spend a lot less and get a regular Canon or Sony PS.

If you want a camera to learn how to do manual settings, like aperture and shutter priority settings, and others, WITHOUT spending the big $$$s needed to buy a DSLR, then this is the perfect camera for that.
Specific points:
1. The built in flash is not very strong at all.  I will need to get a Canon external flash, probably the 430ex model, to make it as strong as I would like.  
2. Figuring out how to change the image size, from 10 M to 8 or even down to less than 1 M for a 640x480 pixel photo is NOT intuitively obvious.  You have to read the manual and learn that it is necessary to push the Function button while the camera is in take photo mode and then look down the list of items and choose from: 10M, 8M, etc...
3. The lens for this camera isnt the worlds greatest.  When it is dark it will only open up to 4.0 and that just isnt fast enough; then with a low power flash, your low light shooting is compromised yielding noisy/unsharp  images.
4. I havent found a camera bag that suits my taste for this camera yet; still looking.  I want something that will carry the camera, an external flash, a spare set of batteries, and little nit-bits.  I am sure they exist, just havent found the right one.  But then, searching for photography stuff is always fun...  I AM loving the camera, but would still leave the rating at four stars.

<Content>This class of camera came about in order to satisfy the dreams of those who would have a digital SLR... IF they could afford it and the lenses theyd like.

The image quality of the Canon SX10IS is pretty good but you always give up some image quality to gain such a large zoom range so there is a small bit of chromatic aberration, purple fringing, in the extreme zoom ranges.

The one thing that I do miss is a remote shutter release, I like to do night photography. The 2 second self-timer setting helps a bit to overcome this oversight. Also the operating temperature range is a bit limited, 32 degrees F. Anyone who likes to take winter photos may have to keep the camera under cover, against their bodies when not shooting. I havent tried it in below freezing temperatures yet so I dont know the practical limitations as yet.

If even this price range is too much Id strongly suggest the Fujifilm Finepix S1000fd at less then half the price. It has most of the features though less zoom and no external flash hotshoe. I bought the Fuji as an early Christmas present for my girlfriend and shes quite enjoying it.

March 9, 2009 UPDATE:
This has been a very good consumer camera but there are two things that bug me about it so far.

The first is that the Command Dial (I think thats what they call it) is not very responsive at all. Youll see other people complain about it as well. If you are using the dial to make exposure adjustments or if you are selecting Scene settings then jerk the dial in 1/4 turn increments. Simply using a smooth dialing motion wont work. Secondly, it really sucks for manually focusing! It is really hard to manually focus this camera. *so sad*

Secondly... because this is a consumer level camera the CCD sensor, the chip that senses the light in place of film, is a smaller sensor then pro or semi-pro cameras. This has the very sad side effect of creating digital noise. This is the equivalent of higher ASA/ISO film having more grain and in some ways is to be expected BUT if you can afford one of the higher priced DSLR cameras then Id go for that as the larger sensors have less digital noise.

If you want to get a little better image out of this smaller sensor try using the dust and scratch removal settings in your photo editing software. Try a 2 pixel setting first.

Overall it is still a great camera. If you move up to a DSLR later then keep it as a backup.</Content>

<Content>I was lured to the SX10 after 3 years of great satisfaction with the Canon SX2 IS.  Many of my photos are taken indoors at church events.  I prefer to avoid flash so that I can be as inconspicuous as possible, but occasionally I require it.  With ISO 1600 capability and a hot shoe for external flash, the SX10 fits the bill.

Canon made all the right tradeoffs for my applications.  AA batteries are preferable to proprietary lithium ions because of their widespread availability and low cost.  Having 4 AAs instead of 2 is a good tradeoff that provides longer battery life at the expense of size and weight.  The vari-angle LCD lets me take photos from all angles.  I prefer point and shoot to DSLR because the cameras are less expensive and more convenient to carry and use.  Like its predecessors in Canons S-series, the SX10 lets you record audio for each shot which is a great convenience for documenting landmarks during my journeys. 10 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for the online pictures I mainly use and even for my occasional enlargements of 16x20.  The controls are very convenient to access.  The video quality is excellent.  It seems like Canon thought of everything.

I havent decided yet whether to buy a Canon flash for maximum compatibility or a different brand for less cost at the expense of reduced compatibility.  Since I use flash infrequently, I can wait to make that decision.  In a little more than a week Ive taken 500+ photos to experiment with the camera.  Im very satisfied that the SX10 provides the improvements I sought.</Content>

<Content>I have been using the SX10IS for over a month. I will only echo the positive reviews already posted. Im still in the process of exploring and expermenting with the special features of this camera. The result has been some very excellent and beautiful prints.

The only two negitive things that I find annoying, is the unattached lens cap and the instruction manual. Other reviews mentioned the lens cap problem. I wish there was a better way have this cap less likely to be misplaced. The manual presents a good amount of information in a very compact booklet. After several days of using this manual it broke apart into several loose pages.

I do not have any negitive comments for the camera. I am very happy with the features and operation of this product. I would recomment this camera to anybody that wants the ease of use of a point-and-shoot model and the many features that are available to you for photographic creativity.</Content>

<Content>I have been using manual SLRs all my life and was reluctant to go digital.  Amazon of course had the best price, but was I ever surprised regarding quality when I began using this camera.  It really does have all the functions a fancy SLR does but at a fraction of the cost.  For prior Canon EOS users, this is almost an exact replica.  You can still manually focus and manipulate shutter speeds and F-stops.  The picture quality is UNBELIEVABLE-even better than my fancy Hadsselblad.  Its small enough to carry anywhere and easy to use.  Memory card is only $14 at Best Buy.  The photo manipulatin software that comes with it is great too.  You can doctor up any image and make it perfect.  You will need an extra flash on the hot shoe if you are shooting from very far away in a dimly lit room but otherwuse the one the camera comes with does the job.</Content>

<Content>Lots of features for the money.  Im a NIKON person myself but I like this better than the average point and shot camera. No tripod necessary even with 10 MGP because of the image stabilizer which is why I bought the camera. It has a 20X zoom, a micro setting, a huge view screen that swivels for your convenience, takes movies with sound (3 mics). And these are just some of the features. Be sure to purchase a 4Gig memory card if you want to take advantage of the movie setting so you can shoot for 20 continuous minutes. Instead of packing up my NIKON gear I now take this camera with me almost anytime I go out. You can take very good pictures with it with just a little bit of practice so you will remember to change your distance settings to capture the right depth of field. I would recommend this camera to novice and serious amature alike. Its GREAT! If there is a drawback its that you cant use filters with it. To me that is not important with this camera.

<Content>Another one returned! Sorry Canon, I really like your products, but KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES for goodness sake!!!! (Excuse the rant) Ive tried just about EVERY point and shoot that takes some kind of video, plus countless other digital cameras over the years. The HD PSs Ive tried are: Canon TX1, Panasonic TX5, several flash drive camcorders that also take still pics, Sanyo HD1000  HD700, Samsung HV24HD, and ALL the Kodaks that take HD Video. Plus there has been other cameras - too many to mention (i.e. Canon 550, 770, etc.)

Anyway, I just bought (and returned) the SX10. I really wanted to love this camera, but will stick with my Sony T500 for now (check my review of the T500 - that little baby is a keeper). 

To keep it short, the still pictures are what you would expect from a Canon, but actually, I think my old Canon G7 takes better pictures. But here are the grips (I prefer the cons in a review more than the pros) in no particular order. 

1)	The Camera is BIG. Easy to hold but BIG. Love the flip screen - but the camera is BIG. Great lens - but BIG. I guess what Im trying to say, the damn thing is BIG, almost as big as a DSLR. This is something that you can not just slip in your pocket and run! I guess I would put up with the BIGness of the camera if the video was better (see below). 
2)	Battery: some might like it, but I did not. Four AA batteries! I had to buy a rather expensive charger and rechargeable batteries. Come on, whats going on here! Now adays with all this new technology, Canon couldnt come up with a small battery that holds a decent charge! I know the Sony T500 has poor battery life, but at least the camera is small - you would expect that! Who wants to schlep around 4 extra AA batteries - not me! This one was my fault, I did not ever read about the batteries before I bought the camera, but like above, if the Video was better, I could look the other way.
3)	Video: This was pretty important to me (again check out the T500). What is up with only the small video format when EVERY other camera company is opting for new 16:9 widescreen format? Again, my old G7 takes just as good small video and I can play/edit it with anything! Actually, the video from the SX10 is not all that good, except the fact that you can zoom all the way in (actually that is pretty cool), but not worth keeping it. I was hoping that even though the SX10 was not widescreen 720/1080, it would take decent HD like video with the new .MOV video format. Why Canon did not bring the SX1 out first Ill never know; because then if the videos were good - I might have kept the Canon. As many other reviewers have mentioned, I just dont understand these companies or their marketing plan. If they need any help, all they have to do is ask a few geeks like me - Ill tell em an ear full!

So all in all, Im keeping the Sony T500 - even if the pictures are not quite as sharp. That little camera is all I need - right now! Just my opinion Canon lovers.

<Content>This is my first ultrazoom camera.
I have used in Macys thanksgiving parade.
Pros :
-      Image Quality is good even in max zoom, Low light
-      Image Stabilization works fine taking pic in max optical zoom
-      Auto focus work fine.
-      If you have understanding of Shutter speed and Appeture, it gives nice manual Control, if you dont know - Auto mode will take care of everything.
- I like flipping LCD, which helps me to take picture with raising my hands it helped me take pics in too crowded area where i was not able to see parade, taking my pic with flipping LCD at 180 degree.
-    Video Quality is realy nice, and I was surprised by very clear Sound Quality which it capture with two microphones infront of camera.

Cons:
 Little bit bulky.But you have to pay prise for getting alle this above nice features.

Conclusion : Superb Camera with all Nice features..!

<Content>Many picture buffs like myself are torn between the weight, expense and size of many digital SLRs, and the increasing power and convenience of the near SLR portables.  Hardcore travelers like myself know the convenience of throwing a camera in a case or backpack, and the hassle that the weight, care and feeding of an SLR can pose on such trips. 

Fortunately, what Ive seen so far is that the high quality of zoom shots is setting a brand new standard with this new camera from Canon.  Earlier super-zoom models, or those with zooms in excess of 10x or 12x, suffered from image quality problems as long zooms strained the limits of the tiny processors needed to capture light and reduce the effects of vibration. All these negative effects increase exponentially with each increase in zoom power. It used to be that only the large lenses and higher sensitivity power of expensive SLRs solved this problem. 

Processor sensitivity has finally caught up with the portable 20x optical zoom. Finally 100mm zoom power, without SLR expense and weight.

<Content>This is an EXCELLENT camera!  I highly recommend purchasing it if youre in the market for a Mega Zoom.  I just cant say enough about it.  It offers several pre-set photo options.  The zoom is incredible.  Picture quality is also excellent.  It feels good in your hands.

I suggest that you study the manual to become familiar with the camera features.  Its an easy read.  Plan on burning the provided AA batteries becoming familiar with the camera (comparing the manual to actually testing them out on the camera).  Its worth investing the time to truly realize the cameras benefits.

I purchased rechargeable AA batteries rather than continually buying traditional alkaline batteries.  AA battery vs. a proprietary rechargeable battery was a feature I was looking for in this type of camera.  It doesnt burn through the batteries.

Again - its a great camera for armature or semi-professional photographers.  Good luck!</Content>

<Content>Its not a DSLR but it comes pretty darn close.  What doesnt it have that a DSLR does?

1. Well the obvious is you cant change lenses but with such a large zoom and super macro why carry around all that stuff just to take hobby shots?

2. The sensor is never going to be as great as the higher end cameras, but it does a darn good job if you know how to work your settings and use a tripod.

3. You cant shoot raw.  Again this is for the person who likes to take photos rather than switching out lenses, cleaning innards of the body, and sitting in front of the computer tweaking all day.

That being said if youre looking for a more professional camera  go for the new Rebel (I believe the new one has live view that the older models dont and that is a real plus.)

Okay so shooting at anything above 400ISO gets noisy.  My solution - use a tripod for longer exposures at a lower ISO or use flash when possible.

The zoom is great and though you do lose some quality there is an image stabalizer, you will get shake -- again use a tripod or monopod.

The thing is so easy to use, I never even read the instruction manual.  Its all right there on the camera, you just have to play around with it.

Burst mode is kinda slow, but again its under $400 camera -- there are going to be some trade offs for the all-in-one-point-and-shoot.

USE the scene settings, they are marvelous, and can actually help train you on how to set the camera manually. The indoor mode is fantastic at setting the white balance.

The best situation for any camera is lots of light so expect noise, blur etc in darker settings.  Get yourself a flash -- Speedlite 430ex or better if you have the cash. I am still waiting for mine, but if you like to bounce flash off the wall behind you do some more research on it.  Get a diffuser and/or bounce the crap out of it.  Experiment and play.  Once you learn the camera and its nuances, you will be able to get the most out of it.

Spend the money and get a fast memory card with a lot of space.

This camera is now my baby and I have used the Olympus Camedia 3.2 MP for quite some time and I have taken a lot of great photos with it.  I had the older rebel, hated that it didnt have live view and didnt have the money to buy fast telephoto lenses.  Sold it.  I recommend you keep yours if you have one though... they are great cameras.

I will be shooting intimate events (baby showers, small weddings, birthday and holiday parties) with this one and using my friends rebel as a backup.  LOL imagine that!!?  I figure I can make some of my cash back maybe even enough to get the new rebel.

If you want something that is easy to use, has a great zoom lens, takes great photos and is under $400, this is the camera for you.  Its a canon and the resale value should stick should you want to upgrade in a year.

<Content>An excellent camera for those just getting into photography, or someone not ready to spend a fortune on a pro camera. Tons of features that are easy to figure out, and make picture-taking a breeze. The zoom is wonderful for getting in close to your subject quickly and quietly. Havent had it for very long, so I havent used all its features yet. But, what I have used has made my shots better and more professional looking. Like someone who knows what theyre doing! Would recommend this camera. Great features for not too much money.</Content>

<Content>First let me say I am not any kind of photography expert.  I have owned a 35mm Canon rebel and a Minolta SLR.  The rebel took decent pictures but the Minolta was terrible.  So needless to say I never really learned to use them.  I was alway a Point and SHoot gal.  This camera takes AMAZING pictures straight out of the box.  THe large zoom really focuses well.  I still havent taken the time to learn about all the features but so far I am loving this camera. </Content>

<Content>I have had a bunch of digital cameras that have treated me right... Sony, Casio and Canon.  However this one is has almost everything I would want in a NON-SLR camera.

PROs
* Excellent camera for the price
* Support SDHC
* Uses standard AA batteries
* Flash hot-shoe
* DIGIC 4 delivers excellent image quality
* Lens is awesome
* Love the rotating screen.
* theres more but those are the main points

CONs
* Little bit bigger and heavier than the market competition cameras but it is not a huge hinderance
* The menus let you do a lot of cool things but it takes some getting used to and it not the most intuitive.
* Built in flash is crappy but you cant expect the built-in flash to be great. Its good for emergencies.
* As in other reviews the scroll wheel feels a little off, not enough to be a problem but it could be designed better.

Overall I am very pleased with this camera. I previously bought a Fuji S1000 - 10 Megapixel camera and it was a completely piece of crap compared to this one. I am very glad I returned that and spent the extra money on this one. My father is a pro-photographer and he has always used Canon, even in the film days. I will also stick with Canon from this point on, because it works and works good.</Content>

<Content>I own two other Canon cameras, A Digital Rebel Xt DSLR with two zoom lenses and a Power Shot A720 IS. The DSLR is used for serious photography and the A720 for informal family pictures and things like fishing. As I am getting older I am finding that the DSLR outfit is getting harder to carry so I was looking for a lighter outfit when I did not want to carry it. At first I thought that getting auxiliary lenses for the A720 would do the job but found it too bulky and inconvenient. Then Canon came out with the SX 10 IS. I got the first one my local dealer got in. It is far more versatile than the A720 but only slightly larger. It covers the complete focal length range I need for almost all picture taking needs. The quality of the pictures is slightly better than the already very good A720 at most ranges. At the extreme telephoto end it loses some as expected. Of course it is not as good as the DSLR but how can one expect a camera that sells for under 400 dollars to be as good as one that was over 1000 dollars? I was able to get close to the DSLR quality with a little help from my Photoshop Elements.

The camera is light for what it does and very convenient. I like the variable angle viewing for odd angle shots as close to the ground and the electronic viewfinder for bright situations. The electronic viewfinder is best for telephoto use as you can hold the camera steadier. The image stabilizer works all the way out to the 560mm equivalent but I recommend taking several pictures just in case. I like the fact that I dont have to carry extension tubes for close ups. The camera has too many other useful features to mention here. I have used it for over a month now and feel I got more than my moneys worth.

<Content>So far I have taken around 600 pictures with the SX10 and have only one complaint. I am having trouble fine tuning the selecting ringin SCN mode. I turn the dial and nothing moves and then all of a sudden it moves quickly to a selection I dont want and I have to begin again. Im just not in control. However, the 20x zoom exceeded my expectations. I had originally wanted an Canon SLR just to use my measly 200mm zoom from my 35mm film Rebel, but this is much better for me (560mm w stabilization works well). I was also waiting for Canon to up their ISO ratings and by using the 3200 setting I was able to get some nice photos of Hula dancers and hope to do as well with indoor sport pictures. The 28mm wide angle lens is a plus I didnt know I needed until I began using the camera. I was able to properly frame many more single pictures than previously.  </Content>

<Content>Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom The Canon SX10 IS is just what I was waiting for in a Canon point and shoot camera. Pros are is the 10 megapixels and the long 20 X zoom. The price wont rob your wallet either. The photos I have taken are great, sharp and clear. The  cons I have to mention is that it doesnt accept filters but I believe a company is working on making something fit. Ive read on line actually that some folks are using a 52 mm filter but Canon says it wasnt made to be used with filters. Also the program to download photos to your computer are not as easy as my Canon S-2 or XTi but that is not a big deal. You will be impressed with the pictures it takes.</Content>

Id try and find a S5IS which is a superior camera in regards to picture quality.  I think the advantages of the super zoom are also part of the downfall.  Looking through a tunnel, and youll get pictures that reflect this aspect.

Take your time and look at the picture samples taken from the S5IS versus the XS10IS - base your decision on your taste, not what you read.</Content>

<Content>I was the proud owner of a Canon S1 IS very soon after it was released. I loved the compact size, additional lens attachment, and zoom capability. Its quality was nice for the time but soon the megapixel race was on and 3MB images were left in the dust. I opted next for a Canon Rebel XT and spent $$$$ on lenses, flashes, memory, bags, tripods, etc. Dont get me wrong... I love my DSLR, but when I heard that the SX10 IS was available I did not hesitate to purchase it for my wife who was beginning to be a photo-junky like myself. The 20X zoom lens reaches from 28mm (wide angle)to 560mm (very long range) and is incredibly compact. The body is about the same size as my XT. It has the bells and whistles of a more sophisticated DSLR yet can operate as a point-and-shoot for those with less complicated needs. We love Yellowstone so this will be a magnificent addition to our arsenal of photo gear. Forget the time setting up a tripod since it has built-in image stability. Forget changing lenses for the scenery shot versus the distance shot. The image quality is very good, has more megapixels than my Rebel, and even fits in my wifes purse (though bulky). I give this camera an A+ for what it was designed for. My wifes only complaint is the need to keep up with a lens cap that was connected by a strap in earlier versions (S1-S5). Way to go, Canon! Buy it! I dont think youll be disappointed. I would even recommend it for the novice to intermediate photographer who is traveling and does not have the space for all the extras that a DSLR requires.</Content>

<Content>This camera is almost perfect. Im not going to be able to add much to what the other reviewers have stated: I agree with all the good points (type of batteries it uses, easy to hold, great lenses that adapt themselves to shooting almost anything, doesnt weight too much but, at the same time, feels solid, easy to use, the rotating LCD display, etc.).

I cannot comment on the filming angle of the camera since I do not use it for films. I expect that, if I do use it to film something, it will be along the lines like the use of the camera that my cellular phone has: as an emergency measure only. If I need to film then Ill get a film camera.

Getting back to the camera: Ive had mine for a bit over a week by now and shot over 400 photographs.

Im definitively NOT a power user, but I do know a bit or two regarding what constitutes a good photograph: if I like it then its a good one!

This machine makes almost all shots look like good ones. If you dont want to bother about anything, just select the AUTO function and zoom to the point of getting in the picture what you want. Period.

If, like me, you like to tinker a little (or a lot!), it has almost all the functions that you might wish for (and, perhaps, some more that you didnt know existed).

When I say that its close to perfect it is because:

a)	The shutter cannot be programmed for a lapse greater than 15 seconds. If you want to shoot stars or some other night pictures, this might be a bit of a concern. I would have liked the shutter to be fully programmable up to infinity.
b)	The low battery alarm only comes on when youre dangerously low on power. By then it might be too late. I would have liked a battery level indicator that tells me at all times what the level of power is so that I can take precautionary measures (like buying some more batteries ahead of time).
c)	The continuous shooting mode, when you have selected the 10 Mega pixel resolution, is slow. I was shooting a corrida here in México and action was a lot faster than what the machine was capable of capturing. Most certainly the 0.6 seconds that are specified need to be improved (perhaps up to 0.2 seconds or less). If someone tells me that I can get a faster response by lowering the resolution, my response would be: whats the point of getting a lot of low resolution pictures? If Im shooting something its because Im interested in it in the first place!

If I had to resume this machine it would go along these lines: It has almost everything that you might want but doesnt force you to use it: it leaves you the freedom to be the type of photographer that you are.

Not much else that I can add.

<Content>This is a very good camera for both beginners, intermediate and advanced users. Canon has given great features in this hybrid camera giving a 10MP and 20X optical zoom. The image stabilization is pretty good and even if you are moving (hands not stiff as well) the picture comes out great. I bought this and have taken 300+ plus photos and except for 10 photos taken in low light this has come really good.

The stitch assist feature is pretty neat, you can take perhaps the grand canyon as a single snap (kidding).

I suggest getting the sony batter charger and battery for this as it can last really long. The .mov files should not bother much and its clarity is also fine.

Overall this is a good camera with loads of features, if only they had reduced the price a bit more to say $330 or so.</Content>

<Content>This is a second update.  It comes after several months working with an SX10 IS.

SHORT LIST

Pros: 

Excellent resolution 
Very good noise control
Image edge and corner sharpness
Less than average color fringing 
True wide angle and phenomenal telephoto 
iContrast for highlight/shadow
Vari-angle LCD 
Focus frame size adjustment
Brightness, contrast, sharpness and color settings
Great movie mode with stereo sound 
Hot shoe 
Lens hood 

Cons: 

Slow f5.7 maximum aperture beyond 100mm 
Tendency to overexpose (though this can be an advantage--see below)
Low light autofocus issues
Minor lens distortions and color fringing at either end of zoom
Tedious control dial
LCD hard to see in bright outdoor light
Zoom sounds audible in movies

IN DEPTH

A semi-pro photographer with 30+ years shooting experience, I am respectful yet rigorously demanding of my photo equipment. I push parameters, often absurdly so, but the SX10 doesnt seem to mind it one bit. For its price point, features and class, this is a stellar offering, and I highly recommend it. 

The camera is solidly built and, although hefty for a point-and-shoot, feels well balanced in the hand.  Controls are intuitively placed and easy to find with your fingers--no need to take your eye off the LCD or viewfinder when youve become acquainted with their positions. 

Performance is excellent in all but low light, where autofocus and shutter lag are sometimes at issue.  The camera powers on and is ready to shoot very quickly. Image recording time is swift, especially with a Class 6 card, and in reasonable lighting focus is both swift and accurate.  Resolution is superb; image stabilization is best in class.  And the sheer zoom range--wow!

Point-and-shoot capability is great. Open the box, install batteries and memory card, and fire away. Its so easy, kids can do it.  And given a little time and tinkering, in its creative modes the camera really shows its chops.

In this review, youll see several references to existing-light photography. Its my personal preference; I only use flash when I must. So Ive spent a lot of time working out the angles for that sort of shooting. What you wont see is anything more than a cursory remark about action photography. Its not something Ive used this camera for just yet.

In this model Canon addresses several issues inherent in the S series--most notably noise and dynamic range.  Though still noisy at ISO 800, about half the images Ive shot at that setting have been okay for prints, and nearly all are very good at ISO 400.  Pictures taken between ISOs 80 and 200 are clean and excellent.  Noise reduction at higher ISOs does degrade saturation and details a bit (more noticeable at the longer end of the zoom, especially in low-contrast lighting) but not enough to abandon the higher sensitivities altogether.

Both edge and corner sharpness are very good at anything but widest angle and full zoom, and even here sharpness is much improved over the S5 at ANY focal length. In truth, no zoom lens of such wide range has edge-to-edge sharpness at its focal extremes.

Color fringe is a mixed bag.  Depends somewhat on the focal length, ISO, aperture and shutter speed.  Overall, fringing is not that bothersome.  At both the widest angle and full telephoto ends youll see some colored edges, most noticeably in areas of high contrast. Bumping the zoom lever once or twice makes all the difference.  

Some barrel distortion occurs at the wide end as well, though not too bad. Its only noticeable where there are obvious vertical or horizontal lines (again, a bump or two of zoom, and lines strighten right up). These issues can of course be corrected in most photo editing programs, although not in Zoombrowser EX, the cameras supplied software.

Achieving focus in certain lighting can be iffy and sometimes fails. Changing the focus frame size will usually remedy this. When it doesnt, manual focus feature comes to the rescue. Fortunately this feature is improved in the SX10. The autofocus issue seems linked to extremes in contrast, whether low or high, rather than actual light available.  Low contrast, low light situations present the most difficulty, but a couple of times my copy has struggled and failed in high-contrast, intense lighting, too. Lowering the ISO helped.

If you prefer existing light photos and stay at ISO 400 and under, at focal lengths beyond 100mm youll need to reduce shutter speeds due to narrowing apertures, and action shots get tricky.  For stationary subjects, though, the camera can be hand-held at speeds as low as 1/6 sec to produce sharp images without flash--phenomenal.  This works best with image stabilization set to single shot rather than continuous.

It IS a good idea to carry a mini-tripod or monopod. The SX10 tends some toward overexposure, though, which works to your benefit; an increase in shutter speed not only balances exposure but also results in fewer blurry hand-held shots. So, although its a good idea to have one handy, the tripod probably wont be needed too terribly often.

The cameras built-in flash is quite good to about 17 feet. Theres also a hot shoe for dedicated external flash; and with flash employed, the playing field broadens significantly. Ive not yet encountered a situation where I couldnt get a picture when working with flash. A few times manual focus has been necessary, but by golly, I got the shot!

That big lens does zoom--boy, does it ever! Furthermore, digitally zoomed images are surprisingly detailed.  Image stabilization is so effective that in good lighting sharp, hand-held shots are VERY doable at maximum magnification--a whopping 80X. The hardest thing about shooting at that length is just keeping the subject in your viewfinder!

Canons vari-angle LCD is thoroughly spoiling--it cooks. There have been many times when I simply wouldnt have gotten a keeper without it. An articulating LCD not only offers the flexibility to shoot no-hassle self portraits, overhead, ground-level and other awkward-angle pictures, but it also gives an extra measure of stability in composing your pictures. Just fold out and tilt the LCD and hold the camera close to your body with your elbows tucked in. Its a much steadier stance than the traditional arms-out, eye-level method. Makes for some good stealth photography, as well as opening up new perspectives (think children and pets). And its a real boon for tight spots and macro work.  My only quibble about the LCD is how difficult it is to see in bright sunlight. (Fortunately, the electronic viewfinder is excellent, so you can shoot, no matter what.) 

I really appreciate the ability to reduce the focus frame for capturing little details (its nice to have a camera that knows, for instance, that youre going for the antennae of a moth and not its entire body).  Better yet, you can zero in on the eye as the sharpest point in the frame, making for stand-out people, bird, wildlife and pet photos. Pictures are so much more arresting with this capability.

About iContrast:  while dynamic range does increase some, its not a magic wand. With it turned off this camera does pretty well (though not d-SLR well) at highlight and shadow details.  At least in my copy, pictures shot with iContrast are sometimes processed with a dull, gray-blue cast that no color or white balance setting offsets. So I keep iContrast disabled during shooting, unless the lighting is pretty extreme (the user guide suggests this approach). Ive found iContrast of greater benefit, editing images in Review mode.  Colors are more vibrant this way; the pics dont get that gray-blue cast.

SX10 pictures are not as contrasty as those from Canons previous ultrazooms, especially at longer focal lengths. This is not a design flaw--you now have the option to adjust contrast as a custom function. Its found in My Colors. Options for adjusting sharpness, saturation and skin tones--as well as red, green and blue channels, are available there, too.

Often pictures lacking in contrast are simply the result of overexposure. If youre using one of the cameras built-in My Color settings, in average to bright light exposure compensation frequently helps, adding vibrance to your images and upping highlight details. The exposure compensation button makes this easy.  On the other hand, photos captured in overcast and other low-contrast lighting conditions nearly always lack contrast, regardless of how you adjust exposure or which iContrast setting youre using. I personally dont mind this, as contrast can always be boosted in post-editing.

Even if youre a seasoned photographer, I cant stress enough: READ THE USER GUIDE even if youve owned one of Canons previous superzooms. While the SX10 is very similar to its predecessors, there are also some big differences. When I got mine, I didnt actually look at the guide for almost a week; until I did, I grew steadily more disappointed. And just knew that Canon had lost their marbles.  

If youre a full-auto kinda person, youll probably love the camera without reading through the whole manual--that is, until you make your first movie. If you havent read the advanced instructions for video capture, heres where youll probably encounter dissatisfaction. Be sure and read the advanced guide for movies on pages 87-90 (English version). For instance, you can lock the focus--very nice--no more fading in and out. But the thing I think youll really want to know about is a way to brighten movies when zooming.  (More on that in a bit.)
  
Its when you move beyond point-and-shoot into the creative zones that an in-depth look at the advanced guide gets essential.  The good stuff is in there all right, just waiting to be tapped, but youd practically have to be psychic to know how to work it.  Its not a hard camera to control, but some of its features and the procedures for using them arent exactly transparent. Youre paying for a pretty amazing, feature-rich camera. Instead of bashin or smashin the darn thing, do yourself and the SX10 both a favor. Read up on how to use it. Its well nigh impossible to get the best from it til you do.

In its auto modes, the camera selects ISO, aperture and shutter speeds which almost always work very well, although you may occasionally bring home noisier images than youd like, and the white balance can sometimes be just a tad off.  It also means employing the flash indoors fairly often, so if you prefer point-and-shoot, existing light photography you really may want to consider a different camera.

About Movie mode, in my estimation the only down side is the lens noise it records--an audible clacking sound during zoom. In every other respect, movies are outstanding. Before I bought the camera I had read user complaints about dark videos, and that concerned me. Sure enough, when I got the camera and gave it a whirl, my movies were just bogus beyond the 100mm tele mark.  

Then I read the advanced guide--duh.  And found that Canon has made provision for the lenss narrowing aperture as you zoom in. When you notice the image growing dim, you can increase the exposure--during recording!  Its very easy--a press of the exposure compensation button and a twirl of the control dial is all it takes.  Works like a charm.  And thats not the only new enhancement (earlier I mentioned focus lock). Before beginning a movie, you can also set preferences for white balance and color. With stereo sound, volume adjustment, a wind filter and such enormous focal reach, the Movie mode is a great addition to an already magnificent camera--why, its just gravy.
  
If anything ever fails on my copy, itll probably be the control dial. Learning to use it was pretty trying. The dial is thin and slippery, and the mount is too shallow, almost flush with the FUNC/SET button it surrounds.  The knurls on the dial are barely palpable and provide little traction.  Worse, the dial tends to slip while its turning. Applying enough pressure to engage it can inadvertently change the ISO setting or switch the camera to Manual Focus or Macro mode. My touch has improved with time and practice, but it took way too long to get the knack, and its still not surefire. The things just plain tetchy!

Despite its idiosyncracies, Im very glad the control dial is there. The SX10 is a camera that offers many adjustment options for making the very most of its incredible abilities.

If the dial were more easily engaged, and the zoom were silent during video capture, this camera would earn my resounding five-star rating. It probably deserves one anyway. If I didnt use the creative modes almost exclusively, the control dial wouldnt be such a bother. And if I werent so persnickety, the lens sounds in video probably wouldnt be an issue, either. The dial needs improvement, though. Because this camera falls in the advanced category, aimed at the photo enthusiast/advanced photographer, and because it is one of the most-used and important features for that kind of shooting, I cant rationalize away its mediocre design and just love the dial anyway.  Canon simply MUST improve on future iterations of their SX cameras, and I expect they will!

<Content>I purchased this camera to use on a visit to a game reserve in South Africa.  This device is far more than a camera for party pics.  A serious  photographer would aim higher, though you can capture serious images with the SX10IS.  Between those boundaries, I found the convenience, flexibility, and image quality of this camera to be a marvelous combination.  At $400 US retail, what a value!  I enjoyed the balance and feel of the camera in my hand.  The zoom made full frame shots a breeze.  The video feature is easy to use, and the image is of very good quality.  I took two 8 gig cards.  In four days, I almost filled one.  I bought a brick of batteries, but changed batteries once.  The image stabilization works very well.  On the long zooms I used a monopod for additional stability.  If you want to shoot five or ten frames per second, spend four times as much.  If youre happy to snap every 1.4 seconds, save your money.  The microphones work well.  They do pick up the sound of the zoom lens operation.  Im gifting one of these cameras to a friend.  I find Ive taken more pictures in the last month than I have the past year.  This camera is great FUN.   </Content>

<Content>I have owned 3 Sony Cybershots  H1,H5 and H9 prior to my purchase of my Canon today. I was about to purchase the new H50 and decided that the quality, the functions, extra shooting modes and 20x zoom were the clinching factors in my switch.I have only shot about 100 pictures i am seriously happy as a novice photographer. Incidentally the lens cap can be attached to the neck strap. </Content>

<Content>Ive had my SX10 for about a week and am very impressed with its versatility. I tend to read all the user reviews I can before making a purchase and did that with the SX10. I also tested the camera with my own card in a local store and compared video and stills on the same card to the Pany TZ28. I am very interested in video and was attracted to the Pany because of its HD video. However, in testing, the SX10 was overall very superior. It has excellent color, unbelievable IS, smooth zoom, very nice stereo sound, and fool proof autofocus. I found the Pany to be weak in all those areas. I prefer the better all around video to the HD of the Pany. 

Initially, I was spooked by the reports of a slow lens during medium to max zoom, 5.6 to be exact. I read enough reports to be convinced that the slow lens would not be especially restrictive for me due to compensation in ISO and speed setting, made possible by the excellent image stabilization. I have found the lens to be just fine, even at max zoom. I also found that the lens is fast enough for indoor non flash photography. I even tested the ISO 3200 setting, which requires a lower mp setting. I printed these out at 3x5 and the pictures were very good.

At first, the LCD seemed dark. After I turned up the setting to bright, it was better. After using it awhile, it seems fine. The EVF is large and bright, the best Ive seen.

When the professional reviews come out, there will certainly be knocks on the slow lens. In my opinion, this is more of a theoretical limitation than a practical one. If you like the camera, dont be spooked by the slow lens comments. If youre not sure, buy from Amazon with their excellent return policy. 

One really solid feature is the wide angle of the lens. This was not a feature I thought I wanted or needed. Now that Ive seen the wide angle, Ill never have another camera without it. 

There are many other features that most will enjoy, including the dedicated video button, AA batteries, custom settings etc. I think average and very serious photographers alike will be happy with the SX10.</Content>

<Content>After waiting over five months for what I thought was going to be a terrific camera to hit the shelfs, I simply had
to send it back after having it for only two days....

Now, Ive had over eight (8( digital cameras and I do love them so!...The reason I bought this camera was for its Movie capabilities. My hobby is creating slideshows with music, and Ive done many of them. So, I had planned to use not only photos in the slideshow, but also some video also, just to have the slideshow flow with  a bit more variety.

Id also like to add that Im stricly a Canon person. Yes, Im sure there are other super cameras out there, but I know and understand Canon cameras,so, Ill just stick with them.

What I find a bit strange here is that since Im a Canon person, why did I rate it only One (1) star?...
Each Canon camera Ive had in the past Ive loved!.  Here was the problem:  The Wheel on this camera simply didnt turn well at all. It would hesitate and move just when it felt like. And, the Movie mode ergonimics was
what I felt Clumsy...

Of all the eight (8( Canon Cameras Ive owned, Ive never ever returned one!. And, the ergonomics on ALL of those cameras was superb!..  My very first Canon camera was the S330 Elph, some eight years ago, and right from the box, it took me no time to set it up!. And so were all the other Canons that easy also..

And, the Audio on this cameras supposed to have great stereo audio? When I played back the movie that I had taken with it, the audio sounded pretty bad to my ear. 

[...] Ive purchased other cameras from them in the past, and have never returned anything to them, buy even though their delivery was super fast, I got the camera in 48 hours. But, you can be sure Ill not be buying another camera from them simply because of their restocking charge.

To be fair, after I had rated this camera a One (1) star, I realized that I had rated it incorrectly. When I then went to rate it for Three (3) stars, the Amazon interface or whatever, would not allow me to change the one star to a three star.

Im sure that this camera will be just right for many people and my dilemma with it will most probably not be similar to others who have this camera or are going to buy it. </Content>

<Content>I have owned and loved every S series camera since the S2 and so I was very apprehensive when I learned that they had made dramatic changes to the next iteration.  The size is bigger, the zoom is longer, video files more compressed and the button layout has been switched around a good deal.

Its not that I resist change, I just believe that if youve got a good thing going - DONT MESS WITH IT!  But I had already promised my photo-loving little sister that Id give her my S5 when the new one came out so I figured I had to at least give it a try, so I went ahead and ordered it.

I was most worried about the new video format as that was my favorite feature of the previous cameras, so as soon as I received the SX10 I ripped it out of the box, threw a 4gb extreme 3 memory card in and hit the record button.  4gb provided a little more than 45 minutes of the highest quality of video on the new .mov format, while on the S5s .avi, I got a little less than 30 minutes, but Ive never been one to complain about the size of the files - just the quality!  I walked around, trying to test it in as many ways possible, bright light, low light, wide open, fully zoomed, inside, outside, etc.  I could tell that this camera had a more difficult time staying in focus when I zoomed in and out than the previous S cameras, but it wasnt appallingly bad, and I figured if that was the worst thing, it would still be a wonderful camera.  So I watched the video on my computer and even though I was annoyed with having to use quicktime and found it a little less convenient (.avi files are displayed in windows with a picture of the first frame, making them very easily identified, whereas .mov files just show the quicktime Q, meaning I would have to come up with catchy titles for all of my many video clips), I had to admit that the video quality was still quite good, and I think the audio is even a little better (that might just be the camera though).  

At this point Ill talk about my impressions of the body handling.  It is definitely larger than the S5, but still not nearly as large as any SLR Ive ever handled - it still has a relatively compact feel, expecially considering it zooms all the way to 560mm!  The grip in the right hand does feel a little weak and slippery, but I didnt ever have a problem with it slipping.  In the left hand though, it actually feels quite nice as the larger lens protrusion gives you something to hold on to, including some very functional ridges along the bottom.  So Id say the ergonomics are very decent.  The buttons are placed fairly well (Id switch the play button with the function button) and they all feel nice.  The wheel I hated, but Ill get to that later.

So it barely passed the first test, but I still wasnt convinced and I cleared 6 hours from my Saturday to really give it a thorough examination.  I also brought my SD1100 just to have something to compare the pics and vids too.

I tried testing every limit of this camera as I stalked a crane, observed an ant colony, tried (unsuccessfully) to catch fish as they sprang from the water and just enjoyed a wonderful day among nature.  Within the first five minutes I had come across two fairly serious issues.  The colors and exposure of the viewfinder were terrible; things that shouldnt have been blown out were, and I had a difficult time composing a shot as nothing looked nice!  The second problem came when I switched to manual (my preferred shooting method) and realized that the wheel had actually made things more complicated as now you have to adjust exposure and shutter speed on the same wheel and switch between them by pushing a button, whereas before up-down (on the 4 way selector) did the exposure and left-right did shutter speed.  The interface has been improved but that was little consolation as I found this to be very frustrating.

But even all of this could have been forgiven if everything else was great.  The flip screen was as good as ever, so I pushed on.  

When I was finished I was actually feeling pretty good.  I really enjoyed the extra zoom on this camera and I thought it handled very well.  I had my reservations still, but I felt like I could get over them and learn to really love this camera.  Not to mention I was really excited about some of the pictures I had taken and wanted to get back to my computer and see how they really looked.

This is when things got ugly, pun intended.  Ive read all the other reviews and I know some people say this camera produces sharp pics, throughout the entire zoom range, but I have to disagree, strongly.  At the long end of the zoom, pictures look like theres a slightly filmy sheet of glass in between my subject and me.  Any bit of cropping and this becomes very pronounced.  The NR on this camera is very strong and any high-contrast, straight lines were severely deformed.  Almost like the mirage effect only more blocky.  Wide open, the pictures just had no detail and looked just...  bad.  Im so glad that I brought my SD1100 because I was really convinced when I started looking at my comparison shots, that the SX10 needed to be returned.  The shots out of my 165 dollar point and shoot looked really sharp and pretty, while the same exact shot out of the SX10 looked completely emotionless and stale.  I couldnt believe it.  I double and triple checked that the nice shots were actually the SD1100 but I assure you they were.  

In all fairness I did get about 8 really nice shots with the SX10, but that was out of more than 200, and I know had I been using my S5 I would have had a much higher percentage.

So now I dont know what to do.  It seems kind of silly to buy a camera that I just gave away and right now Im kind of disillusioned with Canon.  I might try the Fuji S100FS.  I hope this helps and if you do decide to get this camera - good luck.</Content>

I bought the SX10 a few weeks ago.  It is a keeper for me.  The 28mm equiv wide angle is great, and the 20x optical zoom has been enjoyed many times.

The EVF is very bright and large.

A lot of good features which I will not repeat.

But for the price this camera really does it all - the video is awesome and easy to use - clear, great picture and being able to use the 20X optical zoom (which you cannot hear at all when used!) is a huge plus.  Also, for someone like me (not a camera expert) the macros are easy to use and the picture quality is great.  For the price you cant beat this camera.</Content>

<Content>Greetings everyone!

I waited so long to buy my canon s5 just waiting for the sx10...just in case I wanted to get the most recent model. So I wanted to love the sx10. I mean what would there be not to love with a 20x zoom.

Well alot and I am really disheartened after testing it out and I will be sending it back to amazon as soon as I receive one of the last s5s sold by costco. I bought mine last night and today they had taken them down from their site. So I got lucky.

So I was willing to compromise on alot to keep the sx10 because I really do appreciate huge zooms especially one with a nice wide angle.

I was willing to live with the mov format over the avi because when I viewed it from my laptop the quality is not too much different than the avi though a little more complex to process for some people.

I was willing to live with the bulkier lens yet for incognito purposes like concerts the s5 without lens adapter can pass for a point in shoot while the sx10 really looks like a dslr almost the size of my Nikon d40.

Now since I have a dslr you might ask why I wanted the s5 when clearly the images cant come close to the d40. Well, I really love the articulating screen for when Im doing blogging or making some kind of how to video for youtube where I can watch what Im filming while Im basically filming myself.

I mostly want to keep the s5 for the video capabilities because its very good in low light even in an aquarium setting. Which brings me to the deal killer of the sx10 it is just terrible in low to medium lighting when using the zoom.

I was outside in fairly good light filming my airedale playing soccer and the lcd grew dark when I zoomed in. At first I thought, oh defective camera until I realized it was just the change in fstop.

If canon had been able to keep the same f stop range as the s5, I would have tolerated everything else for the nice wide angle and telephoto zoom which I do love and for the ability to use a higher iso with less noise. But high iso cannot compensate for its poor performance in anything but strong sun lighting. But with the change in control dial which is tedious and the inability to add filters and the terrible low light performance...Im forced to pass on this upgrade.

I did discover in my testing if you put a 55mm polarizing filter over the lens it will stay put and if you carefully twist the polarizing ring you can can take pictures with it but you have to be very mindful and this would probably prove tedious in a real world photo session. And I for one really love using a polarizer.

So those are my frustrations and I am disillusioned after having such high hopes for this camera. 

So what Im left grateful of is that I have the s5 to fall back on for when I want to use an articulating screen for picture taking and a really high quality, low light ability of the video.

Warmly,

Laurie

<Content>Im in first days so cant give detailed report but I can say it is a big step ahead of my Powershot A620, that was a very satisfactory camera.  But the 20x was a big inducement since it will help me in kind of shooting I enjoy.  There are many more controls than I am used to, and it will take time to make full use of all.  But I am already benefitting from such controls as iContrast.  Today I was trying to photgraph a waterfall and was frustrated by a shadow in the center because sun not exactly as I would have liked.  I turned on iConrrast and took the shot. The shadow was gone and the rocks it was hiding were clearly seen.  I dont think I could have done better if the sun changed position.  I have also taken photos with the zoom and achieved results far superior to what I was getting with previous camera.

I think there should be threads on end of lens so that I could use filters, such as a polarizer.  However, Lensmate is fabricating an adapter that will permit the use of filters.  But the absence of threads is one of reasons I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.

This is definitely a camera anyone who wants an advanced non-SLR camera should consider.  For me, it seems to be the perfect camera, giving me many of the controls of an SLR but without need to buy and carry lenses.

UPDATE

I have taken several hundred photos since writing my first review so can now say it is perfect for my use.

Some reviewers complain a bit about the weight; I like the weight.  It weighs noticeably more than my Powershot A620, but I like the substanial feel when I use it.  I dont shake more with this camera, if anything less, and the image stabilization lens takes care of that.

Some have commented about the camera being slippery.  I have not noticed that.  Dont know why, but to me the SX10 is not a slippery camera.

I am really pleased with the wide angle lens, something I did not have on the A620.  I didnt know what I was missing.  Likewise the 20x zoom. What a difference compared to the 4x I was using.  This is great for distance shots, I am also using it like a macro lens.

I know now that I made the right choice.  I have most of the options I would have if I purchased an SLR, but at a much lower price.

The camera isnt perfect, but no camera is.  Id like threads so I could use a polarizer, and I dont like the wheel used to change the aperture value or shutter speed.  It works, but is more time consuming than the way it was on the A620.

I like the camera so much that now I feel as thought I was nit-picking when I rated it 4 instead of 5.</Content>

<Content>So far tried just a few shots with this camera. The macro is very impressive, the white balance is good in all conditions I tested (and I did try some hard ones), the 20X zoom is mind-blowing. In good light focusing was fast and sharp, good improvement over the S5 IS. Image processing was very fast too, thanks to the Digic4 processor.

Cons. In low light, the performance is limited, just like any powershot-range camera. Because of densely packed pixels on the sensor, any ISO over 200/400 is unusable. This also limits your zoom at low light, you will need to keep it steady for long exposures. If you plan taking loads of shots in low light consider something else (may be the long-promised Panasonic G1?). </Content>

<Content>Ive owned each new version of this camera since the Powershot S2IS.  For me this is a worthwhile upgrade over the prior version, the S5IS.  

Ill start by saying that I am not a digital camera power user.  I just want good quality photos without a lot of hassle.  This camera provides that, yet also provides a lot of room for growth with plenty of custom settings that I can use if I want to learn how to use them in the future (for example, aperture priority).

Pros:
-  In initial testing, the face detection technology seems to work well.  I can take a self portrait now and the lighting comes out very good.  I think the technology has gone from buzzword marketing to true usefulness.

-  One side benefit of the face detection technology is that it enables the camera to intelligently take red-eye out of pictures without using the red-eye reduction lamp.

-  The flip-out and rotating viewfinder has always and continues to set this camera apart from its peers from other companies.  It allows for less intrusive candid photos and has many other advantages.

-  Thankfully, the SD card door is separate from the battery door as it was with the S3IS.  Thank you Canon!  There are times that I just want to take a few pictures, and now I dont have to open the battery door to take the SD card out and put in my PCs card reader.

-  Low battery warning.  I think this is the first version to have that and its very welcome.

-  28mm -- I will never get another camera without wide angle built in.  I have the Canon Elph 880IS too, which is a very powerful pocketable camera that complements this one well.

-  Sharp 20x zoom.  Pictures turn out very good even at high zooms.  In an indoor-lit apartment, I can read fairly small print from a photo taken all the way across a room -- it truly is amazing.

-  The picture quality is better at higher ISOs than previous models.  Each model improves on this and this one definitely continues that.  I havent tried out the I-Contrast setting (on vs. off) but I can say that in some outdoor pictures that I have taken detail is good in shadow areas.

-  Finally, a standard lens-cap.  It doesnt have a tether, but you can buy a cap attachment from a camera store that sticks on the front of the cap.  The one that I got has an elastic band that goes around the base of the lens.  I also got a better lens cap which can now be done since its standard.

-  Controls ...  I like the new placement of the controls such as dedicated on-off button and display button.  I dont think I will like the scroll wheel but time will tell.  For those not familiar with this camera, there is a dedicated video button so that you can take video quickly without having to mess with the controls.

-  Weight and shape.  I liked the shape of the S5IS a little better.  This one seems too boxy and the grip seems too abrupt.  Its bigger and heavier but not in a way that matters.  Its expected with the new lens.

The only thing I would have liked to see improved is the size of the rotating display.  Its usable, but the 3 one on my pocket SD880IS is much better, and competing cameras offer a larger display.  In order to get a larger display though the electronic viewfinder would probably have to be eliminated which is something that many wouldnt like.  Id rather have a larger display.

I dont know if the compressed movie mode results in less quality because I didnt take movies with prior versions of this camera because the file size was larger.  I like that videos take up less space now and I will use the video feature of this version.

Canon released a camera similar to this with HD video capabilities but its not available, as far as I know, in the U.S.  Check the Canon website for more info. if you want to research that.

There is not a way to screw filters on this camera as there was with the optional lens adapters available for the S5IS.  It seems that Canon could have easily done this by threading the end of the lens but maybe I am missing something.  I anticipate that Canon or some other company will come out with an adapter that will allow filters.  My main use of filters was simply to protect the lens.

I dont know if the software is improved because I dont use it.  If you want date / time stamps on your photos, you need to do it via software.

If you like this camera and are interested in a great pocket-sized camera to complement this one, check out the SD880IS.  It has many of the same features such as the Digic 4 chip, face detection, wide angle, I-contrast, and in addition it has a beautiful 3 display.

Update 10-26-08
-  I previously commented that I thought the shape was too boxy and the grip too abrupt.  After using the camera for a while I have grown to like the shape because it helps keep the camera more steady and helps prevent dropping it.  There is a ridge below where the index finger is, and above the other 3 fingers holding the camera.  That helps keep a good grip on the camera which makes it steadier while shooting and helps prevent dropping it while carrying it around.</Content>

<Content>I have been looking forward to the S6 IS coming out this year (after skipping out on the S3 and S5), and now its out, with the name SX10 IS.  I think Canon wanted to show that this camera is a huge leap forward from the S5 IS, and it certainly is given the new specs.

Compared to the S2 through S5, the zoom is now 20x optical starting at 28mm instead of 12x starting at 35mm (much wider shots), as well as a 10MP sensor, up from 5-8MP, and Digic IV (instead of Digic II and III) for improved shots.

I tried out the demo model in the store, and some differences I noticed were:
- The camera is much taller and deeper to accommodate the huge lens, and does not feel as good in my hands as even the S5
- The body of the camera is very smooth compared to previous models, but it feels bulky compared to the S5
- The button layout is COMPLETELY different, there are no buttons on the front of the camera, MF and macro buttons are located in the back, you now press a button to turn the camera on and off (instead of turning a jog dial), the 4-way directional pad has been replaced with a clickable scroll wheel, also to enter playback mode you must press a button instead.  I do not like this layout, but it does offer the advantage of being able to enter macro and MF mode using your right hand only.
- After taking a shot, you can view very detailed information about the shot (ISO, aperture, histogram, etc) which is a nice add-on
- The lens is marked on the top with approximate zoom levels and focal lengths
- Unlike the S5, the battery compartment is again separated from the SD-card slot, which is good
- The picture quality is better, thanks to improved high-ISO quality, so the pictures come out less blurry than on the S5.  The sharpness and auto-focus at 20x is very good, with no visible distortion at any zoom level

I did not see the intervalometer function in the menu, so I assume it is still gone as it was removed in the S5, also no RAW support, and there is no custom firmware available for the SX10 (since it is Digic IV), look for that in the future.  Movies are in .MOV format instead of .AVI, still 480p, and still one of the best camcorders around.

The MSRP is also $100 lower than the S5 was at launch, making this a terrific bargain for a 20x superzoom with Canons great quality.  My only concerns are with the size of the camera and the button layout.  However, the huge zoom lens makes up for it, and the fact is it is still much smaller and lighter than a D-SLR plus wide-angle and telephoto lens.  Overall, you cant go wrong with this camera, the quality is superb.</Content>

<Content>This camera replaced my old Olympus C2100, a formidable 10x zoom camera introduced 8 years ago that started the mega-zoom race. Have played with the SX10 IS for a week now and very happy with it. 

Below are what I like:
-It uses regular AA batteries. Never buy a camera that uses specialized batteries no matter what people may tell you.
-It has a useful 28mm wide angle lens. This means you can include a whole group of people in a picture without standing too far back(such as in a small room). Most cameras (I say 90%) do not have lens this wide.
-You can zoom (optical  digital, with audio) while taking movies. Many cameras do not allow optical or audio during movie taking.
-It takes SD memory cards which is most popular (plentiful, cheap). Do not settle for cameras that take any other type of memory cards.
-It has a rotating LCD display.
-It is quick to take (and view) pictures and movies.
-Picture and movie quality (with stereo audio) is superbly competitive to any other high quality cameras.

Below are what I dont like:
-No grip: this is one slippery camera. I like its size and weight but its grip needs to be designed accordingly.
-The LCD display is very easily scratched. Do not wear this camera with a neck strap with the LCD facing out, because your shirt buttons will scratch the LCD. Immediately put a protective screen on this LCD first; there are several protective screen or tape products available.
-The lens has no thread so you cant put on a lens filter to protect it from smears and dust.
-The lens cap has no tether or tether hole so there is little you can do to attach the cap to the camera. Canon, what was you thinking?
-I wish it can record movies in widescreen 16:9 VGA. It does not have HD movie feature but I dont need HD, I only wish widescreen VGA.

Currently there are several 20x zoom cameras available, such as the Olympus SP-570UZ and SP-565UZ, Casio EX-FH20. Ive tried all of them, and eventually chose the Canon SX10IS as I think it gives you superb features and quality for an unbelievable price.

<Content>I bought this as an upgrade to my trusty old Canon S2.  Based on 3 days experience, the photographic aspect of the camera is great - better than the S2 particularly the 28mm wide angle.  However, I have a few little complains on the ergonomic side.

(1) The cammera is significantly larger and heavier than the S2.  And it is bit of a pain since I cannot reuse my old S2 camera case.

(2) The SX10 comes with a clip-on lens cap which is pretty finicky to put on in comparison to the S2 plastic lens cap which I can easily and quickly slap on to the lens housing.  Furthermore, while the S2 cap comes with a string to be attached to the camera body.  That is not the case with the SX10.  So I can see losing my lens cap pretty soon. 

(3) The inside grip on the S2 is kind of sanded so it can be gripped firmly.  The grip on the SX10 is smooth and a bit slippery. It does not offer me as firm and confident a grip as the S2, particularly when the camera is heavier.  May be it will become less slippery with time.  

Other than the above, good camera.</Content>

<Content>I just bought this camera and took some shots. Its an excellent one. I am the owner of both S3 IS and EOS XSi, so I can easily judge the quality of the SX10 IS. For $400, its definitely a good buy. Its bigger than S3 IS, almost the body size of Xsi.

Image quality is very good, correct color rendering (surely, not as good as Xsi, however, but its sharpness is better than Xsi).

The only thing I dont like is the EVF. When I move camera around, the view is not smooth, rather jumpy, make my eye uncomfortable. Again, for the price, what you get is a lot.

<Content>Ive only had this camera for a couple weeks, but I love it. It replaces a Fuji, which I admit was smaller and had a couple features that I would have liked--auto panorama for one. The Fuji doesnt have a view finder. Since most of my photography is outside, in the sun, and I always wear sunglasses, not having a viewfinder was a deal breaker. No more squinting; no more waving the camera at arms length and hoping to keep the scene in view. I hope my husband enjoys the Fuji.

The controls are pretty intuitive--I dont have to constantly refer back to the instructions to find what I want. Yes, the on/off button is a little strange, but once I realized that pushing with my fingernail crosswise on the button worked, I was fine with it. 

The picture quality is fine and it isnt hard on batteries. </Content>

<Content>I had Canon SD450(5.1 Mega Pixel) camera earlier and it was getting old. So I was looking for replacement for a reasonable price. I think SD890IS is good find for 10Meg Pixel and 5X optical zoom. On our recent California and Nevada trip I used this camera for all time. In Disneyland it captured motion perfectly in background which I had issue in my old Canon camera. I am impress with photo click in night mode in LV. It was fun to carry to camera in your pocket. I will recommend anyone to buy big size SD card so that you can click/capture video for 3-4 days without any problem

Pros:

1) Small size
2) Long bettery life
3) Faster clicking compare to my earlier canon camera
4) Motion capturing
5) High resolution 
6) 2.5 inch LCD viewfinder.
7) 5X optical zoom. I had 3X in old one. More is better in this case but large may increase the weight. So I think 5X is good enough to take indoor and outdoor pictures for any roadtrip.
8)Canon. Why because most of the people wherever we visted in CA and NV they were using Canon. I did not had to educate them on how to operate this camera. Its easy right. 

Cons:
1) I had hard time clicking ON and OFF this camera. May be they go to make little soft button for ON/OFF switch
2) This camera is little wider and bigger then old one. I thought as technology grows they should make slim cameras.
3) No touchscreen on LCD. I think Canon should have one of this feature like SONY or others are making it.

Overall I found this camera is flawless for such low price. I think its reasonable under this market condition when you can buy camera for less then 200 bucks. Good luck everyone for your shopping.  </Content>

<Content>In general I love this camera, however I will send it back and get another model. The on/off switch is a little piece of plastic that is flush with the camera body. I have been using my fingernail to push it. Obviously, it will break, crack, or just be pushed in where it is no longer flush with the body.....Yes, its the worst on/off switch Ive ever seen on what is otherwise a wonderful camera. Canon will have many of these sent in for repair sometime in the future, so they should be prepared...thank you for the opportunity write this review.

<Content>I recently had to upgrade from my Canon Powershot SD550 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Beige) after subjecting it to more abuse than any electronic device should be expected to survive.  (Amazingly, it was only the flash that failed after I dropped the camera on a hard floor for the Nth time; everything else on the camera continued to work just fine.)  I did call Canon to see if repair was a possibility.  Although they would repair it, it would cost me at least a hundred bucks, and when I remarked that that was nearly the price of a new one, they informed me that I could use their customer loyalty program, in which you trade in your old camera for a new model at a price much lower than the same model is sold at on Amazon (I got the 890IS for $150).  These are factory refurbished cameras, from returns or mis-orders, but Ive always had good experiences buying factory refurbished computers and thought it was worth a shot.  The new camera arrived by FedEx 2-day delivery -- just as quick as Amazon Prime -- and included a prepaid label for me to ship back the broken 550.  So I was never without a camera, which was great, since this all unfolded the day my daughter was born.  The 890 did arrive with an absurdly tiny SD card but I was able just to use the card Id had in my 550, fortunately.

The 890 IS has a nearly unchanged interface from the 550, which is good because the interface on these Canon cameras is very intuitive and easy to use.  The one major change is this: on the 550, there was a dial to turn to select auto mode, manual mode, camera mode, or photo playback.  On the 890, the photo playback feature has been removed from that dial, and is now toggled via a separate button on the back of the camera.  The advantage to this change is that you dont lose any settings you may have set up in manual mode if you want to review your photos, which is very nice.  However, it also means that you cannot turn on the camera just to review images without the lens barrel extending with its little whirring noise.

Another noticeable improvement over the 550 is the warmup time -- its incredibly quick, ready for action as soon as youve turned it on and positioned it to shoot.

All in all, the 890 is just another in a long line of Canons fantastic little cameras -- very small, easy to use, producing crisp, beautiful images, allowing the user a decent amount of control over features like flash, focus, and continuous shuttering.  Its hard to imagine anyone but a professional photographer needing something more capable.</Content>

<Content>I had a Sony Cybershot, which I liked a lot... it had some years with me, so it was time for a change. By suggestion of some friends I got into Canon... and in terms of value for money, this is the best model.
Pictures are cristal clear, 5X zoom, and the Image Stabilizer works great, the whole feeling of a real camera, which it is.
I recommend to get at least a 4GB SD memory with this one, pics at highest resolution (10 Mpxls) are quite heavy in memory... but they worth it.</Content>

The power button is easy to operate if you have small fingers.  It takes pictures rather quickly and does a great job in different light settings.  The zoom is wonderful and takes great upclose pics.  I do not have a steady hand and the pictures are not blurry.  My previous digital cameras were sony and kodak easy share.  Compared to both brands, I am much happier with the Canon.  </Content>

This camera provides excellent images and has many key features.  It has the longest optical zoom (5x) of any of the pocket cameras I looked at.  It does lack an aperture priority that I would like to have, but for the money, this camera is an excellent value.</Content>

<Content>This is a great camera.  Just bought it a week ago, took it to Hawaii and found out what great pictures it takes.  The photos have good color, clarity, saturation and look very natural.  I only had to tweak a couple of pictures with the included software which is very good as well.  The night snapshots worked very well as long as you dont zoom in.  Probably the most surprising feature was the video (movie) mode.  All the movies I took turned out extremely well for a point  shoot camera.  Even some night time shots at the Luau of a fire dancer where almost all the lights were off was good.  Not as good as a dedicated video camera, but for having to carry only one camera - it was more than acceptable.  Overall I love it - would recommend to anyone.

Pros: Small, easy point and shoot, start up time about 1.5-2 sec.  Shot to shot about 2 sec with settings about middle for picture quality.  Video really works well.  Battery lasted almost 5 days (about 250 pics and 15 1-3 min videos).  Nice sized LCD and many manual features which I didnt use many of except for night snapshot.  5x optical zoom - larger than most in this class.

Cons: Have to take battery out of camera to charge.  Wish shot to shot time was a little faster, but is acceptable.</Content>

<Content>Had an old Pentax that wss wearing out after 8000+ shots,  Needed a similar small camera to continue photography  because one hand shakes with Parkinsons.  Looked over the specs of several small cameras in the $200 - $300 range and found this one had all the features for control and specialty photos that I wanted.  Very sharp focus, excellent zoom range,  good ISO and better color fidelity means less Photoshop work.  Still learning where the different featurs are buried in the control system so that my fingers go there without resorting to the manual.  But Im happy with what I done so far.  Four stars, to me, is a very enthusiastic rating thats hard to beat.  Negatives are a little heavier and the nice looking rounded body makes it a little harder to hold.  Also, the zoom for taking and reviewing photos is step-wise rather than continuous.  This make framing a photo just as you want harder but Photoshop is always available for accurate cropping.</Content>

<Content>Wonderful value product here.  You get a lot of camera for the price you pay.  Lots of features that are over and above the norm for the price range, like 5X optical zoom, LCD AND optical viewer (getting both is rare), image stabilization, 10 megapixels.  Most cameras in this price range will give you 3X, Only a screen viewer, no image stabilization, and about 7 mp.  
I dont particularly like the power button - very hard to reach.  I suppose on the plus side its hard to accidentally turn it on while in your pocket.  
Navigating the menu options is a little cumbersome.  There are up down left right buttons as well as a scroll wheel.  You never seem to intuitively know which to do.  So far the pictures have been great, but they have been your run of the mill people shots.  Havent tried anything special yet.  Hope this helps.</Content>

<Content>This has been a great throw in your purse kind of camera.  We bought it because my husband was traveling to the Philippines and didnt want to lug around our Canon S2 IS (which is a fabulous camera...but its big and heavy).  Weve loved our big Canon Powershot so decided after a ton of research to keep with Canon knowing the quality wouldnt be as good but that my husband could keep it in his pocket or I could throw it in my purse.  It works great.  Takes great pictures.  

Lots of people complain about the on/off button which is kinda weak but is not really such a big deal.  I turn the camera on and off with my fingernail and Im careful with it since people have complained about some fatal error that I certainly dont want.  

I would definitely recommend buying a carrying case so the screen (and camera in general) doesnt get messed up.  Its a great camera though.  Would highly recommend it.</Content>

<Content>This model is, for the most part, better than the Canon 10MP PowerShot camera I bought two years ago (which was stolen), and $400 dollars cheaper!  The 5X rather than 3X zoom is wonderful and review mode is easier. The on/off button, however, is horrible!  Its made of plastic that I fear will fall out, and you have to push it on or off with a fingernail, for it is recessed too deeply to use a fingertip.  What really makes me angry though is the battery.  I had three extra of the NB5L batteries--I do a lot of caving, so use up battery power quickly.  The on-line data and the guide book that came with the new camera all say it uses the same battery as the older model, but no.  It has an N118 battery, which is a teeny tiny fraction shorter than the NB5L so that the NB5L will not work and I have to buy new spares.  Canon--why in the world did you change it to a new battery?  Just to get more money?</Content>

<Content>Just got this today.  Would give the camera casing a 3 star rating, but the photo quality is excellent.  It iiiis true what they say about the on/off switch. What a pain to push it in, but my complaint is the battery covering.  It feels so flimsy that it could fall off with the slightest bang.  When I closed it, it appeared to be slightly out of line.  I immediately checked the length of the warranty, which says 1 year, so we will se what happens.  I snapped a couple of test shots in low lighting and the pictures came out great and very sharp, despite the incredibly grainy preview image on the screen.  Gonna keep it though because I have faith in Canon and the photos came out great... </Content>

I cant complain much about the camera other than  hard to press power on/off button and the small zoom control. Maybe its because of my big hands, but these two buttons are difficult for me to use.

The pictures I was able to take were amazing. Im glad I bought this as a secondary substitute for my Canon Digital SLR

<Content>The SD890IS is my fourth Cannon digital. I am particularly pleased. I am testing it on a three week ski trip. Features such as Snow and Anti- Shake work better than expected. I have used the Continuous for recording fast moving skiing with very nice results. I have created several impressive Stitched mountain panorama.
Only short fall is camera surface is very slick and hard to handle with cold fingers. A textured surface would be a big improvement.

We are very happy that we again choose Canon.

<Content>I bought this to get a faster shutter response than my old Kodak. It delivered. I see reviews about the on/off button. It is a little hard to push, but I dont want to accidently hit it. No problem to me. I did have an odd problem when I first bought it with a line through some pictures. I finally decided it was the fact I was using it skiing in Montana at -10 degrees. Havent seen a problem since.</Content>

<Content>After using a Powershot S50 for the last few years, I saw my step-sisters Elph when she came to visit.  It was so much smaller, but the pictures also came out a lot better.  So I decided that I needed to look into a new compact digital camera.  Finally my S50 got stolen, so I had to find a new one.

I spent a lot of time looking around at different options (mostly focused on Canon).  The other brands I looked at did not have the combination of greater than 4x optical zoom and a viewfinder (for when it is too sunny to see the LCD).  Also the other Canon models did not fit what I wanted.

I needed a small camera that would easily fit in my pants pocket (so I could have it with me almost all the time).  I needed something with better than average optical zoom.  Im often wanting to take pictures of animals, waves, surfing, etc that require more than 3x optical zoom.

As always the more megapixels the better.  So after much searching, this was the obvious choice for the camera that I needed.  I had found the camera at a number of shops in Peru while I had been traveling and looking at options.  But when I came back to the US to make my purchase, I couldnt find the camera anywhere.  I checked Circuit City, Best Buy, Walmart, Sams, and many other local shops.  They all had the typical 3x zoom standard models, but never the SD890IS.  

I had to travel the next day so there was no time for me to order online.  I finally ended up driving an hour to Sams Club in another city to get it.  What a pain.

Since getting the camera I have been nothing but pleased.  We just took it to the Bahamas and took over 625 shots with it.  I am so impressed with the Image Stabilizing (IS) feature.  Many times I was moving (on a boat or something) or got bumped (in a crowd) right as the picture went off, but the pictures all came out just perfectly!  I didnt really consider this feature much when searching for cameras, but it has become one of my favorite things out this camera.

The zoom is exactly what I needed.  I was able to capture so many more great shots with it.  Also the IS feature makes the digital zoom actually usable.  My old S50 had to be on a tripod (or rock) to take a decent photo with the digital zoom.  

I was able to get some crazy pictures with the combo of these features.  Things like the bar code numbers off of a soda can from someone across the park.  I was even able to read them on the LCD of the camera.

I couldnt have chosen a better camera.  I wouldnt recommend it if all you do is take pictures of your friends/family in your house/dorm.  But if you are going to be out on the ocean, in the woods, or anything else where some extra zoom is required and a ultra compact is needed, get it!</Content>

<Content>Amazons listing of the retail price is somewhat misleading, as Canon originally pegged the SD890 at 400 dollars to support its 10 megapixel / 5X optical zoom rating.  But public sentiment didnt support the pricing, and consequently the 890 is going for less than the SD880, which came out at a hundred less than the 890 but is now commanding 50 more.  The reason? The 890 uses an entirely plastic body, which makes it stand out in shape and style from the rest of the Canon SD line, giving it a plumpish, squat-like appearance compared to the classic Canon box-like design.  The 880 costs more and has a less powerful zoom, but its key components are metal.  If the 880 is still too pricey for you, Steves Cameras recommends the SD770 over the 890, remarking that the LCD screen of the latter proved scratch-prone, but dont expect to find a 5-power zoom for less than the current asking price for the 890.</Content>

<Content>Pros: 

Bright LCD, 
Lightweight/Portable, 
Durable, 
Quick startup time

Cons: 

Poor image quality, 
Poor Low-Light Performance, 
Blurry indoor pictures,
Bad auto modes

Almost impossible to take a good indoors shot.

This camera could use firmware updates like nobodys business. The lens is good for this type of camera, but the camera is simply trying to zig when it should zag in almost all modes when indoors.

I used this camera to take what I thought should have been slam dunk easy two-shots at a jiu-jitsu seminar. In auto-mode the camera was always choosing the wrong iso. Combine that with shutter lag and most pics were blurry and not what I wanted.

Given I own canon 20d and 5d SLRs, I thought Id set my expectations sufficiently low with a point and shoot. Unlike every other canons Ive owned and worked with, this one is a loser.

Yes, I can coax reasonable pictures if I use the non-auto modes and force the iso settings to be something appropriate, but for something which should be able to take a good pic of grandma when you flip it on, it misses the mark.

As of 2/2/2009, canon doesnt list firmware updates, so Im stuck with this thing being near uselesss indoors for the time being.

<Content>One of the most versatile point-and-shoots on the market. It has a handful of modes to play around with (the color swap is my personal favorite). Very nice, clean looking finish. Its compact, yet for its size, it doesnt feel flimsy at all. Its a bit heavier than it looks, which is better for maintaining a steady hand while shooting. However this really isnt an issue with this camera since it has image stabilization, a must for Starbucks fanatics. It also comes with the tried, tested, and true optical view-finder, handy when in a battery pinch. The shutter speed is fine, hardly any delay at all. Once you turn it on, youll never miss a moment. The main appeal of this camera however is its 5X zoom function. Of course it is still a compact point-and-shoot, but the function works better than expected from a camera of this price range, i.e. crisp zoom shots, although occasionally a bit blurry at max. Well, I dont mean to cheapen it, it really provides some amazing results. On a side note, for some reason I cant help but feel a bit more macho every time I zoom in to take a shot and my lens protrudes more than any other camera around...I dont know why.

The only major flaw this camera has, which is far from fatal, is its generic looking/feeling on/off button. Yes, this minor imperfection still deserves its own paragraph and a star as well. First of all, for a button that holds such great importance, it is quite illusive. It took me fifteen seconds to find it, and once I did, I sort of wish I hadnt. Its made of cheap plastic that illuminates a hideous green when powered on. It really stands out as the only blemish on this fine piece of technology. Interesting choice for Canon to do such a thing on a camera this high up in their point-and-shoot ranks. Maybe they should have included some sort of stylus type thingy for us to poke around with. Sometimes I fear that I wont be able to turn the camera on in time for that classic shot, and that when I do manage to maneuver my pinky just right, I might not be able to ever power it off again. But hey, I might not have to since taking pictures with this camera is an experience indeed.

Disregard that last paragraph. My girlfriend says I just have fat fingers.</Content>

<Content>A week before leaving for a once in a lifetime trip around the world with National Geographic, my pocket size point and shoot camera broke.  I purchased a replacement on amazon immedialy (during rush season, Christmas).  

The seller contacted me to inform me the camera was not in stock but recommended this camera and said it could be shipped out next day at no extra cost!  Without having much choice due to time constraints I took the recommendation.

I am so grateful for the recommendation as the camera was easy to use and took the most beautiful pictures.  This camera was only used as a pocket camera to my SLR but I ended up using it even more than my SLR as I was much more comfortable with the ease of shooting, the zoom as well as the quality of pictures.

I took over 2500 pictures with this camera and I can honestly say that they all look like a professional photographers work! 

I really owe the supplier much thanks for recommending this camera in place of my original requested order!  I sent the supplier a link to all my wonderful pictures.  This made my trip of a lifetime something I shall never forget!</Content>

<Content>Could not have purchased a better camera!!!  I received it in less than 24 hours and started using it immediately (Dec 23, 08).  I took over 120 pictures in just over 10 days during Christmas with my family and found the speed (for the next shot) to be superb; with or without the flash.  Purchased a 4G 150x sd card at the same time and this enhanced the speed of as well. Fits in my shirt pocket or pants without any bother or trouble.  This Canon SD890IS is a great purchase for anyone if they are looking for a great camera.  Only thing that I found to be a bother was the on/off switch; took a few tries to get the hang of it but I finally got it turned on and it became easier as I began to use it more.  Could use some better engineering by Canon.  </Content>

<Content>Ill let some of the other reviewers and professionals talk about the technical aspects of this camera because I never got that far. This is not to say that its a bad product but there are some major issues, especially for right-handed people and thats why Im sending mine back:

The right side of the camera has a smooth rounded shape. It looks pretty nice but its also the side that I grip and it makes the body much too think to get a good grip. It always feels like the camera is going to fall out of my hand.

It also feels very different than many of the other compact/ultra-compact canon powershot cameras. I think that the body is made if plastic and it feels a little cheap. The power button is also different than most cameras and doesnt give good tactile feedback when pressing it. This seems to be a common complaint.</Content>

<Content> I bought this camera in July 2008 after I accidentally washed (and dried) my previous Powershot (SD600 Digital ELPH, which is also a good camera). It does not take professional photos, however it does take outstanding amateur photos. I took pictures at a concert from the 13th row and had amazing pictures to show for it. With the zoom, some pictures from the concert looked like I was in the front row. Overall, the Canon Powershot SD890IS has more than satisfied my need for a simple point-and-shoot camera. </Content>

<Content>This camera does all that it advertises.  The only problem I have experienced is a delay for the flash to charge.  I did not expect this with a lithium ion battery.  The delay can be about 5 seconds so it is not that bad and it only occurs on rare occasions, such as when the battery is running low.  The extra zoom is great.  The LCD shows noise when panning but it is crystal clear when the picture is taken and when reviewing the pictures.  The scene mode navigation is a little cumbersome with the wheel but it works.  The view finder is a nice feature.  The face detection works well.  The included software is pretty good.  Reading some of the manual is handy but not necessary.  It helps you understand all the capabilities of the camera.  The picture review modes are great, face focus gives you a blown up version of the face of one of the people in the shot as well as the entire picture.  Great camera for $260 (on sale).  Spare batteries are cheap too $12!  </Content>

<Content>I just received the camera, but after having inspected it once, it was enough for me to put it back in the original box for a return. Id read a number of both professional and user reviews before I bought this camera, but it seems that my research was based solely on picture quality and performance while leaving out other important things like finish and design. Although before my purchase I did notice a couple of reviewers complaining about a flimsy, cheap power button that came with this model, having owned many canons before, I quickly disregarded them as the voice of nitpickers who always found something to complain about. It turns out that wasnt the case. The problem was quite real. The button, which is designed differently from other canon models that I know of, feels completely loose and broken. Theres absolutely no firmness to it and feels like its just sitting there. You dont get any resistance or tactile feedback when you press it. Now this has happened to one more customer who purchased this camera. Please do take heed.</Content>

<Content>I have been using this camera for about 4 months. This is the 4th (digital) Canon I have purchased, preceded by a rebel and two elph models for family members. The two features that led me to select this are the 5x zoom and the viewfinder. I dont find the viewfinder to be particularly accurate for framing the picture. On the other hand, I dont find the screen to be a particularly accurate rendering of colors or focus. You usually dont have time to fiddle back and forth, after fiddling with the other scene, flash, etc. Go with one and just keep taking pics until you find the balance and focus you like. Its not like you are wasting film.
There are two things that really annoy me about this camera and prevented me from giving it 5 stars. One is the long delay between pushing the button and actually taking the picture. For example, a child or animal will probably move before the camera actually takes the shot, unless they are asleep or focused on something else. Part of it is red eye reduction, but even when you turn off flash, it is still way too long. Kind of like make an appointment to snap the shutter. The other frustration is the outer ring on the navigation control (not the top wheel, the one that changes scene or selects flash). I find I have to spin that thing around a lot before it actually changes the selection and then it may change by 1, 2 or even three options. So you are spinning the stupid wheel back and forth back and forth just to -- say -- turn off the flash so the cat wont turn its head while you are waiting for the camera to actually take the picture. Cat gets up and leaves. So you need to make those changes in advance before you even start framing. And that means you need to learn the camera quirks so you know its limits in advance.
The general setting minus flash is good for most pics. The night and indoor options are pretty good as well, minus flash. The flash is what you would expect, pretty short distance, so it is nice that the camera can still take many pictures without it, given adequate ambient light.
There is substantial barrel distortion at 5x, but I expect that with a camera this small. With the good resolution, cropping is an option.
It does have a rather odd algorithm for selecting what it wants to focus on when people are not the subject or there are a lot of other subjects around. It seems to want to find something in the foreground - anything, instead of using the obvious high contrast horizon.  An old fashioned infinity setting would be nice then you could use the older canon feature of using one area to represent light, contrast balance and then changing the view to something else. When it doesnt find a match in those little boxes, it isnt happy. 
My camera makes some really weird almost grinding sounds and the lens spends a lot of time trying to find focus when I am in the 4 to 5x range. Makes the same sound when I turn it off, too. Not sure if that is normal. Again, the time to set up the shot and actually take the shot is too long for a point and shoot camera. More like shoot and point, if you get my drift. In that respect, I like the SD600 more.
Nice camera, generally a decent balance of features, function and the physical constraints of the design. I guess I just expected more from Canon.</Content>

<Content>I LOVE this camera... This is the fifth camera I have owned in the last five years (I tend to break them) My first camera was a Nikon coolpix which I liked cause it was easy but the picture quality wasnt amazing... My second camera was a pentax optio which I did really like... when that broke I replaced it with the new pentax optio and i HATED it!!!  Then I got the cute purple Nikon coolpix and even though I didnt break that one I did return it because it took the blurriest/worst pictures... My dad convinced me to look at Canons even though I never really wanted one... He loves his canon so I thought what do I have to lose... I researched it on the internet and this camera had some awesome reviews... I went ahead and purchased it and I am so glad my dad had me look into canons... They have amazing features and take awesome pictures!!! i have so far loved everything about this camera (except the design, but you get over that when you see the high quality photos it produces) So my suggestion to everyone is look around... But I love my canon and am so glad I got it since I had horrible experiences with the pentax optio and the nikon coolpix!!!</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera and I returned it after couple of days because I thought the design was really bad, The ON/OFF button is weird and the camera was heavy. I did not take pictures that I thought were extraordinary; the picture quality was very normal.
I wanted a camera that is small so I can carry it everywhere and also easy to use, which is not the case of the SD890IS.
The zoom feature is good and that is the only good thing about the camera.
I would advise anybody who is considering this camera to check it out in the store first, hold it with your hands and make sure you are comfortable with it before you can decide.

<Content>I bought this camera after reading so many reviews on various available Canon Powershots and also specifically on 890IS. I decided to get this one as opposed to others because of its extra zoom (5X). And I think its worth it; power of canon powershot with extra zoom; works like charm. I recently returned from my trip to Hawaii and I cant even complain about the picture quality. We did the helicopter tour of Kauai and some of the pictures I took with 5X zoom are amazing  looks like we are like feet away from the spot! I recommend this camera if you really need 5X zoom and other canon features. If you can do with out zoom then you can look for other options!</Content>

<Content>I was really impressed with the photos I look with this camera.  The image stabilization works really well and the presets are worth using.  I have a two year old so the size is nice and easy to use.  My first impression of the camera itself was average.  It seemed like the housing was not the same quality as my previous canon and the on off button was very difficult to use.  But after only 45 days of owning it (using it maybe a handful of times) the lens has stuck open and extended!  Lens error!  I have since heard this is a common problem... well now I wait for amazons return department.  I think I would get a different camera this next time.</Content>

<Content>The Canon PowerShot Sd89OIS is a very capable little digital camera.  Its generous 10 megapixel resolution, combined with a sharp zoom lens provides excellent images and accurate colors.  My only complaint is the tiny size of the power (on-off) button. Although I have small hands I have great difficulty accessing the button to turn on the camera. To help alleviate this problem I glued onto the button a rectangular piece of plastic to provide a raised surface, and it has proven to be of great help.  However, theres no excuse why such an important button should be so inaccessable.</Content>

Within 10 seconds of taking this baby out of the box, i knew i had a winner! The start up time is great, image quality is superb, and the video quality is jaw-dropping amazing! 

I was torn between this unit, and the 770 i think? The different being the other one had the 3 screen i really really wanted, but lacked zoom. This unit has a slightly smaller screen but the zoom really makes up for it. Id have hated myself if i was limited to a 3x optical and no digital zoom.

<Content>I wanted a camera that could capture pictures of my 2 year old son in action.  Although its not quite as fast as I want it, its way better than the 2 year old sony camera that I was using.  The image stabilizer really helps with my shaky hand and the face detection thing is pretty cool too. Im totally a novice photographer, so I just wanted a basic camera that takes nice pictures...and this does the trick for me.  The only minor issues I have with the camera are the numerous functions that its capable of.  Being that Im too lazy to read the manual, when I accidentally hit buttons that changes a setting, Im usually at a lost as to how to fix it.  The buttons are also a bit awkward, so for someone with big hands, this might be somewhat difficult to use.  Overall, great camera for the price! </Content>

I find it takes great pictures, and so far the image stabilization feature has given me excellent and sharp pictures, even at low light levels.
The camera has many more features than I will ever use, but I particularly like the large screen and the optical viewfinder.  If I were to offer any criticism, I would like to see the instruction manual be enlarged (it is 230 pages) with more instructions on how to use the advanced features.
Nicely built, small size, and the battery really lasts.  The 5X optical zoom is a great feature.</Content>

<Content>My family has purchased, over the years, several versions of this camera starting the first Elph version about five years ago. I have a Canon XT also and multiple lenses and do a lot of amateur photography. We have been really happy with our Canon equipment. Its not as flashy with all the bells and whistles of some of the other manufacturers but the quality is good and the firm reliable. 

We were going to Italy and France for two weeks and I didnt want to lug around all the XT lenses.  We were determined to both carry laptops but NOT check luggage and so really needed to minimize the camera equipment. We would be on planes, trains, buses and partly on foot (we stayed three nights in Careno, Italy, a pedestrian only village in Lake Como). 

I searched through the various Elphs and picked this one for the 5x zoom and image stabilization features. We carried along the cameras USB cord to download photos to the laptop, an extra battery and the battery charger and that was it. Oh, a little plug adapter for European wall plugs (the battery charger works in Europe so you dont need a converter, just the wall adapter). The setup is much like earlier Elphs so the learning curve was easy. I didnt discover until quite late that there was a wide-angle option on the camera and wished I had realized that earlier. 

We took almost 1,000 photos with in on the trip. The quality of the photos is great, and the ability to slip the camera into a pocket such a plus. Well be carrying this little baby along on other trips and Ill save the big one for stationary visits.     </Content>

<Content>This PowerShot SD890IS is fantastic! I took several pictures while we were driving on the high way at 75 MPH, and the pictures turned out to be fine, just like I took them when I was standing on the ground. Also it offers several special modes which are very useful. I cant imagine that it could take clear pictures of firework and sunset! I bought a SD600 before, that one couldnt take pictures of firework at all. But SD890IS is great! All most like a professional camera!
One disadvantage is that the battery runs out very fast, I have to recharge it everyday. And if I choose the largest size of the photos, the files are too big and fill up the memory card very soon. I had to change the picture size to M2. </Content>

<Content>I needed a new camera, and using the info on Canons website, I decided between the 890IS and the 720IS.  Because this camera wasnt yet available, I went to Walmart and bought the 720.  It was a huge waste of money and time.  It sucked power out of the batteries like no other camera Ive used.  After reading a few reviews on Amazon and other camera websites, I took the plunge and paid $349.99 for it.  It went down to about $306 within the first 30 days of purchase, and Amazon refunded me the difference from the $349.99.  

This camera takes EXCELLENT photos!  There is a bit of a learning curve, but the book is very helpful.  The 5X zoom is great, and the macro is superb.  I bought the high-power flash to accompany it, and I feel like Im set for any situation.  The image stabilization is also fantastic.  I took photos of a train moving south while we drove north and still got great pics.  You know how hard it is with kids sometimes, but this camera captures them well.  

People have complained a bit about the on/off button, but its just a matter of getting used to.  The camera is really small, but packed with power.  I still have to explore some of the other features, but thus far, its definitely worth every penny.  You wont be disappointed!

<Content>This is one of the best cameras that I have ever laid my hands on.  It is very simple to use and has a LOT of features that you can play with to create great creative images.

I like the fact that it has an optical viewfinder.  The optical viewfinder is very useful when you are outdoor and the sun is bright.  It will be very hard to view ANY LCD screen in this condition.  Because it has the optical viewfinder, the LCD screen is slightly smaller than most of its competitors; it only has 2.5 compared to 3 on some other cameras.

The slight UI issue that I have is the LAG that the wheel has.  If you turn it too slow, it does not change the option or change the option VERY slowly.  But, if you turn the wheel too fast, there is a LAG before the option changes.  So, sometimes, you need to go back and forth a few times to get to the option that you want.

Oh yeah...  The multiple frames shot is only available WITHOUT flash.  This is true for most point-and-shoot cameras.

In conclusion, this is an excellent compact camera.  I carry this camera wherever I go.  And, the battery life on this camera is not too shabby at all.  The longest that I have ever experienced with any compact point-and-shoot cameras.

<Content>This is the 5th Canon Ive owned. I generally love their overall quality and function.  I agree with most of the rave reviews about this camera, but I have TWO IMPORTANT CAVEATS that dont seem to appear.

1st: The orientation of the LCD polarization on the screen is such that when using the camera with polarized sunglasses, you cant see an image on the LCD (in the standard,  horizontal position). For every other LCD camera Ive used the screen is 100% viewable with polarized sunglasses. The blanking out of the screen only occurs when you rotate the camera 90 degrees (to the vertical orientation).

2nd: There is CONSIDERABLE Barrel distortion when using this long 5x optical zoom lens in the standard mode.

Please note: Ive contacted Canon Customer Service and they say both issues are not fixable and expected given the design of the camera (UGH!)</Content>

<Content>beware if you are purchasing this camera because of all of the special features, such as the zoom or digital macro.  I took this camera on vacation  discovered that there are some pretty strict limitations on the functionality of these features.  Such as, in digital macro you must practically place the lens on what you are photographing to have it in focus...but then the item does not fit the frame properly, and is partly cut off in the final image.  The zoom function RADICALLY loses focus the farther you zoom.  The manual does address both these issues, but doesnt solve them, just states they are there.  My basic photos of family turned out very nicely, but my close up foliage shots, zoomed shots, sunsets, etc were not as good as would be expected, especially since I was using a tripod for many of these shots.  That being said, I found the camera  functions very easy to use  understand, and its very compact  lightweight.  </Content>

<Content>I did a lot of research before I picked this camera; every site recommended cannon. Sony, casio all had picture problems. I picked this camera because it has a 5x optical zoom, low light feature, compactness, and the buttons are not close to one another so easy to use if you have big fingers.

Camera is loaded with features but not all are easy to get to if you have big hands that is my one downside of this camera. Changing to some manual setting can be a challenge and finding where to review pictures as well.  Did not think I would like the face detection feature but I was pleasntly surprized, it does a great job find the face except if you have sunglasses on. The faces come out great in the picture; 10 MP may be an overkill but I like sometimes like to crop and enlarge  certain parts of the picture and hanve 10 MP makes sure the picture is not grainy.  Lastly night pictures without the flash come out good not excellent but very good;although it does take a min to change all of the settings for low light mode. The software it comes with is okay, if you are really into photography I sugguest buy another package.</Content>

(However, that is fixable in the software on ones computer.)  Buy a FAST, LARGE SD card to go with, as you will be playing with this camera TONS, and the included SD card will fill up WAY too fast.  (SD cards that come with cameras are ALWAYS too small.)  You can buy one on Amazon here for NICE and cheap :-)  I bought the Kingston Class 4, 4 GB Card and L-O-V-E it :-)  )4GB SDHC Class 4 Flash Card</Content>

Telephoto shots are good and clear, thanks to the great Image Stabilization. I even get really good images of moving vehicles, thanks to the Motion Detection. I charged the battery when I got it, and it is still going strong after I have taken at least a hundred photos. The SD890IS is a fine camera. I love it!</Content>

<Content>This is the 4th Canon I have owned and my 3rd Elph...
Let me start by saying nothing can replace my SD 700 which I lost...
4x optical zoom, buttons were all in a good location, compact camera and LIGHT!! If they made the same camera with more mega pixels I would buy it in a second (even though the 6.3MP took very crisp pictures)
I purchased the SD 1100 and returned it 2 days later... I hated it. Zoom was awful pictures came out awful. I replaced it with a SD850
OK camera. Much heavier than the SD700, same zoom, buttons not as convenient, very good picture quality... basically as close to the SD 700 as you can get with all the Elphs that are out there. Has an additional feature that lets you turn light specs (such as Christmas lights into stars and hearts)
After 2 months I saw the SD 890 and had to have it...
Pros: Camera is much lighter
Zoom is AMAZING!! 
I do like the review button they put on the camera
Cons: The placement of the buttons suck. 
It is hard to turn the camera on 
I dont like were the wheel is places
Body is larger than SD 700

All in all any of the above mentioned Elphs are GREAT. They take pictures a lot faster than any other camera. There is hardly any delay. The pictures are crisp and the colors are vibrant. I have only had the 890 for a few days and I am hoping it will live up to the SD 700 standards.

<Content>I was looking for another Canon camera to replace my SD700IS and couldnt find anything with comparable optics in that model. I found out about the new SD890IS but couldnt find anyone who had it available online or in a retail store within 120 miles of me. Google pointed me to Amazon who I would not have thought of for buying a camera, and not only did they have it in stock, but for less than the cost of gas, plus not having to waste a day traveling, I had the camera within 24 hours. It was also $50 cheaper than the online sites who had it on back order. Im very pleased with the camera which has all the features of my old one, plus 5X optical and 10MP which is an upgrade from the 4X  6MP of the SD700IS. Both Macro and Telephoto images are very impressive for a camera small enough to be constantly carried around with me on my belt. It has a large enough selections of modes to handle most situations. I also like its movie capabilities. At a commencement exercise a couple of weeks ago I was able to get some surprisingly decent pictures under the circumstances without using a flash, because I was able to use a very high ISO and could match the type of available indoor lighting. This compact camera has a lot of capabilities.</Content>

<Content>As a travel writer I spend a lot of time at Walt Disney World, and Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs are the most common cameras I see. Families seem to love them, because theyre so easy to carry and operate. About the size of a deck of playing cards, each of these pocket cameras really do slip right into a pants pocket, and their rectangular designs make them easy to grip. Best of all, they all take good photos. (How do I know? Because Ive actually gotten to use every one of these models. Nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs.)

Heres my breakdown of the ten bestselling Digital Elph models. Any of the first six are superb choices:

1ST PLACE: SD1100 IS 
An update to the SD1000 (see below), this 2008 8MP beauty adds image stabilization, a slightly longer zoom (38-114 mm), another MP of photo size and a small indent on the right side for a better grip. Plus it comes in colors! My daughter has a blue one and uses it every single day. During school days the image stabilization made a real difference in her on-the-bus shots. With that heavy of use hers has gotten scratched up a bit, but the marks are small and hardly noticeable.

2ND PLACE: SD870 IS
The ELPH to buy if you want a wide-angle lens. Slightly thicker than the SD1100 IS, this 8MP model doesnt have an optical viewfinder which makes it tough to use in bright sunlight, otherwise theres little not to love. My husband uses one as a comp camera, to compose shots for the travel guide The Complete Guide to Walt Disney World.

3RD PLACE: SD770 IS 
Just released in May, this 10 MP model is, in a way, an update of the SD1100 IS (see above). I rate it lower because it costs about $50 more and doesnt come in colors. On the other hand, it has a longer battery life than the 1100 and features an improved LCD screen that is very easy to view. As for photo quality, I cant tell the difference.

4TH PLACE: SD950 IS
Theres a lot to like in this 12.1 MP camera. First off, its gorgeous. The body, though a little thick, is titanium. An upgrade to the SD850 IS (see below), it has a 3.7x zoom lens and adds manual controls as well as the ability to stitch together panoramic images. The only reason I dont rate it higher is the price.

5TH PLACE: SD890 IS (The camera on this page)
Want a long zoom lens? Heres your baby, a 2008 10 MP model with a 5x zoom. Also has the new bright LCD screen and all the other 2008 Canon goodies. The most expensive Canon PowerShot ELPH.

6TH PLACE: SD790 IS
With the same 10 MP image sensor and 3x zoom lens as the SD770 IS, this 2008 model stands out only for its larger 3-inch LCD display and, as a result, lack of optical viewfinder. The rear controls are different, too, with a flatter design that uses fewer buttons.

7TH PLACE: SD1000
In my opinion theres no reason to buy this 7.1 MP model. Released in 2007, its been replaced by the SD1100 IS (see above). The SD1000 is a fine camera but it doesnt have image stabilization, a key feature of the 2008 lineup.

8TH PLACE: SD850 IS
The ancestor to the SD890 IS, this 8 MP Elph combines a 4x zoom and 8 MP photo size with an image stabilizer. Every button, dial and switch has a quality feel. Slighter larger than the other models here, it is a little tougher to pop in and out of your pocket, but if you have larger hands it may be just what you are looking for.

9TH PLACE: SD800 IS
This 7.1 MP predecessor to the 870 doesnt focus well at its edges when set at its widest angle. Unless its priced really cheap, get the 870 instead.

10TH PLACE: SD750
The 2007 PowerShot flagship offers a light meter that adjusts for facial brightness, 17 shooting modes, some first-rate movie features and red-eye correction -- features that were innovative a year ago but are common in Canons latest models. No image stabilization; no optical viewfinder. Choose a 2008 model instead.</Content>

<Content>Pros: image quality, shutter speed, amazing zoom, fast power on, lots of advanced features, etc. etc.  The technical specs, and performance of this camera far exceeded any expectations that I could have expected from a pocket-sized camera.

Cons (All minor):
1) Charging requires the removal of the battery from the camera, and it being inserted into a separate battery charger.  Im accustomed to my old sony camera, where it charges in its own cradle.

2) The power button itself requires some precision to activate.  Its not difficult, or annoying to use, but again, Im comparing it to my older sony camera, where it was a quick, simple flip.

3) The menuing system can be somewhat daunting to a new or novice user.  Depending what mode your camera is in will change what menu options youre presented with.  Using the camera  reading the manual will help with the familiarity process.

4) The spin dial (or whatever its called).  I have yet to see what benefit this dial has over the conventional directional pad.  Its almost like a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, its quite helpful when you want to quickly flip through photos youve taken on the camera.  On the other hand, it becomes challenging when trying to change scenes in scene mode, or when changing functions in the manual mode.


Overall, I love this camera.  I bought it just before going on vacation, and was continually amazed by the quality of the photos and shutter speed performance throughout the trip.  While traveling on a tour bus, I was able to take crystal clear photos of the countryside landscape, while the bus was traveling at about 60mph.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera to take on a trip to China.  It was great.  The zoom goes to 20x and the motion stabilization means that the pictures are very clear - no blurring due to a bouncing or moving hand. 
I took snaps in a theater w/o flash and they came out clear and bright.
Auto focus processing is about .5 secs.  Image storage processing can take about 3 to 5 secs.
The battery is good for about 250 pictures.  I didnt test for movie duration.  
Im very pleased with this camera.
My girlfriend bought the SD750 and she is jealous of the pictures my camera takes.

<Content>Im a Big fan of Canon products-(own a Canon Powershot Pro S5 and 20D), so you can understand why I was a bit shy about this purchase-wanting convenience without risking quality.  I elected to try the Canon SD890IS because of the 10M with 5X Optical.  Some talk about the surface getting dinged up but whats happening to mark their equipment so badly?  This small but wonderful camera has all the quality and capability of  my Canon Powershot Pro S5, with the exception of shooting as well in low light, but even that is not bad.  And remember the reasons you purchased an elph. Others brands may have higher mega pixels, but comparing this camera with its one slight short fall that I noticed, it out shines the other brands in low light shooting capability, does better with noise problems, and macro capability! The size is great, again, fitting the need I required-something smaller.   If you are looking for quality, ease of use, than consider the Canon SD890IS.  </Content>

Although it is small it packs a powerful punch.  The pictures are amazing.  I have taken pictures that are just as good as some top SLR cameras.  The on-off button is a little small and it makes a scratching noise when you zoom, but those are minor problems.  The picture quality alone makes up for its cons.  I have tried other point and shoot models and brands and nothing comes close. </Content>

<Content>Another great Canon Camera

Pros-
*5x Zoom gives you a closer shot than a typical point and shoot
*Control dial is similar to iPod touch wheel
*Selection modes arranged better (Auto, Manual, SCN, Video). The Playback is separate and easier to access
*Start up time immediate
*Little lag between shots
*Optical viewfinder

Cons-
*Shape of camera can make it hard to hold one handed
*Metal finish has a few scuffs already from only a weeks use
*Somewhat Pricey


I personally think its a great camera for a basic traveler/camera buff who wants just a little more than a basic point and shoot. I needed it now, but it probably would have been wise to wait a few months for the price to come down.

<Content>First impressions of the camera is that it looks cheap.  Im not sure if this was done to save costs or lower the camera weight but the body appears cheap compared to the SD950IS.  Considering it costs more I would expect them to put some more into the body.  The zoom feature is nice but I rarely need to zoom in that much.  I need more wide-angle if possible.  I really like the circular wheel.  Its not as sensitive as the touch wheel on the SD950IS which I seem to hit by accident.  The power button is a bit tough to turn on/off but thats good and bad.  At least it wont go on by accident in your pocket.  The body is much easier to hold than the SD950IS which because of its design feels like my fingers are blocking the lens/flashlight/sensor.

Overall, I like the product but would expect this to cost about $50 less than the SD950IS.</Content>

<Content>After suffering with a Sony CyberShot and a short-lived Olympus, I read an enormous number of owner reviews of cameras before selecting this one.  The pictures are superior, particularly in low light and taken by someone who relies on a good point-and-shoot camera.  I must say that the battery life is just ridiculously short. Using freshly purchased (and I checked - no where near expiring) batteries, and trying two different brands (separately, not mixed), I find that the batteries last for maybe 30 shots before I start getting the flashing icon warning me that they are about to die.  I put in fresh batteries as I arrived at my childs school function, and the warning light was flashing within two hours.  Note the camera was not on for two hours.  This is nuts!  I love everything else about the camera, but cant imagine walking around with a backpack full of batteries to get through a five day vacation. </Content>

<Content>the aperture can be open up to 2.8!
the large aperture provides clear foreground and blurred background which distinguishes the shot subject from surroundings.
it performs well when picturing a portrait or detailed feature.
this might be the greatest advantage of sx110 over other 10x compact digital cameras whose aperture almost start from 4.x(smaller aperture).
it is however a little bit heavy and big sized. I still like it.

<Content>I bought this camera to take with me to a concert I went to back in february.  I knew that I was in the 6th row, so I needed a good zoom, and I needed something with fairly low noise at high ISOs because of the indoor lighting.  I also needed something that was fairly low in price.

After much searching I decided on this little gem of a camera, and boy am I glad I did!

Some of the things I love about this camera:

Its compact.  I was looking at the sx10is which is a bit of an upgrade, but ultimately the compactness of the 110 won me over.

Its inexpensive.  At least as far as cameras go.  I make very little money with my part time job, so I was looking for something that wouldnt break the bank and for about $[...] you cant argue with this.

You can set most everything manually.  This came in great handy at the concert when I needed a quicker shutter speed than the pre-set settings wanted to give me.  I also like knowing that I can control the image instead of just pushing a button and hoping for the best.

Beautiful 3in screen.  Very lovely to use and very clear.

Manual flash.  I hate hate hate built in flash for anything other than when youre taking a quick snapshot of you and a friend at night, so this was very convenient for me.  I could flip up the flash when I wanted it, and when I didnt it would stay down. 

Pretty nice in low lighting.  At the concert there was very little light on stage so I cranked the ISO up to 800 and was happy with the amount of noise.  It was still there, but it wasnt distracting like on some other cameras.  Heres a picture I took from the 6th row with no flash

[...]

This set was taken at a different concert with ISO and shutter speed set manually 

[...]

Nice video quality.  I wasnt sure of the video quality when I bought it and was hoping for the best at my concert where I know lots of videos get overwhelmed with the bass.  Luckily, it didnt sound like a bomb was going off at every beat.  The sound isnt as good (in my opinion) as the sx10, but its still pretty good.  The video is also pretty high quality.  

If youre interested, you can find some videos I took here

[...]

10x optical zoom.  I.  Love.  This.  The whole trip I took while seeing the concert was filled with me playing around with the zoom from our 9th story hotel room.  There was a group of police officers talking with a man directly across the street from our hotel and you could literally read their name badges from how close it could zoom in.

Now for some things that I dont like so much.

First of all, the screen has no protection so its easily scratched if its not in a case whenever its not being used.  This is a turn off for me only because Im the kind of person who likes to throw stuff into my bag and be on my way without worrying about it getting scratched up, or having to worry about the bulkiness of a case.  This is by no means a reason to not buy the camera as this problem is easily remedied by keeping the camera in a small case or using a screen protector.  

Next is that you cant use the optical zoom while taking movies.  This bothers me because I really like to take video at concerts and its a pain if you set the zoom wrong at the beginning of a video and cant change it throughout.  

On that note, its also VERY easy to switch from standard video mode to compact mode.  Compact mode is a considerably lower resolution than standard and is closer to the resolution on a camera phone than the much higher quality of the standard mode.  This has happened to me on at least two occasions and I couldnt figure out how it was happening until too late.  It can easily change if the wheel located near the right thumb is moved while the camera is in movie mode.  This is the one flaw that is causing me to give the camera 4 stars instead of 5 (Im still bitter about the footage I lost because of it).  This, however, can become a non problem if youre aware of how it can happen and how to fix it if it does happen.

To wrap this up, the sx110is is an excellent camera if you want an awesome zoom, and good quality images on a budget.  I will definitely continue to use this as a non DSLR concert/everyday camera far into the future!</Content>

<Content>I already own another Canon digital but I wanted something with a higher optical zoom. I have been using this for the last few weeks and I love this camera. I noticed that results are much better when you use in manual or program modes. It is not possible to reach the desired results with auto. May be I have not been able to figure that out yet. 

I do not like that it is slow when you want to take continuous shots but it is so easy to use anyway. However, 2 AA Batteries do not last much, you always have to carry backups if you are on the road. Good part is that you can find those everywhere.

<Content>I wanted a camera that was very easy to use yet very versatile. As intuitive as possible and this one fits perfectly. The oversized screen is terrific and the easy knob for selecting  types of picture is quick and convenient. I use my camera for a variety of different situations ranging for travel and outdoor shots to closeup shots of small objects. It focuses quick and does a nice job. 
I really like the tuck away flash. It stays tucked away and if the picture you are taking needs the flash a message will tell you to raise it. 
Picture quality is excellent and the oversized viewing screen is really nice. glad I got this one over a less expensive model. Cost me a few dollars more but worth it. 
This camera has a little bit more heft to it than many other smaller and less expensive cameras and I like that. It has a good feel in your hands. 

Overall an excellent camera, easy to use, good price and very intuitive. Canon has a nice user friendly set of buttons and knobs that are standard across many of their cameras. 

My camera gets a lot of heavy website use and its perfect for me. Connect the camera to a cable then drag and drop the pictures where I want them.  
The drag and drop isnt the only way to transfer pics, just one of the ways and the easiest way for me.

I thought the 10x zoom would be perfect (I tape nail tutorials and makeup tutorials) so I thought it was worth a shot

<Content>Ordered this camera from Amazon just before Christmas 08.  Ive been using Kodak products for the past few years, but my last camera was too clunky and inconvenient to just grab for some quick pictures.  

Image stabilization is really great, and with the manual ISO setting up to 1600, you can get really sharp pictures at a distance without using a flash - great for taking shots of the kids at school functions when theyre a mile away on a stage.  

The video quality is excellent as well, and at 30 fps rivals the quality of my digital video camcorder (also a Canon).  Be sure to get a high capacity, high speed SD card as well.  I purchased with the camera a SanDisk Extreme III Class 6 8GB card and have been impressed with its performance; with this card I can take over 2000 photos at the highest resolution setting and/or 68 minutes of video.  

I also like the fact that the camera uses AA batteries instead of its own proprietary battery.  Im using Rayovac Hybrid rechargeables, and Ive only had to change the batteries once in almost 6 months, and that includes a trip to Florida, plus Christmas and birthday pictures.</Content>

<Content>My old PowerShot (2 pixel, 3x zoom) died and I wanted something like it. Its hard to pick a camera, so I decided since I liked what I had, just wanted more zoom and more pixel, why not stick with Canon PowerShot?  A wise choice.  I am in amateur photography heaven with the choice.

Zoom is all you can handle without tripod. Works good enough to catch the glint on the eye of a deer across our pond.  Details include tongues of baby robins being fed worms before their eyes are open.  Individual hairs on feathers of birds 50-60 feet away.  All with auto-focus point and shoot ease.  And fantastic macro capability on the other end of the spectrum.

Batteries last as long as the 4 required in my last camera, but only takes 2 AAs.  Since I bought a relative inexpensive half-hour battery recharger set, cost of batteries will be free after a month or two of shooting.  Something I recommend. If you travel, then buy batteries to avoid carrying the charger.

No lens replacement capability of a SLR, but I dont need that. One camera fits all my needs, inside and out, landscape and portrait, nature and still life, passive and action shots, in the light or dark.  

AND THIS CANON POWERSHOT FITS IN MY SHIRT POCKET.
Image stabilization great for this grandpa shooting grandkids, flowers, and animals.

The only thing I regret about this camera is the fact that I waited until the other camera died before I made my purchase. If your not a professional, enjoy just taking family, vacation, and nature pictures--THEN THIS IS THE CAMERA YOU WILL BE PLEASED WITH.</Content>

<Content>I have had this camera for several weeks now.  Most recently, I captured several shots of a Coopers Hawk enjoying some rodent dinner in a tree in my back yard.  Using the 10x optical zoom and the full 9MP I took some of my best photos ever.  I have cropped and enlarged several to 8x10 and they are stunning. The controls are logical and easy to use.  The camera feels good in your hands. The only negative I have is that it chews and spits out standard AA batteries in a very short period of time.  Rechargables are the only way to go.         </Content>

<Content>This is the best camera on earth. I bought this camera to create beautiful memories of my daughter growing up. Im mainly leaving this review for people with kids who are wondering if this camera can keep up with taking quick fast shots, without missing out on precious moments.

Fast Camera!!!
This camera has NEVER missed a shot and shes a very quick and fast little two year old. Ive captured every single quick smile, precious pose, and all of her active moments. I do this using the sports mode. In this mode, the camera actually takes the picture the very same instant you press down on the button (no delay whatsoever). In this mode, when shes running, there is no blurryness.

Great Indoor Camera!!!
This camera also takes GREAT indoor pics as well. It is a bit heavier than the little cameras out there....but if you want to sacrifice qaulity and performance...go for a little one.

Outstanding Detail and Zoom qaulity
I wanted something that was powerful, and something that my husband can take to football games, basketball and other sporting events. Thats actually how I sold him on the idea of purchasing this camera. The zoom capability is out of this world. For example, we went to the park the other day and I was able to get pictures of the ducks from the OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE....and in very clear detail. Now thats powerful.

Easy to use!!!
The minute this camera arrived, I took it out of the box and started using it. I didnt even read the instructions...thats how easy it is to use. Im more of a beginner type when it comes to cameras. I popped the batteries in, and went crazy taking pics. The video mode has a dedicated button so you can video events very quickly without fussing with dials.

No Regrets!!!
I hope Ive helped someone out on making their purchase decision. I get compliments all of the time on how fast the camera is and how wonderful the pics look. I love this CAMERA!!! I can tell you that you wont regret this purchase. </Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera after my previous Canon Powershot digital camera was stolen at a construction site.  This is my 3rd Powershot and to say that Canon has a winner in this series would be an understatement.  The current model is a powerhouse.  9 MB file size, a 10x optical zoom giving you the same view as a 550 mm 35 mm camera lens lets you really pull images in from almost any vantage point.  The image stabilizer is also a great tool as there is no visible blurring due to hand shake.  The only issue for a really great camera is battery life.  The first set of batteries, the ones that came with the camera ran out fairly quickly, granted my 10 year son was shooting movies and then reviewing them over and over again, but still. This is the first digital camera that allows for the use of AA batteries off the shelf which in theory shouldbe convenient except that they really dont last very long compared to the rechargable batteries that usually come with these cameras. As a result a sprang for  rechargable batteries and a charger and then batteries seem to last a bit longer.  Only time will tell so we will have to wait and see.

Overall I am very happy with this camera and I think that you will be as well.  Also the black colering is very cool.</Content>

<Content>Except for the latch on the battery compartment, we have been happy with the camera.  My wife prefers the easy-to-hold size. She does not like tiny cameras.  But we started having trouble with power on after changing batteries or switching SD cards.  The problem was the white spring switch on the inside of the battery cover.  When the battery compartment is properly closed the white switch is forced toward the SD card.  For a few months I was able to hold the outside sliding battery cover lock while closing, thus causing the inside white switch to be pushed toward the SD card, allowing power on.  Over time however, even this trick failed.  In desperation, I forced a thinly folded piece of paper behind the inside white switch while holding forward.  I held the paper in place with scotch tape.  We will see how long it lasts.  </Content>

<Content>I like the camera in almost every way.  This is a nice, easy to use, all around camera with some key features.  I like to be able to imprint the date on the photo itself (not just the file name) and this camera has that feature (not supported in many newer cameras).  It supports SD media card so I did not have to get new cards or change formats.  The camera also has great optical zoom and easy to find batteries; accepting two double AA batteries (available almost anywhere).  My biggest issue is that I cannot default the flash to on in average light situations.  Sometimes, in average to low light, the pics may appear grainy due to the less than adequate light (I dont believe that the cameras sensor engages the flash to on even if the flash is ready and up.)  I have not read the book in detail as of yet, so this MAY be a possibility, but I am skeptical.  Otherwise, NO complaints.  Easy to use, good quality, large LCD screen and more.  This is a very nice camera with better than average features (specifically optical zoom and date imprint on image) for the price.  I recommeded it to my dad to buy as a gift for my stepmom I liked it so much.  </Content>

The focussing and exposure decisions that it makes are usually very good and pretty fast, controls are in good positions, picture quality and color quality are high, and stuff works smoothly and well.  I feel the camera was implemented by people who use cameras a lot. Im very happy with this camera.  Just shot 400+ pix in Canyonlands and Goblin Valley in Utah.  Dave Goodale</Content>

<Content>I have been using this for about two weeks. The less than stellar thoughts are around the wait time from flash pic to flash pic. It is no less than a 7 sec wait. this is 2-3 sec longer than the typical compact Powershot smaller cameras SD1100, SD590, etc.

Everything else is all upside. I used it the other day at my daughters soccer game. I sat mid field and took clear close up pics of her in net. Obviously not a regulation size field. 6 yr olds size field.

The movies have been hit or miss on clarity. It is probably a user error as we are still getting to know the camera. 

While it is bigger than our previous Canon SD590 it isnt too big. It fit in the pocket of my shorts. I look forward to understanding the manual controls. Also, the playback features are much improved over our previous Canon.

No plans to use the SW as we use Picasa.</Content>

You have a choice of 3 manual flash settings if you like to use them, a 10x zoom and a 40x digital zoom, a 3 LCD screen, image stabilization and it uses AA batteries which you can find in just about any store if you need to purchase new ones.

<Content>I did a lot of research before settling on this camera -- about 6 weeks worth! After all that, Ive reached the conclusion that most expert camera reviews are mostly written by pros who typically review nuances most of us wont care about.

As the proud parent of a toddler, Im convinced the real test of a cameras capabilities is simply how well does it handle indoor shots of a fast moving toddler?

Well Im happy to report that after 4 weeks of heavy use, this camera performs much better than my old Canon Powershot SD1000 (Elph) camera.  But having said that, it does require a bit of fiddling with camera controls to get GREAT results.  Its not very complicated really, just take plenty of test-shots and see which camera modes work best for your environment:

Maybe youre at a wedding, and youre not allowed to use the flash.  Well, the telephoto zoom lens with good indoor lighting should be fine.  (The zoom lens is a bit slow to fully extend, but once extended...whoa! Amazing clarity!)  I found power-on time acceptable at about 2 seconds.

Maybe you dont want to carry a camcorder, but want the ability to take up to 1 hour-long videos.  Well there are two vides modes , 30 and 15 frames per second.  (I know the Quicktime MOV format is gaining popularity among the HD-video crowd, but I prefer the ease of AVI format which can be easily played/edited on most computers - no additional software required.)

Maybe you want to compare your customized settings with the Canons pre-programmed modes.  Well there are 13 automatic scene modes, plus another 4 traditional manual modes -- and a large crisp LCD screen to view your results.

But maybe, youre like my wife and just want to turn on the camera and start taking pictures.  Well, there are not 1, but 2 auto-modes (one of which is an Easy mode that disables buttons from accidentally being pushed).

The point is that is an incredibly versatile camera.  Smaller to carry than the traditional UltraZoom cameras, but more feature rich than your traditional point-and-shoot cameras.

PS- Forget any negative attention you might read about the battery life.  I put in a couple of rechargeable AA (2650 mAh) batteries, and they lasted for hundreds of shots over 10 days.

It was so easy to use and understand, and downloading the pictures onto the computer was snap. The next week I bought mine.  Since getting it I have taken many pictures-the first test was my 3 year olds birthday party.  Let me tell you, the kids and pets setting on the camera was up to the occassion. I got some great group shots even though they were running around the back deck with our dog. I have since brought it to a concert, a couple trips to the park, and taken Easter portraits.  All of them are clear.  I will never buy anything but a canon again.</Content>

The camera is a very good camera but it it too advanced for me.  Maybe I will learn how to use it to the best advantages but it will take me lots of time.  I already had a Kodak, not as expensive as Canon, but I found that it was a lot easier to use.  I wish I had stayed with Kodak.</Content>

<Summary>Too Much Camera For Me</Summary>
</Review>
<Review>
<DocID>B001EQ4C8U-47</DocID>
<Content>Just came back from 9 week backpacking trip in Asia.  I usually use a Canon DSLR, but could not bring my SLR due to size, weight, worrying about its safety all the time, attracting too much attention, etc.

However, if youre an SLR user like me, you miss all the professional functionality, versatility and most of all, zoom range when you settle for most point-and-shoot (PAS) cameras.

The SX110 IS was my dream come true.  The 10x optical zoom makes all the difference... in 35mm terms you have a max focal length of 360mm -- like carrying a massive zoom lens on an SLR.  Cant count how many beautiful shots would have been impossible if I had been using an 5x zoom or less.

Pros:
- full creative modes (Av, TV, Manual, exposure adjustments) that are actually faster to adjust than my SLR, no fake Manual modes that lots of PASs have, which are anything but Manual
- (its still got all the scene modes, e.g. Landscape, Action, Portrait, etc. and most of the common ones are on the main dial so you dont have to cycle through them onscreen to get them quickly if youre not comfortable with the creative modes)
- lots of white balance options
- you manually flip-up the flash, only when you want to use it... I hate it when cameras automatically decide for me when to pop-up and use the flash (or you have to cycle through the flash buttons to get control of them) ... I know whether I want flash or not dammit... also you can adjust the flash intensity (great for using light flash on daytime shots in the shade) 
- massive and beautiful 3-inch LCD
- form factor... compared to others in its class, i.e. PASs that have great zoom and full creative modes, this was the smallest -- it actually fits in your pocket (bizarrely Ive seen a bunch of reviews that say its too big for your pocket -- not true at all as long as youre not wearing ridiculously tight pants), unlike those PASs (including a lot of Canons) that are, to me, in no-mans-land because theyre too big for a PAS and too small, not enough lens quality and w/o lens interchangeability to be a SLR
- has a jog dial! (like SLRs have)... so great, and not that many PASs have it.  Lets you very quickly review/search through tons of photos, and quickly change shooting parameters like ISO, aperture, shutter speed, instead of pushing pushing pushing buttons to get what you want
- the awesome Canon user interface -- I have tried all different brands and Canon is the best hands down
- image stabilization seemed to work pretty well

Cons:
Big Cons
 - I do not like the AA battery as power source.  This camera chews up AA batteries like no other... on one day when I took about 250+ pictures I went through 8 AA batteries.  Granted:  I probably should have bought a rechargeable AA system before I left, never tried that and also, the batteries for sale in Asia are cheap but they are absolute crap (even Western brands, although they were probably knockoffs).  The high-quality $12 lithium AAs I bought in the US before I left lasted much longer, but still not that long.
- the flash has to sit there and get recharged by the batteries before you can shoot again.  My guess is it takes about 3-5 seconds, which is an eternity when youre asking people to hold a pose or youve got a fleeting chance at a great photo opp... this actually caused me to miss a few good shots
- video -- you cannot zoom in or out once you start filming!  I have no idea why not.  Also, the video quality options are that of cameras from a few years ago.. cant shoot in HD, and cant shoot at a super-high rate of frames per second like some tiny Elphs from years ago can
Small cons
- cant shoot in RAW -- wont bother most people since most people just shoot JPGs but I will be moving to RAW soon
- a bit slow to focus, I have definitely seen better in lots of PAS cameras
- face detection was not as good as some other PASs Ive seen -- slow to recognize faces if it even recognized them at all -- although not a huge deal for me as I never rely on face detection to focus
- in the display review, there are four displays to cycle through -- the 4th is a focus check which zooms on the center of the photo (or face if detected).  Its pointless -- it does nothing more than what you do anyway to check focus when you do a standard review, you zoom in using the zoom buttons and move around the picture to see what you want to check -- except it adds extra cumbersome steps.  Canon should get rid of this -- all I want when I cycle through review display modes is the 3rd display -- to check the histogram and see what the camera chose if Im not in full Manual (i.e. what ISO if Im using auto-ISO, what shutter speed if Im using aperture-priority, etc.)   
- would be nice to have an exposure bracketing feature, but this is something you almost never see on PASs anyway

Anyway, I gave this 5 stars, I couldnt have bought a better camera for my trip, but would have given it a 4.5 if possible due to the above issues... HOWEVER, I see now that Canon has already fixed some of this in a new model called the SX200 IS, which has rechargeable lithium ion battery, more megapixels, HD video and more zoom (although I believe this is deceiving since the 35mm equivalent is actually lower than the SX110, maybe the SX200 has a smaller sensor?  Anyway the upside is you have a wider angle shot when not zoomed).

In summary I highly recommend this camera.</Content>

<Content>Nice image quality outdoors. Zoom is nice. 

But for my purposes, the long waits between when the flash is ready is a showstopper. This makes it almost impossible to capture spontaneous moments. I generally respect Canon quality, but Im afraid Ill be returning the SX110 IS to the store.</Content>

<Content>I recently upgraded to this camera from one with 3-megapixel, 6x zoom limitations.  With no more preparation than reading the manual on the plane on my way to Europe, I feel that I was able to use this camera effectively on my 3-week trip.  The manual is easy to follow, the variety of settings easy to use and my pictures have come out clean and crisp.  I am most happy with this camera and especially like the possibilities afforded by the 10x zoom.</Content>

<Content>I purchased a pair of these cameras on Amazon the end of December, which were shipped from Adorama Camera.  After less than 3 months of light use, both of them exhibited the Lens error, restart camera message.  In my case, one lens is stuck all the way out and the other was partway retracted.  Im probably going to get stiffed on the repair fees for the second, which I pushed in after it got stuck and now semi-operates.

The features are great for the price--especially the 10x zoom.  I initially liked the cameras a lot, and I would have written off one failure as bad luck.  After all Ive had 4 other Canon digicams over the course of the past ~7 years that have been completely trouble-free.  However 2 for 2 seems like a quality control problem--one which I find unacceptable on a high-end (Canons descriptor) consumer camera.</Content>

It takes too long to power-up in between shots. Get some good rechargeable AA batteries, so you dont waste your money on lots of batteries. </Content>

<Content>This camera is great, right out of the box I could figure out how to use most of the features. The zoom is spectacular, as well as the huge LCD screen. I thought that lifting the flash was going to be a problem or would be annoying, but Ive actually found that I like it better than pushing a button to turn the flash on or off. The only negatives are that you really have to use the flash indoors unless you and your subjects are unnaturally still, and that its rather large compared to other cameras Ive had in the past. Overall though I love this camera and would definitely recommend it. </Content>

<Content>This camera is my first venture into the world of digital photography, although I used to be an advanced amateur in the older film photography. I had all kinds of lenses and my own darkroom. Finally I could see the writing on the wall, however, and realized that I had to go digital. I am glad that I selected this camera. It has an amazing variety of settings, most of which I havent learned yet. But that is no drawback at all, since it works so well in the Auto or Easy settings. So it is the best of both worlds: I can use it as a simple point and shoot, or I can gradually work into the complexities and all the capabilities that this little masterpiece boasts. So far, results have been very satisfactory, both for outdoor shooting and for indoor use, both with and without flash. I have experimented with the 10x zoom, which works great, thanks to the image stabilization. I tried a movie clip of my dog, and it is perfect. Currently my wife and I are house hunting, so I take the camera along and capture views of the houses inside and out so that we can remember which house is which. This is a great help in keeping them from all running together. I am definitely enjoying my SX110is very much.   Now I do have one minor quibble: the camera comes with a 32 MB memory card--32 MB! That is hardly enough to even try the camera out. Come on, Canon--you can do better than that!</Content>

<Content>This camera is so good that I also bought one for my wife!  I have never done that before.

Two of my daughters have expensive digital SLR cameras in the $1,500.00 range which are around two years old.  The SX110IS takes better photos!  This shows how fast technology is moving.

My wife is an artist and enters contests via a photo of her paintings.  Taking an excellent photograph of an original oil painting is almost impossible.  My wife has even hired professional photographers.  The SX110IS absolutely takes the best photos of oil paintings that I have ever seen.  The photos arent just a little bit better, but a whole lot better!

I have taken many photos since I received this camera, including many zoomed-in photos.  I couldnt believe how clear they turned out!

The only thing I dont like about this camera is that I find it difficult to open the batter/memory card compartment.  On my last Canon, the compartment slid open easily.  This one opens the same way, however I have to pry and pry to get it to pop fully open.

<Content>I got this camera as a replacement to the Sony W150. I was not impressed with the blurry pics I was getting with the Sony. So i returned that item and got the Canon SX 110 IS. I did a lot of reading before getting this. I must say I got really good pictures with this camera. I took almost 600-700 pictures with this camera in different conditions. I took pictures on 2 completely different occasions, one was on a day on which we had a snow storm. So there was no sun and only snow, the other day being beautifully sunny. I got exceptional quality pics on both these occasions. I am still trying to explore the various options this camera provides especially the manual mode etc. 

My list of good and bad is as follows: 

G00D 
====== 
1. Great Picture quality in most conditions. 
2. Very good in handling difficult light conditions. 
3. Exceptional 10X Optical zoom. I could get really close to distant objects. 
4. Beautiful black body. Very comfortable in your hand. 
5. Terrific maintenance of colors. Got exceptional color quality in bright sunlight. 
6. Great manual features. Helps photography enthusiasts like me to learn new ways of photography and techniques. Also has the auto modes for people who like to keep it simple. 
7. I like the SD card format for its simplicity. I ordered an additional 4GB transcend class 6 card which is amazingly fast. 
8. It runs on 2 NIMH rechargeable batteries. I got the Sony cycle energy 2000Mah to go with these and they also provide me exceptional long lasting power. 
9. The SD card also performs very good. very fast to copy and delete, reformat etc. 

NOT SO GOOD 
=========== 
1. The Flash recharge time is very slow. This is one thing which I am not liking in this camera. It takes atleast 5-6 seconds to recharge the flash and during this time, you cannot take another shot. So you might miss out in catching a good shot on time. 
2. The AA cells this cam uses makes a bit heavy to hold. I am ok with it but others might want a lighter camera. 
3. Sometimes it looks like the camera takes some time and is a second late to take the picture after pressing the shutter button. So instead of capturing the intended action of the subject, it captures the next action which defeats the purpose of the shot. 
4. In low light conditions and photos taken inside the house, it shows some kind of white patches in the picture. I took a picture of my wall and it is showing some kind of white patches on the wall which is not seen normally. I dont know what extra the camera is able to see or should I be changing the settings. Yet to explore on that. 
5. It doesnt come with a neck strap. I would have liked if it came with a neck strap. 
6. The supplied image gateway software has been useless to me. It is of huge size and is a drap on my laptop. I didnt find any real useful or addtional features in this than what is there on other image editing software. 

All in all , I think this is a great camera for the $200 you spend. You will get beautiful snaps with this camera. At the same time, I think you should take this camera if you have real interst in learning photography and do a lot of reading becos thats how you can appreciate the lot of manual features this camera offers. I would definitely recommend this. </Content>

<Content>When we purchased this canon power shot we had done so after shopping it and checking out reviews on line. We found that the 9 mp and 10 x zoom was more powerful than the camera we had and were replacing. well we have used it now and it is wonderful. the pictures are crisp, clear, vibrant colors. the zoom is more powerful than we thought it would be. the only thing that is an issue is when using the flash to take pictures of our bird, the flashing that happens before the picture is taken hurts their eyes and they run to fly back to their cages.

<Content>When used outside in good light (or extremely bright indoor light, such as next to a window) it is an outstanding camera.  It can take high-quality shots of stills, portraits, and action shots.  The zoom is very effective at distance, and the settings can go from fully automatic to completely manual.  In the right light this camera can get professional-quality shots.

However, indoors this camera is no better than a typical point and shoot camera that would fit in your pocket.  The flash is weak (even at the highest setting), and pictures without flash are almost impossible.  ISO greater than 200 is pointless as photos will be overcome by noise.  If all you plan to do is have people hold still while you take a picture from less than seven feet, then youll be fine.  If you are trying to get action shots indoors, forget about it.  

This camera will gobble batteries faster than a pig runs to slops.  Youll be lucky to get fifty pictures out of a new set of alkaline batteries.  However, if you get a good set of rechargable batteries, youll be overwhelmingly and pleasantly surprised by how many pictures you can get:  hundreds.  Go figure.  I have four rechargable batteries.  I use two at a time, and can easily take 500 pictures before having to recharge.

The flash is very slow to recycle, so again, indoor shots with this camera are slow and annoying.

The camera is very reasonably priced.  I paid two Benjamins for it new and have taken a couple thousand photos already.  The colors are brilliant and popping, but realistic.  Like I said, with good light, you cant go wrong with this camera.  I mostly use the TV setting.  I set my shutter speed at about 250-360 and then I dont miss a single action shot.  Its fast, reliable, and fun.  This camera can get you results that look professional.

The camera is bulky.  If you carry a large purse, youll be fine with it, or if you use a backpack/briefcase.  But if youre expecting to slip this into your shirt pocket or jeans pocket, forgetabboutit.  It wont fit.  It will only fit in a very loose pants pocket, and even then its annoying.  You could put it in a case and attach it to your belt, which works great, but ruins the style factor.  This camera looks like an old 1980s film camera (although it performs like a dynamite digital).  You wont win any style points with this camera.  

If you are going to have to lug something around and want the best quality you can afford, look at the Rebel XS, the best priced digital DSLR on the market.  But if you only have two hundred bucks, and cant go another three hundred, then get this SX110is.  Its a great camera and I dont regret the purchase for a minute.</Content>

<Content>Canon has always come through for me with cameras. The pictures are always vivid and clear and easy to shoot. I have not had a chance to play extensively with the more advanced features yet, but with what I have seen, I cannot expect for $200. I only wish.. Canon would put the swivelling lcd screen on all their models. I nearly paid anothe $150 for the SX10 simply because of it.

Pros:
-Clear pictures
-Reasonable video
-Easy to operate in simple or advanced modes
-Decent price
Cons:
-Sometimes a little hard to get the camera to focus on what you want it to.
-some features feel a little less sturdy that some of the previous A series cameras.

<Content>The Canon Powershot SX110IS is a fantastic camera.  Before you buy a camera, make sure that you do your research and know what you are buying.  I Purchased this camera for 2 main reasons, the 10X Optical Zoom and the 3 inch viewer window. The 10X Optical Zoom is amzing.  I take mostly outdoor pictures, so the fact that I need to flip my the flash is not a factor for me.  I do not take many indoor action pictures so that 10 second recharge of the flash is not an issue for me.  This camera does not have a view finder and again, my former camera did, but I never used it, I always used the view finder so not having a view finder was not an issue for me.  

The quality of pictures are 100% what I was looking for. The Camera is easy to hold, the controls are located in perfect spots for me to use.  I looked at the A2000IS in addition to the SX110IS and found that the A2000IS was not easy to hold and that the controls were not in easy to operate locations for me.  

When I puchased this camera from Amazon.com, I selected the free shipping, the 6-10 day delivery..  I ordered the camera on a Tuesday and it was delivered to my house the very next day, Wednesday.  I was expecting the 6-10 day wait and was totally surprised when it was delivered the very next day.  

I find the SX110IS is a perfect camera for my needs.. I encourage everyone to do your research before you purchase a camera so that when you purchase a camera, you know what you are buying and you know the pros and cons of every camera. </Content>

However the video quality is not so good. In photo mode, I can zoom in very well and the pictures come out very nicely. For the video, if I donot zoom, the quality is ok, but if I zoom, it is bad.

Also this camera drains the batteries quickly. I am using a pair of rechargeable batteries to feed this. Overall, I like this camera. </Content>

<Content>The latest offering from canon- Canon Powershot SX110IS 9MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) is great for the money you spent on it. I have been using this camera for the past 2 months and its just marvelous! It has an easy mode which makes it seem like childs play (useful for oldies, my gf loves it). The Program, Manual, Tv etc modes are great for photography enthusiasts like me. The telephoto lens accounts for great pictures. The SX110IS has modes for almost every kind of picture, be it a sunset or foliage, snow or fireworks. Whatever your need, its got it. The interface is pretty simple to use and follows previous canon models which is good since i owned an A560 before. It is lightweight, sleek enough to slip in your jacket pocket. For a camera with 10X zoom that is a big thing. The zoom works great and accounts for amazing closeups. 

I would recommend this camera to everyone I know. Id suggest you get a PSC-100 case for it along with a tripod. The case doesnt have any pockets but that keeps the sleek advantage of the camera alive. 

The only con I can think of is the medium-low battery life due to the really large LCD screen, which is awesome btw. Just buy a couple of pairs of extra rechargeable batteries and youre good to go!</Content>

-Powerful flash.

CONS:
-Little bulky for a PS.
-No viewfinder.
-Terrible noise after ISO 200.
-Short battery life (with NiMH rechargable batteries)

<Content>Im basically a point and shoot guy, but I have enjoyed changing camera settings and dabbling a little bit in taking pictures of individual tropical fish in my aquarium, which is somewhat of a chore.  Last year I bought a Sony H7 to replace my Canon A85.  Though I could get good fish pictures after much reading and fiddling around, I was terribly disappointed and frustrated by the Sonys inability to take good indoor pictures using the automatic settings.  I always had to go through the long process of editing the brightness and color of my pictures and even then was not always happy.  I now have the Canon SX110 and am very happy with it.  Heres my take on a comparison of it to my old camera.

Things I really like about my Canon SX110 compared to my Sony H7 and others . . . 

1. Blur check feature on playback setting
2. The mode dial doesnt get accidentally turned as easy and mess up my pictures!!!!
3. The auto setting puts out better picture color in florescent light than the Sony did!!!
4. The auto setting chooses a lower ISO (200 vs 400) in low light giving less grainy pictures than the Sony!!
5. The view screen is bigger and has more pixels making it easier to tell if my printed results will be satisfactory!!
6. Image stabilization seems to work better than with the Sony
7. This camera is small enough to carry on my belt, in my coat pocket, or in my wifes purse
8. The cheaper price (counting a case, batteries, and cards, I spent $220 versus around $300
9. The lense cover is automatic instead of having to remember to take it off and put it on.
10. The manual settings are more easily navigated- e.g.the 2 click process to change ISO or face detection
11. Ability to erase a picture with two button pushes rather than three
12. The Program mode will hold its settings even if you have changed the ISO, aperature, or shutter speed while in Manual mode (I missed good pictures because the Sony changed settings across the board)


The few things I dont like about my Canon SX110 compared to my Sony H7 and others . . .

1. The flash does not pop up automatically
2. The flash does not recharge as quickly
3. The zoom is shorter 
4. There is no neck strap, but instead just a wrist strap
5. The memory card is inside the battery compartment so batteries can easily fall out while removing the card.

Concerning the flash, I just have to get in the habit of putting it up like I had to get in the habit of taking off the lens cap with the Sony.  If I forget, the camera does tell me.  Concerning the recharge time, I have to live with that, but you can take a non flash picture while waiting and there is some benefit to being able to use AA Alkalines in a pinch and cheap rechargeables the rest of the time.  Concerning the zoom, I have yet to miss it and can always cut and crop.  When I did zoom the full 15x on my Sony it seemed I always had color output and exposure problems anyway.  Concerning the lack of a neck strap, a good camera bag will have one and you can add one to your camera too if you can find one like I had from a Sandisk flash drive.  Concerning the battery compartment, Ive found it easiest to hook the camera to the computer using the USB cord that I just leave attached to the computer, and thats a small price to pay for the ease of getting good picture output.  On the same note, it would have been nice if the cord attached to the camera on the side opposite the grip of the camera.


A few other features some may dislike or miss with the Canon vs the Sony

1. The battery life is shorter
2. There is no viewfinder to use in bright light or to help conserve battery power
3. The flash is not as powerful

But none of the above bother me in the least.  Its easy to carry extra Nimh AA batteries and I never used the viewfinder with my Sony to begin with nor on the other digital camera I had before it.  As for the flash, even though I envision that I would use the extra power occasionally and did try it a few times with the Sony, that occasion is too rare to worry about.  I was never happy with Sonys green and grainy output in such circumstances, so that makes it easier not to miss.  Besides, Canon does sell an add on flash that one can use with this camera if he sees a need for it.

A few other features some may like about the Canon versus the Sony

1. On the fly red eye removal
2. The well chosen scene setting selections available with the twist of the dial and others easily accessible
3. The more popular and universal SD memory card versus Sonys propriety MS Pro Duo card
4. The easy setting that requires no camera know how except to pop up the flash, point, and shoot

That does it for a review from the perspective of a simple point and shoot guy.  I hope it can help someone make the choice that will best meet their needs on the first try, instead of having to buy two cameras like I did.  Happy shooting!</Content>

<Content>OK, I admit it.  I am just a regular person who has a dream of being a great photographer some day.  Well, I think this is the camera that will help me do just that.  Right now, I can use easy mode to take totally awesome pictures.  I took a zoom picture at the airport to see how it worked, and you can almost read the names on the luggage tags!  My pictures out of the airplane window looked professional.  And as I figure stuff out, this camera grows with you.  It does all kinds of amazing things, so I will never outgrow it.  I was afraid I would miss the viewfinder.  Not at all.  I even forgot it doesnt have one.  The screen is better anyway.  I have glasses, and no more bumping the viewfinder into my glasses!

Like I said, Im no expert.  I cant go into detail about pixels and all the settings, and camera noise.  But I WILL learn!  In the meantime, I can still take great pictures.  I am soooooo happy.

<Content>This is the first digital camera that Ive purchased.The transition from film to digital turned out to be a wonderful experience.I picked one with the largest display ( 3 ).which is perfect for reviewing what you have just done and for  showing to others.The zoom is another great feature for getting in close to my cat without being close and for bringing outside stuff closer.The settings are pretty easy to set and for the most part Ive left most the decision making to the camera in its auto mode.Its easy to take dozens of pictures and then delete all the bad ones and then take another bunch.I use rechargeable batteries and one of those sdhc cards that can let me store about 1000 pictures on it-which is far more than Ive taken in my life.I have made beautiful prints on my canon mp960 printer which again makes most the adjustments for me.
I know Ive babbled on but the point is I feel this is one great camera and it made the transition easy and enjoyable without a whole bunch of stress.I would strongly recommend this great camera to anyone.Gete a little camera bag and take it everywhere you go.It is fun and so easy to review ,delete ,keep your shots and then take more.</Content>

<Content>I really love this camera, ive had it for awhile now, 8 months. First my negatives are that the Flash is super slow, and trying to take sport shots is horrible. That might be user error though. I was scared to get a camera that uses double AA, but I got energizer batteries and i take millions of pictures and my camera never dies. On a recent week long trip to cali i took atleast 200 pics and never had to charge my batteries. The pictures are crisp, and look good blown up. The camera is a little bulky, compared to the point and shoot cameras they are making now, but all in all i love it and would buy it again. I also like the option that it is only 200. (best buy will price match from amazon) and it has the option of being advanced if i decide i want to get creative. I would recommend this for somone else. </Content>

<Content>I love this camera.  I was able to take pictures in very dark settings without flash by programming the ISO up to 1600.  The 10x zoom works very well.  The digital zoom gives a somewhat grainy picture, but also works well when its necessary to use it.  The only down side is that it eats batteries at a very fast clip.  I purchased Eneloop batteries, which are supposed to last longer, but even they were only good for about 300 pics, where AAs were good for between 150 and 200 pics.  The solution, of course, is to carry multiple batteries of any type and recharge often.</Content>

I agree with all the great stuff said about this camera. I got it for the zoom, even though the whole camera is a tad bigger than most. 

I noticed after having it a few days though, it has developed a CLUNK as I tip it forward and back. I can almost feel it behind the scroll wheel. Its not the batteries or card, so Im wondering if it was there the whole time? or if something came loose on the insides.

Does anyone else have this issue? By the way, its about 3 times louder than the side to side click you get from the mechanism that knows which way to turn the photo on the screen while reviewing.

<Content>Ive had it about a month, and I couldnt be more thrilled.  I coach basketball, and overhead fluorescent lights are a nightmare for photos; I needed some more advanced settings, but Im basically just above point-and-shoot as a photographer.  Canons have always treated me right, and this is my best yet.  The settings are easy; the adjustable ISO is a treat for sports photography; the 10X zoom has given me incredible results.  Yes, there are a LOT of settings, and curling up with the manual will pay serious dividends, so you might want to do that -- you have a lot of resources with this camera if you take the time to learn how to use it properly.  Im getting the best gym photos EVER with this camera, and I recommend it completely.  Just make sure you have plenty of batteries available!</Content>

<Content>I will start with the bottom-line.... This is one excellent camera! With that said, there are a couple of things you should know when un-boxing the system. First of all, the measly 32mb memory card you receive is just about worthless. Plan on purchasing a 8gb card. They can be had for about $15 and if you take many photos or any videos you will be glad you did. 

Also, my cameras video setting came out of the box in the compact mode, which in my option produces unusable video. Change it to the standard video/640 30fps (page 89 in the User Guide). While this still will not provide you with HD video, it is acceptable for causal shooting. However, the included 32mb memory card will only hold about 15 seconds of video at this setting.

Now for the important part. For the price point, this camera would be extremely hard to beat! The features are numerous and quite amazing. I took a picture of an object so far away I could hardly make it out, at full optical and digital zoom and the results were unbelievable. However, I must say I did enhance the photo a bit in Photoshop. You could probably do the same in just about any photo software program, even the one that comes with the camera. 

I cant say I found any cons with this camera. Since I take causal and semi-professional photographs in my web designing business, I wanted a camera that was compact yet provided excellent results. If I wasnt concern with the size, I would have likely purchased a SX10 IS or XS1 IS, but for what I need the SX110 IS is more than adequate.

However, as others have mentioned the camera does eat a steady supply of batteries. Either buy your AAs in bulk or goes the rechargeable route. I didnt call the cameras energy requirement a con, because I like the big, bright and beautiful LCD and other power hungry features. For me, it is a reasonable tradeoff. 

I would highly recommend this camera and I wish you happy shooting!

<Content>The camera meets a specific need in our family, and that is as a simple and rapidly deployable grab and go camera for recording cute stuff the kids do at school and on field trips.  

I already owned a Canon S3/IS camera (currently the S10/IS) which is well over $300 and vastly superior in several ways, but it has one major flaw and that is its thick profile.  Its a bulky camera.  You cant just stuff it into any pocket or purse or in a jacket. 

I figured that I was missing a good amount of recordable cuteness because my wife wouldnt grab the big fat S3/IS and take it with her, so I bought her this slim and not quite so capable camera with essentially the same menus and controls as its bigger brother.

Now my wife grabs it and takes it places and I get more pictures and movies of the kids for our archives.   What a great age to be a parent.

Heres what I particularly like.

1.  The big screen on the back.

2.  Face detection.

3.  30 fps DVD resolution movie capability.

4.  Just plain takes good pictures.

5.  High Capacity SD chip compatibility.

6.  Skinny even with the AA batteries.

7.  AA batteries!  I really hate having to remember to charge proprietary little batteries. You have to have at least two so you can use one while the other is charging, and they eventually become useless and you have to replace them.   I love buying AA batteries in bulk, using them, and throwing them away.  Bwa ha ha ha ha!

Now the stuff I dont like

1.  It cant auto focus while zooming and shooting a movie.  I dont know that any camera at this price point does.  The big brother S10/IS probably excels at this because my S3/IS sure does.  I miss that capability in this camera.

2.  Cant shoot around corners or hold the camera at weird angles because the LCD is in the back of the camera and does not flip out and swivel.  I cant hold this thing over my head and shoot down.

3.  Chews up the batteries faster than the larger Canon, understandably, and takes longer to ready the flash than the larger Canon does. 

4.  And, a nitpick that really bugs me.  The SD card and the battery compartment are behind the same little door, which is on there really tight and its a pain to have to open the battery compartment just to pop out the SD card, which I do way more often than swapping batteries because my PC has a card drive built in and transfers several GIG in a few seconds when I plug a card into it. 

So, if you want a LCD on a pivot, or you really want your digital camera to double as a camcorder, by all means spend the extra money to get the higher end camera.  If you want a grab and go camera thats a cut above many of the little tiny silver things that so many people seem to be in love with, try this one. </Content>

<Content>We are very pleased with the function of this Canon Powershot SX110IS 9mp digital camera which we bought several weeks ago.  My son has learned how to use more of the cameras functions better than I have since I am still an amateur with digital cameras.  The 3 in. LCD screen is great!  Videos are of excellent quality.  Both inside  outside pictures are also of great quality.  The zoom as been fun to play around with and yields detailed results.  Review of shot pictures is easy.  I am concerned about scratching the LCD screen  know that it could be covered with a pop up shade or plastic screen which we do not have at this point.  It takes 2 AA batteries which drain very quickly.  After research on the use of this camera and reading reviews, etc., we bought Sanyo Eneloop NiMH rechargeable batteries which are long lasting.  We did not buy a fast charger because that is hard on the batteries per reviews.  I recommend this camera!  </Content>

<Content>I researched for a long time on the different brands out there. I have had Canon products for many years (was a professional) and decided to stick with them.
This camera is absolutley amazing. The PQ is outstanding as is the video quality. I was blown away by that.
We recently had a snow storm and I took night photos (tripod) and the photos were excellent. I then took more photos the next morning and they were outstanding. The photos were of trees with heavy snow on one side. Great contrast between the snow and the bark. The trees were about 30 - 200 feet away. And all photos were taken through a window! They almost appeared to be HD quality. If anyone doubts this, I will gladly email you some samples.
The camera is feature packed and some have complained about this (too many settings). My advice would be to get a cheaper digital that you may feel is easier. But for a novice it is still a great camera since you can put it on full auto and get exceptional photos. Then you can learn at your pace. But I would recommend this camera just for the PQ alone.
A friend of mine had a new Olympus and after seeing this camera and its PQ, they returned the Olympus and bought this one.

Pros: - Everything
Cons: - None

Let me address some other users cons.
* Poor battery life - This camera has excellent battery life. I had an older HP digital and the batteries kept dying after about 30 shots, then 20, then 10 then nothing. I thought it was the camera. Turns out it was the batteries. I was using a fast charger (30) and that killed them. I educated myself about batteries and found that you need a good charger that is capable of charging at different rates. The fast chargers are harmful and will prematurely end the batteries life. 

My friend who had the Olympus had the same problem. New batteries and was only getting about 30 photos. She thought it was the camera. I took her batteries and charged them in the Maha C9000 charger and after the first charge, she got over 180 photos (test) with the same batteries.
GET A GOOD BATTERY CHARGER AND YOU WILL SEE A MAJOR DIFFERANCE WITH ANY DEVICE.
Another con mentioned was about poor indoor shooting quality. The camera has an indoor mode that takes away the tungsten lighting effect and gives great PQ. Of course you still need the flash. I took photos of Grandchildren moving indoors and the PQ was great again. Even without the indoor setting the PQ was great.

As mentioned, I was blown away about the PQ of video. It was THAT good. Granted, if you put the setting on 320 which is the setting for emailing, then you will see some PQ degradation. But on the upper quality settings it is outstanding. With a 2GB memory card, you can get about 18 of video on the highest quality setting. About 45 on the lowest setting.

Of course, the camera, will have features you will never use, but its merits are the PQ and overall features. The macro setting is excellent also. You can get within a 1/2 of the object. The detail it shows is terrific also.

As you can see, I cant rave enough about this camera. I do NOT work for Canon or have any affiliation with them. Its just that I am that pleased with this camera.

A word on their customer support. Great!
I emailed them with a question AFTER I bought the camera (locally). Their Web site says they will get back to you within 24 hours. I was skeptical. Were talking CANON, not Mom  Pop.
They answered me in 12 hours!

Great camera... just remember to educate yourself on batteries. This is important. Its the batteries that are failing BUT its the CHARGER thats making them fail, prematurely.
Go to a site like Thomas Distributing and you can get a lot of information there. STAY AWAY FROM THE CHEAP FAST CHARGERS.</Content>

<Content>Ive owned three point and shoot digital cameras in my life, each one a different brand. In addition I do a lot of SLR digital photography and find myself in the middle of discussions about cameras a great deal. When people ask me about this little Canon I will definitely give it a thumbs up, albeit with one or two caveats.

First of all, let me say that I am an insanely impatient person. When I get a brand new camera I want to use it RIGHT AWAY!  I dont want to have to spend any time mucking around with a manual.  I want a camera that is going to be user friendly enough for me to navigate within the first 5 minuets of owning it.  So on the scale for impatient people like me, this camera rates about a seven.  I could find my way around most of it but have had to pull out the dreaded manual once or twice to get to a menu that was well hidden, or to interpret a symbol that was unfamiliar.

I like flexibility in a camera.  I want to have plenty of quick-to-get-at user settings, but  also want the freedom to adjust my settings as needed.  The camera gets a TEN on the flexibility scale.  It also gets big points for the 10x lens, and the way the flash works. I hate flashes that pop up automatically when you have all your settings on automatic.  There are plenty of times when you dont want a flash even though your subject is technically too dark.  This camera suggests (in big letters so you wont miss it) that you raise the flash, but doesnt insist.  If you do choose to use the flash its as simple as manually flipping it up.  There are some other great features about this PowerShot as well.  The zoom is fast, the lag time is short, and the camera just plain feels good to hang on to. 

My only complaints so far are the batteries.  I prefer to have rechargeable, camera specific, batteries from the manufacturer.  I keep an extra set and have one charging while one is in use.  This PowerShot takes regular AA batteries.  In addition to being wasteful (the camera pulls a lot of power and sucks down batteries pretty quickly) this is no good for cold weather conditions.  Ive gone and gotten some rechargeable AAs, but those seem to wear out even faster than the regular ones.

For the price though, I think this camera is one of the best youll ever own and I have no problem highly recommending it.

<Content>First, the battery life is horrible!  I have yet to go one hour with new batteries or rechargable ones - having to replace batteries throughout a daytrip will be inconvience.  The door to open for the batteries is very difficult.  

The camera is just too heavy.
Too many options - will take a long time to learn the manual.
Recharge time with flash is way too long.
Recharge time without using flash is too long as well.

Hate to say it, the camera is getting returned.

<Content>Right out of the box this camera was ready to go. It was easy to change settings and the pictures are very good.

My wife isnt in to complicated devices so just putting it on auto is perfect for her and I have options to use that she would never try.

The price I paid saved me over 20% of what I would have paid at a walk in store.

Thanks Amazon,

<Content>I put a lot of work into picking out this camera. I wanted a better quality camera for a great price. The more professional cameras started at $400 it seemed, so I stuck with the bargains. I had the Powershot A630 with a flip out screen previously. My daughter found it on my desk and started to play with it, dropped it and the shutter broke and the auto focus seems to be off too. (For Christmas she got her own durable kids camera, lesson learned!) So the first brand I started reading about was Canon Powershot. I saw an ad for this camera by chance while browsing another Powershot and immediately I loved it. It looked like a great balance between the SLRs and the pocket cameras. Its exactly what I wanted.

Pros: Very large LCD screen, large viewing range, 9MP, Great auto focus and a great pop up flash. Its a meaty camera. It makes me feel like its durable-although Im not going to let my 3 year old test that theory.

It takes AA batteries. I guess that could be a pro or a con, depending on your preference. I prefer AAs because if I get in a bind I can just run into any store and pick up some cheap batteries to last a few hours.

Cons: No eye hole (sorry, dont know the correct term for that thing!). Its a little slow recovering from a busy picture. If there is a lot going on in the background it takes a few seconds to write the picture and be ready for another one. Its also large for a pocket camera. That doesnt bother me, but if youre looking for an Elph size, this isnt for you. </Content>

<Content>Bought this for myself for Christmas this year- got it at a great price and got a 25$ gift certificate with it too-  takes amazing pictures and rocks at videos- just needed something so that I could send pictures of my kids to my parents and was shocked to get such an awesome camera out of it.  One of my favorite things is that the video function isnt on a timer like my old camera, so as long as I have memory space open I can keep recording- put a 8 gig mem card in there and I can record for quite a while, in fact my batteries gave out first lol. The quality is great, its sturdy, and is an all around great camera.</Content>

<Content>Camera works as advertised. The pictures are great and true to color.The 10x optical lens is fantastic for close up shots or just to zoom in on facial expressions of kids. Hands down the best camera Ive ever owned, including Olympus, Nikon  Fugi units.
Only complaint is the power adapter is not adaptable to other Canon models. Why they cant make 1 fits all is beyond me. This trait is not only Cannon cameras but Nikon  Olympus. Its like they want to keep you buying more equipment!!</Content>

<Content>I really like this camera even though it does not have a conventional viewfider.  The 10x zoom lens is great.  The large display is fine and usable in full sun.  Battery life is good and it accepts AA rechargables that I like better than the flat batteries.  While these batteries make the camera larger than pocket size, my I usually do not put my camera away when I hike, unless it goes into my backpack.

The camera has a great feel and look, but more importantly it takes great images that are sharp from corner to corner.  It comes up quickly and is ready for the second shot in less than three seconds even at full resolution and lowest compression. The image stabilization is very useful and effective in low light or when seriously zoomed.

I use this camera to take very large panoramas of 200 megapixels and larger by shooting a hundred photos in rapid sequence by using a robotic system (GigaPan).  This is a dependable workhorse camera that is easy to use but also allows quick access to important features for the knowledgable user.</Content>

I want to be able to swap out dead batteries instead of looking for someplace to charge them when I am in the woods.  I am very happy with this camera.  It is larger than most compacts and smaller than a SLR type camera.  Happy medium.

<Content>Im a diligent shopper when it comes to some purchases.   Ive been researching buying a new digital camera off and on for about 6 months and I can say my patience has been rewarded.  My two previous digital cameras were Sonys.  The main reason for a new digicam was image stabilization.  Ive taken up kayaking and found many of my on water photos were coming out blurry, even in bright daylight.

Likes:
Macro is amazing with the SX110is.  You can rest the cameras lens on a page and it will autofocus on the lettering.  You can also manual focus in most modes.  Great for catching minute details.

10x optical zoom!  40x digital zoom!  It gets you up close when distance between you and your subject is required.  Zoom up to 4x digitally while recording movie, although it does get grainy and you can hear the lever click on the recording.

This flash is so much better than either of my Sonys.  The range is so much farther, and thats without any flash level adjustments.

The cost!  A camera of this quality, with so many options at the $200 mark!  Outstanding!

Dislikes:
It would be nice if the flash would automatically pop up when needed like the Sony does.  Although Ill admit it made me jump while playing with one at Best Buy.

Too many options (13!) on the Mode Dial .  My last Sony had 6 and the other options were software accessible.  Im just afraid all that turning is going to wear out the dial faster.  

Also the control dial can be skittish while reviewing photos.  Its too easy to press (select) while spinning (scrolling). 



This is the second SX110is I purchased from Amazon.  I think the first one was a return because it was missing the documentation tray and the little tag that was hanging of my new one.  I returned it because the usb/av cover wouldnt stay closed.  No problem with the new one Im happy to say.

Overall its a great camera.  My first Canon.  I cant wait to get back on the water with it.  I keep it in a dry bag until I use if you are wondering.

<Content>Got the camera as a Christmas gift for the wife, who wasnt happy with our other point  shoot cameras because of the lack of focal length for taking pics of the daughter at her VBall games. Didnt want the hassle/size of my digital SLR.  The camera is impressive!  Easy to use, amazing telephoto capabilities and pictures that easily surpass the Canon, Sony and Olympus point  shoots that other family members have, which are 1, 2 and 3 years old.  Could not be happier with it.  It has been borrowed mulitple times already by kids who would rather use it because of that 10X optical zoom.  With the digital zoom, its got greater magnification than my SLR with a 300mm lense.  The only negative is that with such a small and light camera, it is hard to hold steady at high magnification; you need a stabilizing point or monopod.</Content>

<Content>I usually do not write reviews but thought Id throw in my 2 cents about this camera. I purchased it because it had the best reviews of the point  shoot variety cameras and the digital camera I have is only a 4 megapixel  it was time to upgrade....or so I thought. I used it for a week and returned it for the following problems:
1. It had an excruciatingly long shutter lag compared to my old kodak easy share. I couldnt ever get off shots in time to catch my 1 year old doing something cute. And, if she moved...like all kids do...the shots came out blurry. I even had it on the setting for kids and pets. Also I had the SDHC card in it.
2. No matter what I did (yes, I read the manual) I kept getting photos that looked very poorly focused. Not even as crisp as my 4 megapixel. 
3. With the flash on, people were washed out, with it off, they were in dark shadows. There seemed no happy medium.
4. The face finder feature made getting a shot off take too long.
5. The color in photos seemed off...not natural. 
6. The menus just were not all that easy to follow or intuitive, at least to me, from other cameras I have used in the past. 
I have been taking photos for 25 years and am used to getting really great shots. That just didnt happen with this camera. It was pretty frustrating. Maybe it is great for things that dont move, like flowers, but for anyone wanting to catch their kids before the moment is gone, maybe this camera is not for you. </Content>

<Content>This Canon has many good qualities. It is comfortable to hold and shoot with, its zoom is very good, and it takes pretty good pictures. But Im quite disappointed with the flip flash. I much prefer automatic flash. I dont like having to remember to flip up the flash every time I need it. Since I use flash fill a lot, I miss my old camera that has flash on demand. I also find the zoom controls in an inconvenient location. I prefer them to be in a place where I can easily toggle them with my thumb.</Content>

So, Canon Powershot SX110IS 9MP Digital Camera is in that sense much better then the cameras in that range. 

Nice looking, good quality point-and-shoot type camera which is good/fast/easy  for family use. 
 I recommend this for the people who are not professional photography  and would not want this miss the beauty of life.

Two weeks after I bought the camera I drop it, when I asked how much it will cost me to fix it they said it was more expencive than buying a new one, so I had to buy a new one. Few weekss later, I asked a friend if he could try to fix it. In twenty minutes it was working again... Now my husband and I have the same camera.</Content>

<Content>Records video and takes nice pictures for a point an shoot.  As a professional photographer carrying a large camera isnt always an option for gatherings of friends and family.  The menus are well laid out and simple enough so anyone can pick the camera up and play.  You can view the photos on the screen without having to turn the actual camera on which is nice.  The zoom is perfect for most indoor use as well as long enough for taking outdoor pictures.  The flash doesnt pop up on its own which i personally like as it gives me the choice of using it or not.  Runs for about 2 weeks (used almost every day) on 2 AA rechargeable NiMH batteries from Energizer.  I use an 8gb SDHC card from SanDisk and love it.  My only gripe is that when it came new in box there was a screw missing from the back of the camera.  Nothing that would be a show stopper, I just cant believe Canon would miss something like that. (Which is why I use Nikon DSLRs. :)  That was in jest for those of you Nikon haters.)</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera late-December, after experimenting with it for a few weeks here is my take:

The pros:

- Interface is well done, very easy to understand, learn, and use.
- The 10x optical zoom works great, very nice feature for a camera of this size.
- Has a decent start-up time, from off to ready to shot is roughly 1.5 to 2 seconds.

The cons:

- Very slow when taking pictures. 

In auto-mode with-out flash it took three seconds to go from button push (take a picture) to being ready to take the next picture. The same shot took seven seconds using the flash. In general the actual image capture process is slow on this camera.

- Picture quality issues. 

You can take a decent picture with this camera but odds are you will not be doing it in auto-mode. In particular I find ISO settings above 100 produce very grainy, noisy pictures. I tend to use this camera in either P-mode or M-mode 99% of the time so I can manually set the ISO value to 80. If you always shoot in perfect lighting, or can use a flash maybe this may not be an issue but really you should be able to use higher ISO values without noise totally dominating the picture.

- Construction quality.

The construction of this camera makes it feel somewhat fragile, like I was cradling an egg needing to be super cautious. I kind of wonder at the durability of this unit. Maybe others who have had one longer can comment.

Overall I think this camera had some pluses, and some definite minuses. Its likely I will return this unit but the experience piqued my interest enough that I would like to try other Canon models. </Content>

<Content>This is exactly the camera I wanted.  Easy to use and it takes high quality pictures indoors and out.  I recently went to Monster Jam and was able to take close up pictures of the trucks in action from the upper deck of the Metrodome.  This camera will be an excellent tool for taking shots at my sons sporting events.  This is a significant upgrade over my old Canon Powershot A70.  Autofocus is faster, shutter speed is faster, the zoom rocks, and the large LCD screen is handy for scrutinizing your shots.  My only negative would be the requirement to manually flip up the flash when needed.  The camera does let you know when the flash is needed, but Im used to having a total autoflash.  Just something I have to get used to.</Content>

<Content>Ive always struggled with getting good pictures in a variety of challenging lighting requirements. The Canon Powershot SX110IS 9MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) provides a great balance between total control and total automation. Whether in dark environments or overly brilliant (great shots of snow), a clear picture has been easy to obtain.

Ive used the camera a bit for video. Unfortunately the microphone does not have the greatest quality. It would be nice to zoom during the video but I understand the noise concerns. So it is just as well that it doesnt zoom during video shoots.

This camera provides the features of an SLR in a very compact camera which is critical in my application. I will be interested to see how it holds up in my sometimes rugged travel environments.</Content>

<Content>Ive been using a PowerShot A520 for several years and have been very happy with its simplity, size, and adaptability, but I needed a higher megapixel count than its mere 4 (though that was comparatively high for the pss when I bought it).  And I wanted a stronger zoom for wildlife shots.  I wanted something pocket/purse size to keep with me, which ruled out the SLRs, and this seemed to have both the size and the zoom capability I wanted.  It does.  And its so slightly larger than the older camera that I can still use the same protective case (by Pentax, not Canon).  

However...It has taken some time to get used to its differences from the A520 (some more, some less convenient).  

One of the elements that I dont like is that the SD card slot is in the same compartment as the batteries, so I have to be very careful not to dump the batteries out when Im removing or changing the card.  I need either an extra finger or two, or a lap, available to hold them while Im manipulating everything else.  

Also, I often find the DC-in/AV-out compartment cover ajar.  Whether it opens upon being brushed or bumped or whether it simply doesnt latch firmly, I havent yet determined.  Im concerned because it appears flimsy enough to break off without much effort.

As others have mentioned, there is no viewfinder on this camera.  I was used to using a viewfinder but have had no difficulty adapting to using the screen.  I must admit, however, that I havent tried to use it on days bright enough to potentially make viewing the screen difficult.  I tend to shoot during the golden hours or with angled lighting rather than in strong sunlight so havent given that an adequate test.

I expected the stabilization to work better than it seemed to at first, as I shot casual critter shots.  Then I discovered the setting for children and pets.  That has helped considerably.  Practice and experimentation will no doubt teach me to use the camera more effectively in other ways, as well, in the months ahead.

By the way, I dont like the Canon Zoombrowser software at all.  I use it only to download from the card (rather than directly from the camera), and then I switch to a different software program for editing.

Good size for someone with larger hands but compact enough to keep in coat pocket.

<Content>I purchased a CanonPowershot 
SX110IS for my daughter for Christmas.  The price listed was 149.99.  I ordered believeing that the camera was in stock.  About a day later I received notice that the camera would be delivered in March.  This was way too long to wait so I proceeded to cancel the order.  Lo and Behold, the camera was now in stock at a price of 199.00!!!  I went ahead and ordered the second camera and cnaceled the first one, but I feel that I was caught.  I believe that Amazon knew that all the customers who wanted the camera for Christmas would pay the extra 50.00 just to get it. The camera is just what she wanted, but I wonder how the company could go from having the camera at 149.99 (delivery in late Feb. or early March) and then in the space of several days suddenly have the camera at 199.99---immediate delivery. Interesting, dont you think? </Content>

<Content>This camera is everything I had hoped for in a mega-zoom, compact digital. Over the past month, Ive been able to really test it out, and it hasnt let me down even once. 

The 10x optical zoom is not a 10x digital zoom, it is true optical zoom with excellent lenses. Some of the other 10x (mega-zoom) camera were reviewed to have poor exposure results through their lenses, surprisingly this included Nikon. The Canon performance is awesome. The effective pixels total 9 mega-pixels, plenty of pixel density on a .28cm sensor. The main sensor is a CCD type that measures 0.28 sq cm. There is a huge LCD on the back and the screen is awesome with lots of detail and a built-in portrait-to-landscape accelerometer (orientation sensor). The flash is manual which means you just flip the flash up if the display says you need it; leave it down if you dont need it--no fumbling for buttons to set the flash preference. I havent be disappointed by the shots Ive taken on auto yet. With face detection, just a light touch on the exposure button, the face detection senses the faces in your shot and focuses perfectly. Then mash the button and get a great shot every time. Easy to learn right out of the box. Nothing complicated about this camera. If you want aperture or shutter priority, youll have to spend more. This camera is the best value I was able to find for the features and Ive been really impressed with the quality of the prints that Ive made on top-quality photo paper. The video is awesome, even on a 52 plasma. Were using this camera exclusively and pretty much shelved our Canon DV video camera.

The research that informed my choice included Amazon reviews, JR Photo reviews, Consumer Reports, Digital Camera Review, Canon Web site, Nikon Web site and the Sony Web site. In my research, I looked at the most critical things that mattered to me. Sensor size and mega-pixels ratings can be confusing and deceiving. The higher the number doesnt necessarily mean better shots, especially if youre comparing a compact with a subcompact. I used the buying guide at Digital Camera Review extensively to narrow down to the compacts with the best performance features and to make sure I was comparing apples to apples.

I compared camera in the Consumer Reports ratings, and though I found that they didnt seem to pay much attention to CCD sensor size in their ratings, as always, the review was very informative and helped narrow down the top brands for features, performance and reliability.

Once I had a narrowed down list of a few cameras that looked like they had the best mix of features, performance, usability, price and quality, the clear winner was this Canon. Plus the fact that I have had excellent experiences with other Canon electronics, I chose the SX110. 

Bottom line, this camera takes great pictures and video. Ive photographed and shot video at the max of 60 feet from my subject with excellent results. Ive photographed in low light, too, and as long as youre relatively still, great results with minimal blur. Ive been amazed at how much Ive been able to shoot without the flash. The flash does produce some red-eye, but it is possible to fix it with a feature right on the camera. I use a Mac Book Pro with iPhoto, and the compatibility is ideal. Im sure the same is true with PCs.

The first shot delay is almost not even noticeable; very quick and second shot recovery after using the flash is great.

I also recommend getting a 4GB memory card and a Sanyo Eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargable Batteries w/ Charger.</Content>

<Content>Love It!  This is my 1st Digital Camera.  I was wanting a camera to use basically for family, sports, and outdoor shots.  I took my selection down to 2 cameras - this one, the Canon Powershot SX110IS and the Sony Cybershot DSC-H-10 Digital Camera.  I really liked the Sony and probably would have purchased that one, except they advertise a 3 screen, but the images shown on the screen only used 2 of the screen.  There is a black border on top and on bottom, just like the wide screen movies on your TV.  Plus there is no lens cover.  One of my requirements was to have a 3 screen, which I love.  The 10x zoom is great; pictures are clear and beautiful.  The only issues that may bother some are:  1)  Slight delay on 1st shot  2)  The Flash has to be manually raised; This is a great camera and would definitely recommend it to others. </Content>

<Content>This is a great little camera.  Nice large lcd screen, easy point and shoot for stills and quick dial turn for video. There is not a view finder, so the lcd is the only option.  Manual flash flip up, but that is barely worth writing about.  Great zoom.  On photos that I took from max zoom, they didnt turn out grainy at all.  My last digital camera was top of the line eight years ago.  The fact that is was 8 yrs old may be part of the reason I am so thrilled with the Canon.  HA!  Even so.  This is a great camera for the price.  The size is a bit larger than the other pocket cameras but for the zoom lens, its worth it.

I did my research online, and I came across this one. The best thing is that it has an optical zoom like a professional camera, but its very compact. I also considered in getting a very compact camera such as a sony cybershot, but it didnt have the specs that I wanted. I definitely love this one.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera because of Canon brand which besides 9 MPix had very good zoom (10 Optical).This is my first Canon, I have used Kodak Digital Camera in the past. But I would say I am not satisfied with the results I got from Canon. 

Barring battery life (better use rechargable batteries than the alkaline), the biggest drawback which turned me off is the flash (its pop up flash which I thought may be better than inbuilt imbedded ones) which makes indoor/night images yellowish in color.Maybe thats why it is priced at lower side. I am not a professional or expert but I would definitely disagree with those who are giving this camera 5 stars.  

I would say that video quality was satisfactory. The day light images were satisfactory and I used to get quite nice images with my old Kodak Camera (4 MPix) too. 

My old Kodak camera with inside flash gave better indoor/night pictures, with no yellowness to the images what so ever.

<Content>This is my first digital camera. My prior camera was a Canon Rebel, which I loved.
The powershot is a nice first digital camera, but it cannot compare to the rebel I had. First, I feel the consumer should know up front that the memory card that comes with this camera holds maybe 15 shots and that a memory card must be purchased with it. Second, the night or dark shots look like day, it doesnt keep the night in the picture. Im still learning the camera and maybe can find how to fix this. But the 3 viewfinder is great and its still a nice camera for the money. </Content>

<Content>Takes clear pictures with great color and clarity.  Ive owned it about a month and used it during Christmas to take pics and video of kids, etc.  Also took it on a trip to visit family/friends.  We havent used many manual settings yet, but only because we havent had a chance to read the instruction manuals.  Im sure they would be just as easy to use as the rest of the features have been thus far.  
I love the fact you can zoom while taking videos.  
We use Energizer rechargable AAs and they last for days.
The price I paid here is about $50 less than any store Ive found it in.

Just a couple of issues: the most notable is the time it takes before you can snap the next picture.  Its sometimes a problem when you want quick shots, but maybe theres a way around it after I read that manual??  
Its a little bulky and heavy, but worth it to me for the larger buttons and features than the smaller point-and-shoots.  I found a nice compact carrying case made for GPSs that fits it well.
Im hoping itll last many years to come!</Content>

<Content>I was looking for a replacement to my SD600 that went down for the count with the famed lens error.  Not wanting a full-blown DSLR I figured this somewhat pocketable superzoom might do the trick but no luck.

First off, this has a manual flash.  A manual flash...in 2009?  Why?  

Second, this is bulkier to carry around than four SD600s, thats right, four of them!

Third, the LCD is set waaay too bright, even on the dimmest setting.  Goodbye battery life...

...and fourth, since Im on the batteries, it conveniently runs off 2 AAs but the flash recharge time (time between shots) is the slowest of any camera Ive used in over 20 years - film or digital!  While the flash is recharging, you cant even take other non-flash pictures.  Sigh, why Canon, why?

As a result of the flash recharge and screen brightness defects I returned the camera after just one day.  For what its worth, the few pictures I took were reasonably clear but even with the image stabilization they were no better than those taken with my old SD600.  Back to the drawing board for me.  If you can live with its shortcomings, the superzoom is nice, but I found the deficiencies too much to bear.</Content>

<Content>Updated - March 9th 2009

This camera is good overall, giving more features than the average point-and-shoot camera.

Pros:

+10x Optical Zoom
+Great Macro quality
+Good Flash
+Large LCD Screen
+Lots of manual control usually not found on many PS cameras. This camera allows for Aperture Priority, Shutter Speed Priority, Custom ISO settings, Manual Focus, or complete manual control over all of these features.
+Good build quality
+Image Stabilizer (definitely helps when using the optical zoom)
+Standard Mini-USB port
+Backup battery for clock and settings (so you dont have to reset the clock when replacing the batteries or the SD Card which is located next to the batteries)
+ SD/SDHC card slot
+Face recognition (which is easy to quickly turn on or off with the press of one button)
+Runs off two AAs. Both a good and a bad thing, although mostly good since you can change batteries when in the field or find extras at a local shop.
+Direct-Print to printer with a USB cable (Ive never used this, but could be useful and convenient for some)

Cons:

-Okay battery life. Battery can be used quickly  when using the flash a lot or using optical zoom often. Setting the LCD brightness down can help. I bought High-Capacity rechargeable AA batteries and these helped a lot. I wouldnt recommend cheap AAs though. Its worth investing money in good rechargeable batteries.
-No optical viewfinder
-Optical zoom cant be used with recording video (once started.) You can zoom in then start recording, but not while its going.
-Grainy at high ISO speeds (although this is typical of PS cameras.) Anything up to 400 looks nice, but its noticeable at 800 and 1600 and 3200 arent usable at if you care about quality.
-Not very compact and a little heavy. While this is fine for me (I like the form factor) this camera may not be for  someone who wants a thin light-weight camera.

While Im just an amateur photographer, this camera is definitely is worth its money for its impressive picture quality, optical zoom, and features. While the graininess at higher ISO settings is sometimes noticeable, this is common for point-and-shoot cameras. Some may ask why bother with this camera if you can get a 10+ or so Megapixel camera for about the same price or cheaper, its simple... the SX110 IS takes great pictures, has 10x optical (which is very important in comparison to digital) zoom, and provides many features not found in most point-and-shoot cameras. Megapixels are not benchmark of the quality of the pictures, but rather the size (resolution.) If you want an advanced nice PS with extra features, but dont want to buy an SLR, then this might be the camera for you. If you plan on getting serious and want to take action shots that require higher ISO settings, consider an entry level SLR such as the Nikon D40. The D40 is around $450.</Content>

<Content>Bought this camera for my wife, so far she loves it.
It takes great pictures, even at night or indoors or concerts.
its smaller than other comparable cameras.
it has auto settings, but it also has a great range of manual settings
a couple reasons I picked this particular camera are that:
 it takes regular SD cards, which are getting really cheap(no Sony  pro-stick or anything crazy.)I paid 15 bucks for an 8 gig card on amazon
 it uses aa batteries.  Thats great because good rechargeables are fairly inexpensive and we can keep several sets ready to go.  And if we are out somewhere and run out, we can snag some alkalines anywhere 

My only dislike is that it can take a while to process a picture if the lighting isnt perfect</Content>

<Content>Here are my first impressions on SX110 IS:
- Auto mode photos are decent; nothing short of or better than other point and shoots.
- The zoom clearly works. Ive always had cams with less than 4x optical zoom before, so this one does show the stark difference. I have been able to click good photos of mountains that are anywhere between 10-30 miles from the point of clicking, while zooming on objects close by shows amazing details of the objects which I have not been able to capture with other lower optical zoom cams.
- Focusing is good. With my previous cameras, Ive had a 30% rate of good photos vs. bad ones. With this one I think the number must be above 75%.
- Other shooting modes are excellent. For example, none of the photos Ive taken in sepia mode are below average. Surprisingly though the camera lacks the color accent and color swap modes seen on other Powershots.
- Battery life is average. But with spare rechargeable batteries (i.e. a total of 2+2=4), clicking up to 300 photos should be possible.
- Flash is where the only problem Ive found yet it. It feels very slow to recharge, and thus taking multiple pics in succession in a short time is difficult. 
Im yet to explore more, and maybe Ill update this once I have done so.</Content>

<Content>I just received the SX110IS last week and have been playing around with it.  I researched this purchase extensively, so Ill share a few thoughts about that as well as my experience so far with the camera.  Im a pseudo-serious amateur photographer who produces and shoots some video professionally.

My criteria for selecting a camera was as follows:

  -- I wanted a very portable camera with great image quality to upgrade my trusty A530 at a maximum price of $200.  (I think that spending any more than this on a point and shoot is a waste of money -- youll never get the qualities of a quality dSLR, or a cheap film point and shoot, like shallow depth of field no matter how much you spend.)

  -- I plan on upgrading my DSLR to a full-frame model with high definition video capability in the next year or so, so I wanted something now that was portable enough to carry in my shoulder bag or coat pocket (but not necessarily my shirt or pants pocket).

  -- I valued advice from Consumer Reports, Steves Digicams, and dpreview.com reviews (as well as savvy Amazon reviewers!).

  -- I wanted at least some manual controls, optical image stabilization and at least a 4x zoom.

  -- My bias was toward good low-light capability (although I understand the limitations of compacts) and AA-battery capability.  I really dislike proprietary batteries.  They tend to die a slow death, putting you in the frustrating position of deciding when youve had enough of their diminishing capacity and need to search for a replacement.  You have to buy and carry a spare at all times and purchase a third one after a year or so, which adds at least $60 to the cost of the camera plus hassle.  (New technologies in NiMh rechargeable batteries like Eneloop are versatile, economical, high performing and more environmentally friendly.)

  -- The video size had to be at least 640x480 with a frame rate of at least 30fps.  I was hoping for high-definition video capability, but still-image quality was paramount.

Just based on image quality and portability, I considered a handful of different models, like the Panasonic Lumix TZ5 (proprietary battery, so-so dynamic range, but great portability and high-def video), Canon A590 (can you believe they downgraded the 640x480 video to 20 fps?  A non-starter for me), Canon A2000 (max aperture of 3.2 is too small, plus no manual controls like aperture-priority mode) and Canon SD1100 (great size and interesting video features, but lack of manual controls), and the one listed here, the Canon SX110.  I had a hard time choosing, and finally went with the SX110.

Ive been using the SX110 for a couple of weeks now.  The image quality, when light is adequate, is nice, and the zoom is fantastic given the cameras size.  Ive done some side-by-side shots with my A530, and the image detail and low-light capability of the SX110 is quite lovely.  (I have to say that its downright depressing when compared to my cheapie Canon Rebel 35mm film camera with a 50mm lens on it--hence my comment about not spending very much on a digital point and shoot!)  

At the end of the day, the SX110 is a great package overall with respect to optics and functionality.  However, the build quality of this camera gives me cause for concern, despite the fact Im VERY gentle with all my equipment.  Aside from the entire camera housing feeling very cheap (much less sturdy than my cheap old A530), which is something that I could get over, there are two major problems:  

1) The little video out door on the side of the camera, once opened, will not shut completely and stay closed.  It seems the latch to keep it closed isnt engineered right, or else it must have broken the first time I opened the door.  I thought it wasnt a big deal, but the fact that this little door is always ajar is a real pain (e.g., it catches on things because it just falls open when you tilt the camera on its side).  

2) The sliding door that contains the batteries and memory card is extremely hard to open.  It appears to have the same basic mechanism as my A530, but it is infinitely harder to operate.  I can do it, using two hands and inserting my fingernail to move the door over, but it really feels like Im forcing it, and I can guarantee it will break after a dozen or so times.  And that door cant afford to be opening unexpectedly!

I dont know if I got a lemon, or if this is what I should expect out of this camera, but it is definitely going back.  This weekend Ill stop in a local store who I know carries it and see if I encounter the same issues with their display model (Ill update this posting when I have more information).  For now, I feel like being generous so Im giving the camera four stars.  It could go to five stars if I get a replacement model that has functioning doors, or to one star if that camera doesnt exist.  If thats the case, Im going to take my money, replace my Olympus Stylus Epic film camera that got stolen, and go back to using film for my snapshots.  Im almost frustrated enough to abandon any hope of a digital point and shoot that comes close to the same league as a film point and shoot.  Hope this information helps somebody in the meantime!</Content>

<Content>I received this camera for Christmas.  My mother-in-law had a Kodak EasyShare which is GREAT!  It takes the most remarkably clear pictures for a point and shoot.  She could not find that camera for me, so the Canon SX110 IS was recommended.  It takes very fuzzy pictures in low light and the stability is not good.  There was a world of difference between her pictures and those taken with the Canon (taken at the same place, same light, etc.).  After research, I have opted to go with the Panasonic DMC-FZ28K which has remarkable reviews.  After I receive it, I will let you know.

In the meantime, if you are going to spend $200+ on a camera, there are certainly ones better than this.  I would take a little time and do some research - but the Kodak EasyShare is definitely a better buy.</Content>

<Content>I needed a good macro mode (close-up capability) to use at work to take photos of quality issues with our product (sometimes circuit boards).  Ive uploaded a close-up of a circuit board.  The macro mode can focus to less than half an inch.  In fact, the lens will focus so close, that eventually the lens is blocking the surrounding light.  If you can set the camera on something solid during a close-up shot, then you can crank up the f-stop to the maximum of F8 for excellent depth of field.  </Content>

<Content>This camera is very nice with its big LED screen, ease of use and image quality. However, it is a little heavy with its AA batteries. The batteries dont last long either- maybe for just an hour or two of total usage and the flash takes a considerable amount of time to recover for the next shot, which quickly becomes irritating. It has a nice macro feature, but I have found the auto focus to be a bit inconsistent. The manual zoom is a bit difficult to use, instead I take 10 pictures with auto focus to get one or two nice macro shots. The zoom is awesome as well as the range of features, and it takes large/good quality video. This camera is a bit much for everyday photos of kids and such, but if you plan to use it for hobby photography as well it would be worth it.  </Content>

<Content>Personally, I think I purchased too much camera! I was looking for an easy point and shoot with a good zoom. The camera is a little bigger than I expected and already presented a problem when I was out with my friends and family. I kept putting the camera away instead holding on to it.  The time in between pics for the flash to recharge is unacceptable! After reading so many reviews it seems the cameras with AA batteries tend to have a delay in between pics, why I dont know.  That alone has steered me away from this camera. Im a mom of 2 active boys and I wanted a camera thats easy to take along, take quick pics and easy to learn. The camera however, does take amazing pics and great video.  However, a ton of my pics came out blurry, especially if I didnt remember to lift up the flash which I never did.  There is just too much too learn with this camera and just too many features and setting. A little too overwhelming for me. Curious as to why the flash recharge is so long? Does anyone know? So Im returning this camera and getting my SD750 fixed for the $100 Canon is going to charge me or Im getting the A590is, not sure. Suggestions welcomed.</Content>

<Content>Well, I do like this camera, especially the 10x zoom, but one thing about buying stuff on-line is, you dont get to put your hands on anything.  I would recommend going to a camera store 1st to check out these cameras before you buy.  This one is actually somewhat larger than I had anticipated which for our active lifestyle is very important.  Good pictures, especially the video, but Im not 100% thrilled with it.  The problem these days are there are SOOO many to choose from, so I would do your research 1st, check at Amazons for users reviews, then go touch the cameras at the store.  I think that will really help in choose the best camera for you.

<Content>Pros:
-The optical zoom is really great for a camera of this size and price
-The battery life is very good - I had initially thought that the battery comsumption would be too high, with only 2 batteries (my previous Canon used 4 batteries)
- Many other more that other reviewers have submitted

Con:
-The only one negative thing is that the optical zoom does not work during the video mode.  Only the digital zoom works (which is rather useless).  But for a camera of this price and size, I can understand.

Note: Buyers from outside of the USA to note.  The warranty that comes with it only works in the USA and Canada.  This did not matter to me as the one year warranty was not my priority, as Canon usually can last many years.  </Content>

We were at a playoff football game up in box seats on the opposite side of the field...and were able to zoom across the field into the stands and get AWESOME pics of our kids in the stands, as if they were just standing a few feet away! Quite impressive! 
We have had some problems with blurry pictures in certain situations, havent figured out why yet...any suggestions anyone??? But overall we love our new Canon!</Content>

<Summary>Canon Powershot SX110IS 10x</Summary>
</Review>
<Review>
<DocID>B001EQ4C8U-192</DocID>
<Content>Ive read almost all the reviews here, and there is nothing major for me to add. I do have some minor points to add, however. I am using this camera for more than a month now, and overall I am very pleased, even though a few things does bother me.

First of all, I miss the wide angle zoom. Canon released the G10 and the SX10 (20x super zoom) at the same time along with the SX110, the other 2 got the wide-angle lens, but not the SX110. Why? I would anytime pick a wide-angle and 9x zoom over the 10x zoom.

Also, Canon features the new Digic 4 processor on the other 2 cameras, while in the SX110 it is still the older Digic III. Its not bad, but I would appreciate the newer technology with the i-Contrast and more.

The SX10 (with 20x zoom) lets you zoom (optical) during video recording; However with the SX110 (and G10) you cant zoom (only with the useless digital zoom).

The biggest problem, as many others pointed out, is the flash recharging time. I had several Canons in the past (point  shoot), and have never encountered such a big delay between shots (when using flash). 

I am upgrading from the PowerShot SD700, which was much faster between shots. The battery also lasted much longer. In overall, I am from those who appreciate Canons battery pack over AA, even though I can not ignore the benefits of AA availability - and this is true even with the rechargeable AAs - I just dont like them.

A major drawback for me was when I found out that there is no battery meter. One of the things I hated in my older SD700 was the lack of a battery meter (it only notifies you when the battery is dead to replace it, no prior notice), and I was happy to see that since the release of the PowerShot SD1100 Canon added the battery meter so you always know how much juice you have left. I was looking forward for that on the SX110 as well... Well, I was wrong. Seems that Canon is unable to meter third party (AA) batteries! What a disappointment!

I also think that there is not enough grip. I would like the battery compartment a tad bigger, and some added rubber. The way its now, its a bit slippery. Also, the battery/card door is a little difficult to open and requires an extra unnecessary step of pulling a little piece before opening.

Another problem is the placement of the little speaker. I find it always covered with my left hand! The area on top left is a natural place for the fingers to sit; the speaker does not belong on this spot!

About the 3.0 LCD - when I first got my SX110, I was surprised at the nice 3.0 LCD - until I compared it to the 3.0 LCD of the Canon G10 which my friend bought at the same time - what a difference! The resolution is so much better on the G10, with double the amount of pixels (460,000 instead of the 230,000 on the SX110). (By the way, the new professional Canon EOS 50D has even double the pixels of the G10, for an unbelievable total of 920,000!!)

Also important to note, that this camera does not feature the EDIT MOVIE feature which most other Canon cameras does. That means no more cropping beginning/end of your clips! I really miss that!

Otherwise, I think this is an excellent overall camera. I am really impressed with the pictures, and theyre better than the SD700, especially in lower light conditions. The image stabilizer also works a lot better. So much more flexible and all the controls are so useful. Manual raise/close flash is excellent and makes it very easy to control flash ON/OFF (and its beyond me why they didnt the same on the G10); the face detection works great, and it will never overexpose a human face even with flash close to the face - which my old SD770 was terrible at it. Noise appears in higher ISO or in dim light conditions, but usually in most situations its perfect, and definitely better than previous Canons. Highly recommended!

<Content>This camera is a great deal but does have some pros and cons.The good stuff first a nice big LCD screen,strong flash for a point and shoot,alot of adjustments you find on higher end SLR models,great image stablization.The camera is vey sleek and compact and the 10x zoom is alot better than a 4x zoom on point and shoots that are around $200.The flip-up flash is both good and bad.You have to remeber to flip it up but if you are taking pictures somewhere you shouldnt use a flash all you have to do is leave it down on other cameras you have to find the flash off.Also on the selector wheel a couple of the most used modes (party,kids with pets,night snapshot,landscape and portait) all have their own notch.On the down side no veiwfinder (but this keeps the camera small) ,it is slow between pictures and some of the buttons are a little bit too sleek and you have to use the edge of your finger to push them best.Canon put alot of nice features into a small and inexpenise camera.The camera itself dosent feel cheap and you would think it would cost much more.Unless you really want to get into photography and buy say a SLR with different lens and pay awhole more look no farther this it the best out there for the money.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera because of the big zoom (10X). It is a great camera, many features, light weight, auto lense cover, takes the normal AA batteries. many many good things. however, it has a couple of negative aspects which are:
- high consumption of batteries, so you need to load up with many batteries (you can use rechargable AA though).
- sometimes it tells me to changes batteries and after a while I foget to put new batteries and I grab it and take 4 or 5 photos it work just fine.
- 10x zoom does not work when you are taking movies movies.

So, if you are looking for good camera with high zoom (for soccer and football games and picnic in the park, it is good choice). pitcure quality is excellent with or without the flash, inside or outside. when I dowloaded my photos on the computer i was amazed of the high quality. Also the movies are high quality. </Content>

<Content>I searched for along time for this kind of camera. (in the $200 range) I was drawn by the 10x zoom and Optical Image Stabilization(IS). (both work great and are very nice to have!) After using it for a few weeks, I have had mixed results. Before you read on, understand that I also shoot with a canon xti, often with a $300 50mm lens on it, so I think my standards might be a little higher than the average user. With that said, here is what I think: 

When you shoot in auto mode, the ISO it chooses (ISO 200) will not be as clear as the camera is capable of. Thus I find you have to use a Program (P) mode and set it to ISO 80 to get better reduced-noise pictures. Otherwise pictures can be grainy. The pictures are poor at ISO higher than 200. 

Focusing is a bit slow in low light, and unless you can balance the camera on something steady, and your subject is not moving, you will need to use the flash. As I have read it on reviews on its predecessor Canon sx100, the recycle time on the flash is somewhat annoying. You will have to wait a good 5-6 seconds before you can ready up for another shot. This is a drag when you have people who are posing, or for a subject that is passing you by, like at an evening parade. The flash is set on or off by manually raising the flash with your finger. No automatic pop-up. Not a problem for me as I dont like using flashes anyways, especially on this camera!!! 

I think the video quality out of this camera is great, far better than what I got out of older Sony Cybershot models DSCW-50 and the DSCW-55. Note that you cannot optically zoom while shooting video; it will let you zoom digitally. 

The upsides for this camera are many. The 3-inch screen is amazing. It does stick out from the back of the camera, rather than being inset, so it may be prone to scratching. The programmable features are excellent. You can adjust the exposure time to 15 seconds. Playback/review is easy and fast, due to a wheel that lets you scroll through pictures quickly. Viewing it on the big screen with auto-rotation (landscape-portrait) makes it easy to check for focusing and such. Macro shooting is amazing. You can practically touch the subject with the lens and get a clear, very detailed shot! 

If you want a quick convenient camera for casual shooting, dont really care about too much zoom, dont get this camera. Get something smaller and faster, and something that comes with a rechargeable lithium battery. I would stick to Nikons, Sonys and Canons. This one takes two AAs, and dealing with those has its pros and cons. I bought this camera for the big 10x zoom for the relatively small size, and the programmable options. I studied studio tests from dpreview.com (great site!) and found this was the best for my needs. The Lumix TZ5 pics looked fuzzy and the design of the Sony H3 is ugly. For other models and side-by-side comparisons, check that site out. Hope this helped you, and good luck on your decision! </Content>

<Content>After researching multiple cameras for an upcoming trip to Peru, I committed to buying the Canon SX110.  I am so happy I did!  The functionality of this camera is superb!  The Canon SX110 offers a variety of features, such as the 10x zoom, that are hard to find in point and shoot camera.  I find this camera to be the perfect middleground between an SLR and point and shoot.  The clarity in each picture is stunning.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great camera.  The only con that I have is the battery life and the size of the camera.  It is larger than most compact cameras so trying to find a  case for it has been challenging.  I bought the Lith batteries and they lasted 2 days, so make sure to buy the rechargeable.</Content>

<Content>This camera produced incredible pics on our vacation to South Padre Island.  Dolphin watching shots turned out beautifully, and so realistic. It was like being there again. The 10x digital zoom does the best job I have seen on any point and shoot, yet! The pics are crisp and clear beyond belief! It is not heavy or cumbersome to carry with you for those times when an unexpected photo op reveals itself to you. Youll be confident and ready to shoot most anything. The only bad thing we have found, is it seems rather battery hungry.  After a very short amount of time, the low battery warning light comes on, yet the used batteries 
will still power flashlights and similar things. Do yourself a favor and invest in rechargeable batteries and a charger for the  unit and you will enjoy your camera even more than before - if that is even possible. This is a very nice (and faster to focus) companion to my Canon Digital Rebel XTi.</Content>

I needed a camera with a super macro function as I am converting my old color slides (transparencies) to digital.  I just put the slides on the lighted slide sorter and snap away.

Fast!

The camera is slow to recycle after the flash is used...probably because of the AA batteries.  My other Canon is much faster.  Excellent image stabilization.</Content>

<Content>The SX 110IS is an excellent camera for anyone who wants a top end point and shoot camera with an excellent zoom (~35 to 350mm)and the capacity for a lot of creative control.  Im an old school Nikon SLR film camera guy who developed and printed in my own darkroom. I bought and shot with the Canon  SX10IS and found that, while its a good camera with a big zoom, the weight, operating complexity (swiveling display switching with viewfinder and complex control buttons) and smaller display (2.5) were simply not worth the extra $130 for my needs. If you must have 12 megs and multiple lenses, go for it and get an SLR.  Otherwise, this is your camera. One hardware flaw in the SX 110IS is that the exposure compensation display (+0-) is visible in the display of all shooting modes except Auto. Be prepared to see a +0- at the bottom of your display. Canon has confirmed to me that this is a hardware issue and that there is no way to remove the zero from the display unless you switch to Auto.     </Content>

<Content>     As an owner of several Canon digital cameras throughout the past 10 years, Id have to say that I am really pleased with Canons latest prosumer camera.  It really captures the needs of a lot of different users, from great advanced features and access to setting modification for those who like to dabble with the outcome of their shots, to a large and vibrant display that will satisfy any mom or pop at Jonnys soccer game.  Over time, Canon has trimmed its on-board buttons and menus down to a VERY useable and accessible set, now rivaling the super-easy to use (but not very high quality) Kodak line of point and shooters.  
 
 The picture quality on this guy rivals my Canon 30Ds quality on automatic settings in both incandescent indoor shooting as well as outdoor shooting, but have not put the high ISOs to the test.  

 The face detection feature is really nice; it does a nice job of picking up on the faces in a shot, so you do not have to try to manually focus.  Again, very nice for Gramma to take great looking shots.

It seems like there had been a boom in DSLR sales in the past few years, with people forking out WAY too much cash for more camera than they need (and end up using in the long run).  If you are one of those folks who are tempted to get into photography more seriously, but really dont have the money to spend on a number of lenses (let alone a decent body), or the time for classes at your local tech school,  this is a really nice camera to consider.  The 10x optical zoom, rarely before seen on a sub-$200 camera, can give you some added push in your shots.  If you insist on looking cooler with a big camera that (until you learn its nuances) will yield shots of equal quality to this one in automatic mode, then Id recommend staying in the Canon family, with a Rebel product or even a 40 or 50D.  Canon really does the best job for the money.

The ONLY minute detail that I would point out to the negative would be the fact that small size coupled with the smooth rounded edges makes it just a bit difficult to grab and shoot if you have big paws like I do. Not a huge drawback, just something to mention.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera after the flash on my last camera quit, and then it just wouldnt turn on anymore. Maybe I am cursed when it comes to digital cameras? I bought this one and the lens broke the next month, and I hadnt even used it much! Just one day when I went to turn it on, it said lens error, please restart camera, and then immediately shut off. I had to send it in for repair, so well see what happens. I dont think that is acceptable for a new camera. 

I will say that before the lens broke, the camera functioned well and took GREAT pictures. I was thrilled with it. </Content>

<Content>Canon Powershot SX110IS 9MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)

I took this camera on a 5 week travel trip across the US and got the most amazing photographs; even a professional photographer was impressed with the clarity, especially when we practiced drive by photography while speeding down the highway at 70mph.  The only drawback is there is no view finder, so after trying to look through the flash attachment a couple of times, I figured out that wasnt going to work.  The zoom is great, and I was able to get pictures of prairie dogs that looked like I was inches away from them. It takes great pictures inside without the flash (actually better than with a flash). If you are looking for a point and shoot camera that gives you a taste of zoom, then this is the one for you.</Content>

This camera takes great pictures in low lighting conditions.  One example...my old Olympus 5 MP camera took horrible pictures of my Christmas tree when lit.  The picture would come out looking like a blurry fireball.  With this Canon, with the flash off in the dark and my Christmas tree illuminated, the lighted tree comes out in perfect clarity.  You can see each individual bulb perfectly clear.  I was amazed.  I will have this camera for a long time.  </Content>

<Content>This camera takes exceptional pictures! Huge 3 viewing screen, and the zoom quality is absolutely amazing! Though you can set it on auto and take great pictures that way, its manual settings allow you to adjust shutter speed, aperture, white balance, and much more to take those beautiful pictures that professional cameras take. 
Ive read reviews that said it eats batteries, but in my experience, thats only if youre constantly using the flash. If your setting are right, you dont need the flash on most the time, unless most of your shooting is done in low/dark light. Frankly, i rarely use the flash unless im in that kind of light setting and my pictures look better for it.
I would NOT recommend this camera for the first time, or casual picture-taker. This camera is best suited for someone who has a growing interest in taking better pictures because while youre learning to use the more advanced features (which takes time and practice) you can still take great shots in the auto setting. 

THREE NEGATIVES: 
1. Its somewhat heavy (which i dont mind but you might). 
2. Also, when you DO use the flash, the viewing delay time is pretty significant. What I mean is as soon as you take a picture with the flash on you will have to wait atleast four seconds to take another picture.
3. There is no eye viewer (im sure thats not the correct term). What i mean is - you can only view your subject on the viewing screen, not by peeking through the eye hole that most cameras have.</Content>

<Content>I did more than my fair share of research before purchasing this camera.  I actually purchased it, exchanged it for a different camera and then came back to this one for its superior quality.  We wanted a camera with a decent zoom and unfortunately, that means you dont get a pocket-sized camera-its a trade-off.  The LCD screen is large and the image is clear and  bright, not grainy like some cameras.  The video feature, which we tried the other day, is a nice add-on.  Yes, you dont have the option to zoom in, but thats why you buy a camcorder. Its a nice feature to have on the camera for those days you dont have that along.  The menu is easy to use and I like being able to adjust as much or as little as I want.  I wasnt sure whether Id like a pop-up flash, but it becomes pretty automatic to put it up and if you dont, the camera reminds you.  Lastly, I like being able to review my pictures without turning the camera on.  There is some lag time after a picture has been taken, but I am still using the memory card it came with while awaiting the arrival of my new one.  Once I have rechargeable batteries (I ordered Eneloop, which was recommended to me) and my Ultra II memory card, I expect to see some difference.  All in all, I am quite happy with this product.  </Content>

<Content>I was looking for an upgrade to my previous camera, the Canon Powershot A75, which had served me extremely well over 4 years. I  purchased an Olympus camera, which despite its high price, I found in my opinion terrible in comparison to my old Canon. 

As the camera was for our honeymoon, I decided to buy another camera. Unfortunately I purchased the Olympus online at a store that does not offer refunds or exchange on poor choice. Expensive lesson learned there.

I purchased the Canon SX110IS from a bricks and mortar store with refund/exchange policy, for peace of mind. Just days before I had recommended friends buy a Canon, and they bought this camera, and when I saw their shots, I knew this was the camera for me. 

Straight away I felt so relieved and happy that I had purchased another Canon. Beautiful shots even on Auto and Easy modes, with lots of other modes and settings to play around with if you wish.

The most important thing about a camera to me is that it takes great pictures on Auto - as I dont like to spend much time playing around, I just like to have fun snapping.

The canon has the same size LCD as the Olympus, but the quality of the pixels is MUCH better, and clearer. 

Image Stabiliser is excellent, (it stabilises the LENS, not the camera body like other cameras),sometimes my hands get shaky with some pictures, but they still come out absolutely beautifully. 

The colour is amazing, pictures are crisp and sharp, even in low light. I took pictures in a completely dark room and they came out great. I dont mind waiting for the flash to recharge,it does not let you take pictures till it is recharged. In the Olympus I erroneously bought, you had no idea whether the flash was charged or still charging, so you could make the mistake of taking shots too quickly in low light.  

The camera body feels very sturdy in your hands and you can easily grip it, your hand can wrap around where you see the silver bit, near the words PowerShot SX110. This is in contrast to slimline cameras that probably look prettier this camera. Id rather have sturdy, especially with such a big lens and zoom. I was, however, surprised when I saw the camera in the flesh it is a lot smaller than I imagined.

Dont worry about lifting the flash (Where canon is written), its not a bother at all, and the camera (at least in Auto and Easy mode) suggests you lift the flash when it deems it appropriate. If you lift it and have the flash on auto, it wont fire unless required. I just lift the flash whenever I take pictures, but it will only fire when needed. 

Canon have improved their picture program for the computer too, but some people may not think the program gives you enough to play around with and may seek other programs. 

One thing that i think would be neat would be the ability to change pictures to black and white or sepia on the camera. That is about the only thing that Olympus did that the Canon didnt do thousands of times better. 

Overall, I think the cameras brilliant. I will never buy anything but Canon again.</Content>

<Content>I recently bought this camera after fighting with the decision to go with a Sony Cybershot DSC-H10 8.1MP or go up in size and get the Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP. I chose to stick to a smaller size camera so I would take it with me most places instead of leaving the bigger camera at home. So even though I love all the features of the Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP its just too big for me right now.

First I would like to point out that this is a point and shoot camera, designed for everyday pictures and some advanced shots if you have the know how. We would all love to get the hand held digital camera that can take stunning SLR pictures but unfortunately that still doesnt exist. This camera with the right equipment and experience can come close though.

I have to disagree with those that are saying the battery life is short. I have had very good battery runs, including the batteries that were supplied with the camera. So far this has been one of the best point and shoot cameras I have ever used. Here are my run downs: 

Pro: 
-Great image quality, I mean really superb. Can go to ISO 400 and still be a good enough to print pictures. After that your going to need some clean up with an editing software or noise will be too prevalent. 

-Fast response time from power up to shot. In between shots it depends on what level flash you use, the brighter the flash the longer it will take to recharge the flash. This problem, however, is in just about all cameras of this caliber. Even the sony and canon SX10 would take 5-7 seconds to recharge after a full flash was used. I have a sony alpha and that flash drains sometimes takes 4 or more seconds to catch up. 

-Great LCD. I have it at half brightness and its more than enough in almost any situation. 

-Easy to learn operation, dont believe me, just set it to easy and itll do all the work and be right most of the time. 

-Nice solid feel to it.

-Prints have been excellent and full of color.

Cons:
 -I wish the f/stop would go below 2.8. Thats just me maybe.

-Even though I know the flash will take a few seconds to recharge, I wish someone could come up with a way to make that faster. It would save some missed pictures. 

All in all its a great camera. Easy to use and not so bulky that you wont take it with you everywhere. I carry mine in belt pouch and have been lucky I had it for some great pictures, that yes would have looked slightly better with my dslr, but I wouldnt have gotten them at all if I didnt carry my dslr with me. 

Highly recommend it and am probably going to get one for my wife so shell stop taking mine. </Content>

I was a little unsure of use of AA batteries instead of a lithium ion battery.  And that was the ultimate downfall of this camera.  I went through the two AA batteries each day of use.  This can get quite pricey.  I loved the zoom and the large screen, but I did find a few dead pixels on the left part of the screen.  I could have lived with the dead pixels, but again the battery life was deal breaker.  Canon definitely got this wrong with this camera</Content>

<Content>*4.5 Star Rating*

My first digital camera was a Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-W50.  I dropped it a lot, and after 2 years of prodigious beatings it finally gave out on me.  It was nice while it lasted, but one thing is for sure, I hated the fact that I could not zoom while recording in movie mode.  

I received that Cyber-Shot 2 years ago, and when I recently researched Sony Cameras, I found out that they still did not offer zoom in movie mode, even in their top of the line equipment.  

So my first priority when researching a new camera was to make sure Optical or Digital zoom was available while recording video.  I researched every camera on the market, and after such extensive research, Canon was at the top of my list, followed by Nikon and Panasonic.  

It took me about a week to finally reach my decision, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.  Canon Digital cameras are top of the line, and most of them offer digital zoom in movie mode, and the Canon SX10 even offers 20x Optical zoom in movie mode, but it was too rich for my blood.

At the end of the day, the Canon SX110IS had everything I wanted and more.  The things I was looking for were:

1.  Zoom enabled in movie mode.

2.  3 inch LCD at 230,000 megapixels.

3.  Manual mode.  (So I could prepare for Professional SLR cams)

4.  Long range zoom in still mode, between 5x-20x.

5.  AA cell operated.

6.  8-15 Megapixels.

7.  28mm Wide Angle Zoom Lens

The Canon delivers 6 of the options I wanted and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5 delivers 5 of the options I wanted.  The DMC-TZ5 is equipped with options 1,2,4,6, and 7, while the Canon is equipped with all of those options, except 7. 

We might also note that the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5 records movies in HD, and has Optical zoom enabled in movie mode, while the Canon SX110IS does not offer HD quality movies, and only has the Digital zoom in movie mode.  

If you do not know the difference;  For an easy summary, Digital zoom magnifies the target but distorts the picture as you zoom closer, while Optical zoom magnifies the target, and as you zoom closer it keeps the image as sharp and clear as possible.  The Canon can only shoot still shots using the 10x Optical zoom.  

In movie mode, it only offers the 4x Digital zoom, which is not that bad, considering I had no zoom at all in my Sony Cyber-shot.  I have no quibble with the Digital zoom; I use it, and the picture quality looks fine to me.    

I went with the Canon because even though I wanted the 28mm wide angle zoom (and the HD video quality, along with Optical zoom was tempting), I was willing to sacrifice those options for the full manual controls and AA cell operation (and this might only be a rumor, but I heard the Panasonics picture quality didnt come close to the Canon).  The Panasonic does not offer any manual mode/controls, which wouldve been an impediment to my learning in order to advance to professional SLRs.  

I especially like having a camera that is powered by AA batteries.  I recently went to an auto show here in Los Angeles, and I took around 300 pictures (with flash), and when my batteries ran out, I had 2 more AAs to back me up (Sanyo Eneloop, rechargeable (highly recommended)).

But even if I didnt have any of my rechargeables on me, I could have went to any concession stand and purchased a pair.  But with a propriety (custom battery), I wouldve been out of luck.

The cons of this camera are as follows:

1.  The flash can take forever to recharge sometimes.  At the auto show, the cars spin around on a platform, and when you snap one shot with the flash, you could be looking at 10.3 seconds before your next shot (if the camera had to use the full power of the flash), but then youll have to wait for the car to spin back around to the position that you wanted.

I watched as my neighbors with their thousand dollar cameras, snapped shot after shot, every half second with full power flashes, and never had to stop and wait.  Of course, cheaper cameras offer those functions, but not every other feature I was looking for to go along with it.

2.  There is no in camera picture edit, but thats ok, because Canon provides 3 software programs you can use to edit your photos which work perfectly for trimming, cropping, and sharpening, etc.  You can turn on Red Eye Correction in the camera, though.

3.  No optical viewfinder, which can really come in handy when you want to conserve power.  But at the same time, I didnt want an optical viewfinder; I wanted a 3-inch LCD.  Most optical viewfinders on cameras within this price range are going to be WAY off targeting (about %80 accurate), but will come in handy when you dont have a place to purchase batteries.

4.  If Canon wouldve went with 28mm wide angle zoom with this camera, Id be in heaven.

Those are the only things I didnt like.  But trust me, the picture quality is so superb, that even when the camera recommends you use the flash, you dont have to, and your pictures will still come out excellent (as long as you had the right settings); so also the functionality, wide range of options, and the manual mode also make your experience highly enjoyable.

I also recommend that you buy at least an 8gb memory card.  I purchased the SanDisk, Ultra 2, which is class 4 in speed.  I uploaded around 300, superfine (highest quality), pictures to my computer within 3-4 minutes.

For only $200 bucks, the Canon SX110IS is easily worth the buy.  Check out the images I upload from the car show.  

I check my comments often, so ask any questions if youre still unsure on which camera to go with.

And lastly, I dont know why people are rating this camera at 2 and 3 stars, but most of the reviewers sounded like they didnt know what they were doing.  But I do know one thing;

Jesus is God.

<Content>I have loved this camera since I bought it in July 2008. I have been able to get nice shots, the zoom is great, the macro works on Auto mode. It is not so fast taking shots. And lately the wheel has become stuck or really hard to rotate, the left click on the wheel is not working anymore, so no more macro feature, no searching previous photos is possible anymore. Since the wheel is used to select or use most features, the camera has become really hard to use. So if you are really careful I think it could work fine. May be Im not the most careful of the people but I know electronics I use last long, and I wasnt lucky with this camera on that matter. I havent tried to contact customer service or send it for service, but I will and Ill let you know.</Content>

<Content>Im a Canon fan, no doubt about it -- and this camera is yet another reason why.  Canon continues to make high quality cameras, packed with features, for a reasonable price.  I previously owned a Digital Rebel SLR (300D) and a pocket Powershot S410.  The S410 was starting to show its age, and I was tired of dragging out the big ole SLR just to take a random picture or two here or there.  I decided it was time to replace both cameras with a single camera that can offer me a lot of the best features of both of the previous cameras.

The 10x zoom on this camera is fantastic.  This is a longer zoom range than I had on my normal walk-around SLR lens on my Rebel.  It will definitely come in handy when walking around outdoors.  The 9mp sensor creates nice quality photos.  Yes, the noise level in higher ISO photos can be noticeable, but frankly that is kinda expected in most smaller cameras with smaller sensor sizes -- its the nature of the beast.  The size of the camera is great.  Its larger than my S410, but still small enough that I can toss it in my jeans pocket and walk around with it if I want.  The screen on the back is huge and quite nice.  Its also nice to have a 640x480 @ 30fps movie mode, though I highly doubt Ill use it very often.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera because I wanted something in between a portable camera and an SLR.  The SX110IS fits this requirement perfectly, and it delivers great bang for your buck.

PROS:
Awesome picture quality
Equally awesome large LCD screen
Even more awesome 10X zoom (In my mind, this is really what makes this camera compete with all those expensive SLRs)
Easy to navigate between functions
Small enough to fit in your pants pocket or your ultra awesome flourecent green and pink fanny pack.

CONS:
Pictures often come out blurry unless you have the flash up or unless youre in bright sunlight (and using the flash never seems to capture images in their true color).  This can be pretty frustrating.

Charge time on the flash is about 4 seconds.  This didnt seem long to me when reading reviews before buying this camera, but when you absolutely need to take a picture - the flash may leave you hanging.</Content>

<Content>Ive had the SX110 for about a month, and I highly recommend it. Its a bit bulky, but makes up for it with the 10x zoom. While not an SLR, the camera does feature a full manual mode where you can set focus, aperture, and exposure time. The digital image stabilization does a great job of keeping your photos blur-free too. 

The only downside is that the CCD is a bit noisy. You cant crank the ISO up above 400 without suffering serious image quality losses.

<Content>I previously had a Canon S2 IS as I wanted the 10x optical zoom. I was incredibly disappointed that after 2 years, the lens jammed. Called an error 18. Upon doing research I learned it is a common problem with the Canon lens. Customer service was less than acceptable. I still wanted a zoom lens and shopped around for price point, size, optical zoom. I was a little gun shy with Canon and compared the camera to its competitor which I believe is the Lumix. I ended up getting Canons new version of the 10x zoom. It increased the mp to 9 which is good. This camera is much smaller which is great. The pictures are good and so far I dont have any complaints. I am still learning about the camera and have not yet played with all the features. My concern is the shelf life with regard to this lens as I do use the camera frequently. If this lens tanks on me I will no longer be a Canon Camera owner. So, at this point I would recommend the camera with re: to size, picture quality, optical zoom options and image stabilization. The price point is very reasonable.</Content>

<Content>Im a fairly serious hobby photographer and have used the previous model Canon SX100 in addition to the latest SX110. Everything about it is slightly better than the older model, so all the past reviews on the SX100 and praises still apply. The SX110 is like the cheaper version of the Canon G10 (minus RAW, wide angle, flash hotshoe, and build quality), but the CHDK mod could close the gap even more with advanced features. Heres my summary of likes and dislikes:

Likes:

- Superb image quality for a compact camera, lens corner to corner sharpness, minimum color fringing, and detail vs noise tradeoff are all better than other cameras in its class.

- Manual controls (PASM), exposure compensation, contrast/saturation/sharpness adjustments, custom white balance, flash intensity are all adjustable.

- 3 LCD screen with 230k resolution, average specs for new generation cameras today. Viewable from a wide angle, and visible in bright sunny conditions.

- 9 Megapixels is good for most large prints, more megapixels wouldve meant more noise without much improved detail due to physical light diffraction limits.

- Good 10x zoom all the way to 360mm equiv.

- Macro mode focuses all the way close to 1cm (less than half an inch).

- Fast lens, meaning the aperture doesnt get too small as you zoom in so a fast shutter speed can still be used to freeze action far away or in dim conditions.

- Optical image stabilization works well giving about 2 stops advantage.

- AA batteries are great, get the pre-charged (aka hybrid) NiMH and you can get consistently 400-500 shots per recharge. Also dont have to worry about lost charger on a trip. Better for the environment long-term than proprietary batteries that only fit one camera.


Dislikes:

- Wide angle not wide enough (28mm wouldve been better than 36mm)

- Minor barrel distortion at the wide angle, only noticeable when there are straight edges in the frame, they look curved.

- The zoom setting is not displayed, it only pops up briefly when you change the zoom, and its not exact. A better solution wouldve been to always display the 35mm equiv value. Also a zoom resume or preset would be nice, so when camera is powered off and on, it resumes the zoom it was in before. This does happen when the camera powers off to save battery, but not all settings are restored in that situation, such as the drive mode or macro focus settings.

- No optical zoom during video recording and HD video, only 640x480 30 fps highest quality.

- The software interface is outdated and unintuitive sometimes. Turning auto ISO shift on should AUTOMATICALLY shift the ISO (like older SX100), not requiring the press of the print button after half pressing the shutter. Some of the features require a lot of button presses. Also auto-power off mode only has option of off or 3 mins, and lens retract in playback is either immediate or 1 min, there should be values in between.

- Image noise is noticeable at ISO 800  higher, not unexpected for a small sensor camera. Maybe if Canon used a slightly bigger sensor like 1/1.6 instead of 1/2.3...

- No live histogram. For a serious camera with manual controls, live histogram should be an option instead of only available after the image is taken.

- The command wheel is only good for scrolling through a long list, but I wouldve preferred a less finicky button interface. Sometimes its easy to accidentally scroll a value when you meant to press the button or vice versa.

- Flash recycle can take 7-10 seconds after a full power discharge, but not a big deal since I dont use the on-camera flash much (I use natural lighting with higher ISO sensitivities, or an external slave flash triggered by the cameras flash). Its one of the tradeoffs of using AA batteries.

I admit the dislikes are very nit-picky, overall this is a great camera, but Im writing them here so that either Canon or one if its competitors can pick up on these issues and improve on them in future models.</Content>

<Content>I use a camera on a daily basis for work and personal use.  I previously used the Canon Elph and Rebel, and found it challenging to deal with charging or replacing the specialty batteries when traveling remote areas or internationally. With this camera I use either rechargable AAs or the AA batteries made for digital use, and have gotten many hours of use (over a few weeks) out of one set.  It has performed well in low light situations, and is responsive and can take photos quickly if the focus is held.  This camera is very small for its functionality, very light, intuitive to use.  </Content>

<Content>This Canon SX110IS is as great as all the other reviewers say it is so I wont bore you by repeating all its great features. I will only bring up a couple of minor things about this camera. 
Wish List....
1. The SD card slot was not in the battery compartment.
2. It would be nice to able to dedicate the print button (top left on back of camera) to video start and video stop like the Canon ELPH SD1000 is able to do. Turning the top control wheel to video is inconvenient when you want to start filming instantly.
3. Although I dont dislike having AA batteries powering the camera, I would like a solid long lasting rechargeable battery like my SD1000 has. I am suspicious of this 400 shot capability with 2 AAs.
4. One troublesome feature is how easy it is to change the quality of the video with the control wheel on the rear of the camera. A little movement of this wheel changes the video quality and you wont know it until its too late. Changing video quality should have been a drill down menu option instead of a control wheel function. 
The above are minor items and in no way take away the quality this camera has. This camera has nice to have features and not a bunch of silly never used features. I love the automatic lens cap, ability to review shots without turning on the whole camera. I love the solid feel and look of this camera, its well built and small enough to carry around in your pocket or purse. The pictures it takes are Canon quality pictures and to me that means first rate just like my Canon Rebel XT. Ive tried other cameras and they are good but to me Canon is the best.

<Content>Got this camera to my wife for her art works.  This camera has very nice features; high zoom, image stabilization, I was able to get very good images in almost darkness with max zoom and flash from 25.  The regular batteries are a real confidance for me, not to get stuck without batteries just when I need more power, I was going to by the Ricoh R8 which is a great product as well, but because it has a Li-ion custom battery, I have chosen to stick to normal, easy to get batteries, which can be also rechargable if I want.  be sure to have on hand some extra batteries if you are going to places which might make you take many photos.  Even with automatic settings, my wife gets beautiful photos, not to mention the manual settings which can give much more control on the result.  I would like if the camera had rubber where the hand grips it like in the Ricoh R8, but this is a minor thing.
I would buy the same one for my self as well. </Content>

<Content>I have owned this camera for 1.5 months, and am very happy. I am frankly amazed at the flexibility and image quality from a camera at this price point that fits in your pocket. I find myself grabbing it whenever I go for a walk. At a store I compared it to the Panasonic TZ5 and a Nikon super zoom in the same price range. In shots without flash the Canon had far better image quality. (The TZ5 is nifty, but the image quality is mediocre: Its noise reduction really smears the colors.)

The 10X zoom lens is great if you dont mind a small amount of fringing on high contrast edges. The controls are logically laid out and easy to use, yet there is comprehensive manual controls if you need it. The image sharpening is a little overdone for my taste: I recommend shooting in P mode using a custom color profile with the sharpening turned down to the lowest level. The problem is that Canon chose to go light on the noise reduction (a decision with which I agree), but the default sharpening tends to turn low-level noise into spiky artifacts. 

I wasnt expecting much from the video mode, but I must admit that it does well, even in low light conditions, and the sound is surprisingly good. It is a nuisance that you cannot adjust the optical zoom in video mode, since the digital zoom really degrades image quality.

It obviously still has a relatively small sensor with limited dynamic range, so dont expect silky smooth DSLR-like images at medium/low lighting, but at reasonable light levels the images are beautiful.

Highly recommended.

<Content>What I love about this camera is its just plain easy to pick up and use, but its got a load of advanced features that you can learn as you go.

Pick up the SX110 and you can feel how solid and stable it is in your hands.  Okay, its not the new thinner camera, but it still fits nicely into a shirt pocket. 

Right off the bat, all the controls are up top and pretty clearly marked and understandable.  Good for Canon.  I looked at another brand and someone had to clue me in on what BS meant in terms of photography.  It means Best Shot, by the way, but should I have to read the manual to find that out?  The easy settings should be intuitive and they are on the Canon.

The zoom is 10X optical, which means youre going to get clearer zooms than you would with a digitally produced effect.  That ends the jagged edges. 

The 3 LCD is clear as a bell.  Colors are sharp and they stay that way in the pictures.  In order to defeat the automatic white balance correction, you have scene selectors for sunset, snow scene, and night scene among others.  

Anti-shake means the camera will correct for tremors in your hands.  This is great if youre like me and take a lot of scenes from a passenger side window.  

A huge plus is the camera operates on two AA size batteries.  Trust me, this is a very good feature.  We once got ready to go on a whale watching cruise only to discover our fancy cameras proprietary batteries were DOA.  What to do?  No camera store in the vicinity.  We were lucky to find a disposable film camera to take semi-decent shots, but if our camera took AAs we could have bought replacement batteries right off the wharf.  

The only drawback in this camera is the proximity of the flash to the lens.  Even with red eye on, photos of my Siamese cat looked wrong.  We finally took pictures in room light with 1/10th of a second exposure counting on the anti-shake and got EXCELLENT shots of the cats.  

If youre looking for a portable camera thats easy to use and supply, this little Canon is a great camera to look at.  For the money, the features and quality of pictures are excellent!

<Content>I was in the market for a new camera and had always owned Pentax or Kodak. As i researched I noticed Canons get great ratings so I considered a few Canons in my quest for a new digital camera. I also checked out the Panasonic Lumix TZ5, very nice, however I liked the options and features on the Canon SX110 better. One really neat feature it has that I did not see on any of the cameras I looked at was the playback button. You can view the pictures you have taken without powering on the camera, WOW! Besides the awesome pictures this camera takes and how easy it is to use, you can also use the zoom feature while in video mode (most digicams do not do that). Great camera overall, however the only 2 faults I have found is the date can only be imprinted on the picture in postcard mode (think this is 2mp). This is alright for me b/c I use low res for mostly emails and 4x6 prints, however may not be good for people who like to take pics in higher resolutions.  The other flaw is the SLOW flash recycle, you could miss out on some good pics bc of this. I also want to praise amazon.com for the great price which was $55 cheaper than the local retail stores in my area and I received my camera the day after I ordered it! Now thats super fast service!!</Content>

<Content>After many years of using only Olympus cameras, I bought the SX110 as a secondary compact camera and am truly amazed with its quality and feature set:
* The manual controls are great for creative photographers
* Image quality - superb
* Optical 10x zoom is excellent
* Battery life is better than expected (about 3 days of shooting)
* IS works great as well

One problem I saw (which is common to most compact cameras) is some visible noise especially when doing long exposures at night.

All in all, a great buy (and even the price tag was a nice surprise).

<Content>I just saw this camera at a local store.  I am looking to replace my Canon S5iS, which has horrible lag time for focusing with a flash...  This one did much better in that department; still not super fast, but if you want that you have to get an SLR.  

The really cool thing I wanted to mention is the impressive macro feature.  The saleswoman held it so that it was touching my engagement ring, and then so that it was touching a key ring, and it was able to focus on my ring band and on the key itself that close.  That to me is awesome!  I use to work at said camera store and played with all of the cameras features.  This one surpassed all of the ones I tested.  

Also, it has a nice big screen, although a viewfinder would be nice for backup.  However that would cut down on the screen size.  

Another nice thing is it takes 2 AAs, not 4 like my existing Canon.  Overall it is a great camera- it even has manual modes on the dial which is always nice if you know what youre doing with them =)  

Id highly recommend it, but since I dont own it yet I only gave it 4 stars, incase I am missing a negative...</Content>

<Content>This camera marries some of the best features of the Canon S series like zoom and manual flash with the convenience of the A series. This camera is an upgrade of the SX100 and feels much more sleeker than the previous model.

Here is my take on the camera:
 
Strengths:
- 9MP CCD sensor with DigicIII processor, the CCD sensor is 1/2.3 inch which is bigger than the most SD series cameras resulting in better pictures 
- Controls are intuitive and a separate replay start button on the back gives you the flexibility to switch on the camera for playback without extending the lens
- Feels good in the hands, battery compartment gives the camera a better grip, DSLR like black color
- Huge 3 LCD scratch resistant screen makes composing shots easy
- Great 10X optical zoom and 40X digital zoom
- Flash can be flipped up or down as needed, this camera also offers 3 manual flash settings which really helps with portraits
- Sharp pictures - Daylight pictures are excellent and zoom is great for capturing landscapes
- Many modes to shoot - night mode, portrait, landscape, kids and pets, indoors, special scene modes (fireworks, aquarium, foliage, snow, beach etc.) and custom colors too
- 2 extra buttons at the back for changing exposure in 1/3 stops and also adjust for face detection
- Macro mode results in stunning close-ups with outstanding level of detail
- Uses 2 AA batteries, can take 300-400 pics with one set of rechargeable NiMHs and if you run out of battery they are universally available


Limitations:
- Size and bulk makes it inconvenient to carry at all times, this will probably become your vacation/ special occasion camera.
- No optical viewfinder, has not bothered me but can become an issue for some especially in bright sunlight or if you want to conserve battery
- Noise is noticeable beginning at ISO 400, ISO 1600 mostly unuseable
- Cannot adjust focus or optical zoom while shooting in movie mode, you can only zoom in digitally which reduces movie picture quality 
- Typical Canon chromatic aberration (common problem with PS cameras)
- No RAW shooting mode 

Overall, this is a great camera for the price if you want a camera with high zoom, especially for shooting outdoors in good light. It also offers some manual functions as well as flash reduction which helps you take the best picture.</Content>

It is very clear and the stabilized zoom is a huge help in eliminating blurry pictures. If I had any complaints about the camera it is that the time between taking pictures seems to be longer than on other cameras, but the pop up flash is a huge bonus and makes it worth the wait.

<Content>The feature that made me buy this camera was its image stabilization system. Friends who use digital cameras professionally all told me that Canons optical image stabilized zoom system was the best in its price range. Due to a slowly worsening tremor, this has evolved into an important issue. 

The digital zoom is amazingly effective. Recently, I caught a game at Fenway Park. My seat was adjacent to the infamous Green Monster. From that distance, I was able to take photos of players at bat, that captured detailed facial features. I was even able to get some very respectable images of players in action.

The camera settings are easy to use, and equally easy to access. The Auto setting is fairly idiot proof and does a good job under a wide variety of conditions. I found the SX110 to be solid, well built yet still small enough to fit into a laptop carrying bag.

I never imagined that I would buy anything other than a Nikon, but now I  think this was one of the best purchases that I have made in a long time. It delivers on its promises, producing pictures whose quality rivals those of much more expensive digital cameras.</Content>

<Content>This camera probably has the best zoom lens among point and shoots under 300 bucks. The F2.8-4.3 works well with ISO400 without flash for indoors, concerts etc. AA NiMH rechargeable battery will give you over 100 shots without Flash. Flash recycle times are over five seconds. The macro mode pictures are excellent. 

The biggest minus is the cheap feel of the camera. While SX100 was made in Japan SX110 comes from China. My Sony DSC-H10 feels like a tank when compared to SX110. 

SX110 has one stop ISO advantage over Sony thanks to Canons fast lens. For scenes when SX110 picks ISO200, DSC-H10 has to pick ISO400. This causes noticeable quality difference for 1/25 sensor cameras.
SX110 is slightly smaller than its predecessor and DSCH10 making it easy to carry in front pocket of Jeans.</Content>

<Content>Was searching for a camera with an extended zoom and the resolution in the range of 8-10 MP. Caught hold of Canon SX 100 IS, but it vanished from the market before I could purchase it. Wanted a medium size camera so could not settle for Nikon P80/Canon S5 IS, because of its large size. Ordered Canon SX110 on the launch date itself with apprehensions about its features..but believe me, I am not dissapointed AT ALL.
Great manual controls for Aperture and Shutter speed make it a camera for Pros, while the Auto mode is wonderful for learning photographers. The zoom is great and the image stabilisation that the camera offers at the maximum zoom level (Even at 10x optical and 4x digital i.e 40x combined zoom) is awesome. The photos in low light during my recent trip to a hill station were good in the Night mode with lots of saturation of natural colours.
Face detection is also a good feature with the camera able to detect faces very very easily (I dont know how does it work, but it really works :-))
The Digital Zoom, unlike others cameras I have used, does not distort the image to a very large extent, thanks to the high resolution and the safety zoom features. I can upload photos to depict this.(I dont know how to do this in Amazon :-))
The battery life seemed ok only , as I was able to shoot around 200 shots with my Sony NiMH(2500mAH) bateries with flash. But the batteries are brand new and should gain more strength with a couple of charge-discharge cycles. But a spare set of batteries is always helpful.
I had a Nikon 5600 prior to this so wanted a middle size camera with extended zoom and manual controls, and glad to find SX 110 fit all my needs.
A thing that is missing is a Sports mode, which is a feature to shoot fast moving objects. I had this in my Nikon 5600, but could not yet find it on my SX110. Possibly the Manual controls for Aperture and Shutters could make this up for me. Still in the learning phase :-)</Content>

<Content>This is a new purchase, but Ive been putting it through its paces. It takes nice, in focus pictures, and the image stabilization is useful in avoiding flash shots, which need some color adjustment. It snaps much quicker than my old Lumix TZ7, and the large display is very nice, although a little difficult to see in bright sunlight. I miss the articulated screen that I had on my old S1 IS, but wasnt ready to spring for the S5 IS. For macro pictures I learned that I cannot zoom in if I also want an in focus picture. The scene options are useful, and I expect I will be using the Kids/pets option often. I took a serviceable video practically in the dark, and was pleased with the result. The long(ish)zoom is useful in a very portable size camera.</Content>

<Content>After doing all the research, I just knew this was the camera for me.   My main camera is a Canon Rebel and I was looking for a backup camera to use when I dont feel like carrying the big one around.  When I read the specs and reviews for this one, I rushed out to get it.

Problems:
Focusing is iffy.   Of the 15 pictures I shot, about 6 were out of focus.  Ive never had that problem with any other camera.  The macro function didnt focus at all.

Battery life is non-existent.  I shot about 15 pictures yesterday, picked up the camera today to take a quick snapshot and the batteries are totally dead.

The zoom makes it a great camera for kids sports pictures, but the delay makes it difficult to get any decent snapshots.   I admit, Im spoiled with the SLR, but at my sons flag football game yesterday, I could, at best, get off one shot per play.  

If you take just basic, posed, every body say cheese snap shots, then the quality of the pictures is great and the camera is easy to use.   Beyond that, I just find it frustrating.</Content>

<Content>Out of the box impressions are excellent.  Skipped the manual and wanted to see how it did in Auto.  If you owned an SX100 or read the reviews this camera fixes any cons that were written.  The LCD is very bright and no issues in the sun.  One other item of quick notice is the digital zoom which is normally a gimmick is pretty impressive.  At full optical zoom and 4x digital images are still sharp when using the super fine and 9MP settings.  Gonna read the book and start playing with all the features.  If I find a time lapse feature I am set.  I would say this camera is about the best you can buy for a point and shoot before entering into the SLR like and true SLRs.

<Content>This G10 works perfectly for the amateur or advanced photographer.  It is just simple enough to set at automatic for a beginner who wants quality photographs while on vacation or a special event.  However, if someone wants to get more advanced or just start experimenting in the manual mode, this camera will do just that without getting the amateur in trouble.  The pro photographer would do well with this camera as a nice back up to their SLR.  Personally, this writer is happy with his purchase.  It was a bit on the expensive side but the construction, design and functionality reflect it.</Content>

The only thing this camera gives up to my SLR is in the frames per second category, which means that for sporting events and wildlife in motion the Rebel still wins out...for all the rest I will take the G10.</Content>

<Content>Im not a camera critic, expert, or professional, and I get a little lost with the tech-speak in a lot of these reviews.  What I am is a mom of toddler twins who wants to capture the best (and the most) pictures of my kids that I can, with the least effort. I most recently had the Canon G5 and loved it - the G10 is definitely a step up in picture quality and convenience, though without some of the features I loved in the G5.  The g10 doesnt have the swivel LCD, which I took for granted in the G5 and miss now - it makes it a little more difficult to frame pictures of children because you have to bend down to review the shot in the viewfinder/LCD.  

Before settling on the G10, I tried the SX10 IS, and found it both bulky and complicated.  The G10 is small enough that it will easily travel in my purse, stroller, or jacket pocket - which means I wont be caught without it when those unpredictable Kodak moments arise.  

I have been very pleased with the photos I am able to capture of my children with this camera.  I have used the Auto, Portrait, and Kids  Pets settings and have gotten beautiful photos each way.  I have yet to experiment with the myriad other automatic and manual settings that this camera offers, but for what I need it to do most - capture my children and family - it excels.  </Content>

<Content>Its a great point and shoot , but its limitations for the advanced photographer are apparent. Increasing pixels on a small censor doesnt always help image quality, and at higher ISOs it is a negative factor due to the increase in noise. I found images made with ISOs over 100 unacceptable. The other problem with the small sensor is that depth of field remains very large, even with a wide aperture, so selective focusing is a problem. (Canon, PLEASE come out with a similar camera with a larger sensor..there IS a market out here for one.)

That said, it is wonderful as a point and shoot camera. The ergonomics are good. It is great as a little video camera. It has all the manual controls one needs. I put an old Leitz 28mm viewfinder in the hotshoe (the built in viewfinder is so far off, it is useless) which is nice for street photography...that is as long as its a bright, sunny day.

<Content>Pros: Very sharp images and low noise at ISO 200; RAW + JPEG files; optical viewfinder; decent wide-angle range; not too small for hands, pocketable in a pinch; a good backup to a DSLR.  NOTE: I process RAW files using DXO software, which corrects for lens distortions -- a nice combination.

Cons: Typical point  shoot shutter lag - not for action shots; short focal length lens makes it difficult to use selective depth of field even at f/2.8; telephoto position could be a little longer; exposure compensation dial moves too easily. </Content>

<Content>Ive been a recent subscriber to the great Canon G10 vs Panasonic LX3 debate. This is a decision youre going to have to face if youre looking for the top point and shoot. I read a million reviews and still could not decided. The Web is great, but the Web is diverse!  I decided I had to handle both cameras. That was important to me. The Canon G10 feels great. It has enough weight so it feels secure in your hand. The LX3 has that itty bitty shooter feel that 99 percent of all compacts have. Its a little longer than most compacts, but its still quite light and delicate feeling. I prefer the g10s feel, by far. I also loved the controls on the G10. I think if you want to mess around with exposure, aperture and speeds, theres no contest. The layout of the G10 takes it.  I love the spinning thumb wheel for scrolling through speed. For me, the least amount of electronic menus you have to navigate, the better. Now, Ive looked at hundreds of comparison shots and Im STILL undecided. The best of LX3 shots are just phenomenal - smooth and creamy -- but looking deeper into their history, theyre usually taken by pros with off-camera strobes and the best setups.  Ive likewise seen many of your average Joe shots taken with the LX3 that look, well, very average. Im not even impressed with some of the samples taken by a pro at the Panasonic website. But its practically the same story with the G10. Ive seen great and Ive seen blah.... But there is something more dynamic about the LX3 photos when theyre good ones. And I respond to that artistry deeply.  I found a website comparing the dynamic range of the two cameras and the LX3 beats the G10, which I think explains their differences.  So this is one of the hardest camera choices Ive ever had to make, There IS NO SIMPLE ANSWER! I think if I lived in a perfect world where I could play Cartier Bresson all day Id take the Panasonic. But for carrying around to take snapshots, family pics, graduations, Id have to go with the Canon just for the telephoto lens (and not an extravagant one at that). I used to shoot 35mm and, frankly, the 60mm zoom on the LX3 is no zoom at all. Im mean, the standard lens on cameras were 50mm or 52mm. Thats a 1:1 ratio. So a 60mm is basically nothing - youre just going from wide angle to normal. No zoom. Again, this is really a tough call. But one thing swaying me toward the G10 is practicality in real world situations. I found a website that describes how the G10 was a popular choice on a recent Antarctic exploration and that they bore up well under that climate. I probably wont get that extreme with mine, but if I were forced to hold both cameras and drop one (under gunpoint, that would have to be!) Id drop the G10 and feel better about it. The LX3 is nicely made, but it looked and felt fragile to me. It actually felt more fragile than my daughters Canon 770 point and shoot which is smaller, but a block of metal that seems to weigh the same. If the LX3 had felt like that, I wouldnt have worried so much about durability.  I also think light aluminum is more liable to damage than the G10s magnesium alloy. So real world vs perfect world. The wealthy artist in me says get the LX3 and live the life of light and perfect ---  the family man with a tendency to bump things says the G10 and you probably wont break it.... I guess I should just reckon with who I really am.... and get the G10.  Anyway, I hope my impressions help someone else.</Content>

<Content>As a professional photographer, I wanted a small camera to carry for personal work.  I wanted all the flexability of a pro camera in a small package. The G10 delivers most of it.  The 14+ megapixel sensor is more than enough and the RAW files are huge. I like that many of the controls are knobs on top of the camera but less pleased with the ones that are found under various menus. While much of the operation is intuitive, some features bear study of the manual (I dont like reading manuals).  
The only real gripe I have is the shutter lag. For an almost $500 camera I would have expected a much faster response. It is somewhat better than many small cameras but too slow for capturing the moment with a busy child or the action of a party.  I admit I am spoiled by the quick response of my Canon 20D and 5D.  I like the optical viewfinder, missing on so many small cameras.  I dont like the position of the zoom control under the shutter release.  Overall, I enjoy using it and Im impressed by the quality of the images it produces.</Content>

<Content>I have owned the G10 for many many months now.  I purchased it within a few weeks of its release, and after some hands on at the local Ritz Camera shop.  I also researched this camera extensively on the internet.  I made direct comparisons to its Nikon (P6000) and Lumix (Panasonic DMC FX-150) competetors.  In addition, I have the following accessories.  Wide angle lens, 2X telephoto lens, converter tube, several macro and filter sets, and the Magic Lantern G10 help book.  I have also ordered the new Speedlite 270ex flash, but have not received it yet.  My picture counter reads just under a thousand exposures.

When I first received my G10, I was very pleased.  As I had already put my hands on the camera, I was not suprized by its heft.  This camera is larger than the typical point and shoot, and thus a bit heavier.  You can not comfortably put this camera in your shirt or back pocket.  It will fit in a cargo pants side pocket.  It is still portable with a belt case or in a purse without much hassle.  

The build quality is expectional, and even though larger, very comfortable to hold (even one handed).  I wear a mans medium sized glove for comparison.  In my opinion, its size and heft actually help with holding the unit still.  When using the converter tube and the additional lenses, you can put your left hand under the barrell just like an SLR for additional support.

This camera is a photo enthusiasts dream.  When I first opened the package, I was so excited, I had to start taking pictures immediately and without reading the manual.  I left the camera to completely automated settings and snapped at anything that moved or had color.  After about a hundred (particularly useless) photos, I realized that this camera takes absolutley gorgeous pictures even on its auto setting.  Colors are amazing and detail is tight.  I experienced no problems with white balance, focus/blur, or noise.  I was very pleased, as my wife has no interest in ISO and can care less about apeture, so as a point and shoot, she will be able to use this camera with wonderful results.

The manual is very detailed, but like all manuals, difficult to read.  So I purchased the Magic Lantern G10 guide.  This is an excellent resource and is when my G10 truly started to shine.  Knowing not just how this camera does things, but why, has let me begin to use the G10 to a much fuller extent.  I mostly shoot in the more manual modes now.  The G10 has a complete full range of settings to allow an exceptional amount of creativity.  And the image quality is stunning.  As with most photography, I try to stay in that magic ISO range of 80 (the G10s lowest setting) to 400.  In regular light with good composition, I get fantastic clean pictures.  I have gone higher in the ISO with some small grains of noise.  But lets face it, if there was never a problem with noise, cameras would not have an ISO setting.  I hate it when people review (any) camera and complain about noise when it really is their own composition in question.  Saying that, this camera does do well in lower light situations.  

The features of image stabilization and a hearty 5X zoom with a 14.7mp sensor put this camera in top specs.  The LCD screen (920k) is really nice and the controls are all easy to manipulate and of quality build.  A great feature is the ability to take RAW images.  I recently got photoshop elements (version 7) as a present, and have had great fun.  Which is really what this hobby is all about.

The G10 was a great purchase.  A quality camera with lots of features and creative room.  Fast auto focus, high image quality, excellent processing from the digic 4 chip, image stabilization, and canon glass all have made me very very happy with it.  

So after all this glowering review, what are my quibbles?  Just a couple really.  First, the longest exposure allowed is 15 seconds.  While 99.9% of exposures are fractions of a single second, I would like to have a 30 second shutter for some longer blur pictures or moon shots. Second, when using the converter, you have to turn off your AF lamp as the extending tube slightly blocks the lamps beam, and skews your autofocus.  (No problems if your not using the extender tube and additional add on lenses). Lastly, the flash takes about 3-4 seconds for a recharge.  If the flash is charging, the camera will not fire, and you might miss a shot.  I would love to see the camera automatically flip to a higher ISO and still take the picture without the flash rather than miss or make me wait.  However, I do not know of any camera that does this, or if it is even technologically possible.  Then again, thats why the G10 has a fully functional hot shoe, and I have ordered the new Speedlite 270ex flashgun. 

So minor quibbles aside, this camera deserves to be Canons compact king.  An amazing camera that I can whole heartedly recommend.

Thank you for reading my review.

<Content>I bought this G10 a couple weeks ago and have been very happy with it. 

Its not a fast action or a big zoom camera, but if you know the limitations of the G10, it can produce awesome images. Ive been shooting landscape, animal, vegetation and macro shots and have been more than happy with the photos. 

The body feels high quality, and controls are nicely arranged. I use the LCD screen most of the time which displays clear bright images. Battery life has been very good for me...no complaints. I recommend buying a second battery for weekend or lengthy shoots.

Ultimately my plan is to use this for my high quality compact camera and buy a DSLR in the near future.

<Content>Man, I really had high hopes for the G10 having owned the earlier G3 Model which was awesome and is about to become a collectors item.  I thought, How much better can it be to own a model thats 7 more generations down the road?!  I purchased it in spite of the inordinate number of Amazon buyers who gave it 3-stars or below.  I thought it was probably user error or buyers remorse.  After about 300 trial photos, alas, I have to be honest to both myself and you  join the 3-star raters.

An awesomely built camera, the G10 will appeal to most of us who have been using high-end DSLRs and are looking for the flexiblity in features and the high portability of the G10...and to skilled prosumers who just really like the feel quality in their hands.

I have to say, I love the controls, the feel of the camera, the flexibility to fine tune and experiment in lots of different lighting and contrast situations.  But the G10 is unforgiving in both the auto mode and the manual modes if you dont get it just right.  Using it in auto mode, I rarely get a photo that is very satisfactory to my eye  taste.  They almost always have that soft, milky, overexposed look...kind of like taking a photo through atomospheric haze.

Now some better news!  If you are like me and you like your photos sharp, well-saturated, with lots of contrast, there is a solution.  Its in the mode called My Colors.  All you have to do is use the Program Mode, press the Func Section key in the middle of the control wheel,  curser down to Custom Color press the Disp. Button and  chose My Colors on the selector wheel.  Watch the choices at the bottom of the screen and you will find you can set the Sharpness, contrast,  color to your taste.  You can even tweak it to emphasize individual color like red, blue,  green while toning others down.  After cranking all of these settings to suit my taste and shooting in the Program Mode, I now find that my G10 is very close to what I was wanting in the first place.  I now get the sharpness, saturation, and contrast I love in my photos.

I guess the bottom line is that the default settings on the G10 are very much set to record life as we see it; but most of us want our photos to make life pop a little more than what we see in real life.  In other words, we like life a little more vivid in photos than it really is.  That makes them more fun and more pleasing to look at.  Looking at most of my G10 photos on the default settings reminds me of looking at the Grand Canyon through the haze of a distant forest fire.....beautiful but uninspiring and left wanting.

For build and quality, Ill give my G10 a 5-star; for quality of photo in the default modes, I have to downgrade it to 3-stars.  I think the Canon image crafters blew it on this one.  There just shouldnt be that much distance between what you get at the the default settings of the camera and the distance you have to go with the manual tweaks to get great images.

But Im keeping it.  Its got more pluses than minuses! </Content>

<Content>The camera is a mid-range camera that gives you a taste of the DSLR while excelling at the point-and-click.  The images are crisp and the auto functions for exposure and speed provide great high speed and low light images.  The last star would be if I could get the continuous shot to be faster (I was at an Air Show and the Blue Angels moved a little too fast!).  I may be asking for a little too much as again, it gives a taste of DSLR.</Content>

<Content>This camera rocks.  Dont worry about the high-ISO problems... no big deal.  This is the first digital camera Ive owned.  I was hesitant to give up the feel of my Olympus 0M cameras, but Im finally tired of paying for film-processing (esp. black and whites!... about[..] a pop now)

After searching online forever, I settled on the G10.  Ive had it for about a week.  If, like me, you love the feel of your film-style dials, you will LOVE the layout of the G10.  Canon really got the ergonomics right on this one.  The aperture and f-stop controls remind me of my old gear... (on the LCD screen, you can scroll through your shutter speeds, etc.) this has made my digital transition easy and fun.  Ive played around with my wifes digital cameras... but they never had that analog feel to them.  You can almost envision a roll of film inside of the solid G10.

I know that RAW is all the rage, but even the JPGs look great from this camera.  And yes, Ive shot it at high ISOs... and yes, there is noise, but like other(positive)reviews have said, it reminds me of film grain... doesnt bother me at all.  Try to stay under 800 if you can... if not, oh well... youll have some graininess to your image.

The G10 is the digital camera that film-lovers will fall in love with.  Is it as versatile as a DSLR?  No.  Personally, Id rather have an awesome camera thats easy to bring along than another SLR with a bag full of expensive lenses.  Even with my film SLRs, I always ended up bringing along just one lens... too much of a hassle to lug the whole kit around.

<Content>Had my G10 a few weeks now, my first serious digital purchase after 20 years on a Nikon F2. I didnt get a digi SLR because the best camera is the one you have with you and I am fed up with missing great pictures because I didnt bring the bulky SLR

Yes its noisy above 200 and you need to tweak sharpness in Aperture or similar post shot. Its a great camera though, well worth the money and with a great retro look and solid build. Dont think the viewfinder was necessary though as it is not accurate as to what you are really framing and using screen makes you choose different angles which is a good thing</Content>

<Content>I needed to have a good camera as a backup to an SLR and something I could shoot the occasional video with. This is a go everywhere camera for me that allows for many more shooting opportunities than my SLR. After quite a bit of research I selected the G10. In the few weeks that I have had it I have shot about 3.5k pictures and about 50 short videos. The results are fantastic. The colors a vibrant, the sharpness is great, the flexibility (for me) in the small size makes for some new shooting angles which is quite fun. 

Of note, this camera for me, is not suitable for fast action shooting, it requires a bit of planning to capture good quality shots because of a small shutter lag. Once I got used to the lag I was able to capture some quality action shots but it is more of a hit and miss affair for me than an actual repeatable occurrence.

I am really pleased with my choice and use it every day.</Content>

<Content>This camera has all the benefits of a point-and-shoot and many of the functions you expect from an SLR. I took it on an extended trip for its/my test run and used it in a multitude of conditions. Its a bit heavier than most p-and-s cameras but the improved features for manual operation are handsome and laid out more like a film camera. They make sense and feel good. 
Canons great lenses have never disappointed me. I got beautiful pictures in daylight conditions and was especially impressed by the macro shots. In low light, auto focus is somewhat compromised and there is still a fair amount of noise (though certainly less than previous Canon point-and-shoots, i.e.Canon PowerShot SD950IS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 3.7x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Titanium))The lag time associated with all p-and-s cameras is a factor with the G10 as well. Its minimal but it really counts when youre taking pictures of a moving target.
I still dont feel I can leave my SLR at home but this camera is a good attempt to close in on a more portable fun camera for perfectionists.</Content>

<Content>Though there are limits to this camera they are not in any way shot stoppers for most photographers. A little wide angle chromatic aberration - easily fixed in post, some sensor overload (blue halo) if used in blown out contrasty situations, and poor noise performance at mid/high ISOs. The last you know about, the first two you may expect. Thats it. After that its all just good to great. Very useful and smart electronic features, great body design with an extremely solid quality feel, well thought out ergonomics, a BIG bright screen, and a really sharp lens that captures more than enough to make me go wow! It is my new Leica CL so to speak, and a very welcome replacement at that. RAW is great and the JPGs are too. A fifteen dollar eight gig card stores about 350 of one of each. Fun shooting is fun again.
Perfect? No, but for the money spent vs. quality obtained close enough.</Content>

<Content>My wife and I bought this camera looking for better image quality than a supercompact digital can provide, but not wanting to spend DSLR prices. We also wanted something somewhat compact. We couldnt be happier. Great images, easy to use. The dial controls on the top remind me of my old Nikons. Feels well made and buttons all seem to be where youd want them.

Very little shutter lag- already getting good shots of my really fast kids- and good image stabilization. Great photos- very sharp and well exposed.

Built in flash is very good, BUT I LOVE (!) THE HOTSHOE... I can use my old Metz flash to get a little distance. You would need to use a Canon digital-specific flash to use in automatic modes, but Im an old manual shooter anyway.
Highly recommended if your situation is like ours... Just love this camera.</Content>

<Content>The great part: This is one teriffic point and shoot!
The frustration(s): This camera can do everything a pro shooter could want in a compact digital BUT..
1. Confusing nested menu structure to get to manual control of everything.
2. Every time I turn the main control dial it resets things that I dont want to reset.
3. Manual focus is really difficult in an LCD display.
4. I have no control (that I know of) for the internal flash power.
5. I really wanted a viewfinder camera. This is a camera with an afterthought of a viewfinder. It provides no information such as shutter speed or f stop selected rendering it useless. You must do all of the set-up with the LCD and then if you desire you can sort of frame the picture with the viewfinder but why bother?
6. Dont expect that just because it has 14.7 MP imager that it will make pictures like a Nikon D3 or even a D-70. This little imager adds a lot of noise into the image even when you dial the sensitivity down to 200 ISO. 
7. The LCD display shows everything the camera is doing to the point of complete distraction. It is so filled up with text and odd shaped icons that I can barely find the image I am photographing.


OK I have been pretty tough on this little camera but only because I almost expected it to act like a Leica M8. It does not and it is not fair of me to compare it to that class of camera.  That said I carry it everywhere with me and it may be the best point and shoot digital I have ever owned. I only hope the next generation G camera will have more intuitive controls to mimick a 35MM RF camera and (best of all) I hope it has a rangefinder.</Content>

The menus and dials are nicely designed. I dont feel like I will out-grow this camera and think its durability will last for many years to come.</Content>

<Content>The Canon G10 suits my needs perfectly.  I wanted a camera that gave me more manual options for creative control over my photos.  Having been familiar with the workings of the Powershot series, making the transition to this advanced digital compact was relatively easy.  The wide angle is wide enough for my needs and I especially like the macro mode which gets very, very close and produces spectacular images.  Ill try to send out a macro image I took of my small indoor cactus.

Im very happy with my purchase and look forward to playing around with the many optional controls and settings.</Content>

<Content>I have used for years my Canon Rebel Digital, but needed an alternative camera to carry for quick trips in which I did not want to carry my big camera case. I still wanted to be able to have full control of the parameters but at the same time allow my wife and children to use it and not have to know all the details. I did my research and found this camera. I have not been dissapointed. Its zoom gives you the equivalent of wide angle up to about 130 mm and you have all the versatility of your bigger SLR with aperture, time and manual controls if desired. It takes also quick and nice digital video clips which, after buying a large memory card, Im able to take large video clips if necessary. 
I suggest this camera exactly for the amateur photographer who already owns a larger camera but needs a smaller one for certain events. I do not recommend this camera to the first-time digital camera buyer, as probably it will have more whistles than you desire.</Content>

1. Images are too soft. It did not matter what I did, tweaking it to the max, the G10 produces worse images than my old Canon A620. There is fair amount of noise too at any ISO speed.
2. Shot to shot time is too long. I can probably live with this, but again, I am not happy with the images.

Received camera much later than when I ordered. Not a problem wasnt in  hurry anyway. Once in hand camera seemed very solid. I had read all the reviews from amazon and elsewhere, and even considered getting the Nikon P6000 in its stead. Two issues arose immediately. First, was a light banding issue in the LCD. Whenever I pointed the camera in the direction of a light source (ie. a energy saving light bulb hanging from the ceiling and its reflection in a mirror) perfect solid bands of light would streak across the LCD screen emanating from the lights. I contacted Canon and they seemed baffled by this. They suggested that it might have been firmly jostled during shipping and affected the processor. If I sent it to them I was looking at a two week turn around, or I could just send it back to the shipper as defective, which I ultimately did. The Second issue was an error message regarding its ability to write to the card. The actual wording of this message escapes me but I did bring it up with Canon at the time called. He was not sure what was wrong either, but did suggest the memory card could be bad. It was a 16gb PQI SDHC card class 6. It in fact was a defective card and I have since received another PQI 16gb card and that issue was solved. So in conclusion the camera was returned and another was sent out.    .....TO BE CONTINUED 

(Purchased on 01/16/2009)
...APPARENTLY I can only post once even though I was sent three reviews. 
I received a another G10 because the first was defective. When I pointed at a source of light (ie. energy saving bulb) a solid band of light emanating from the source would stretch across the LCD screen. The other issue was solved by exchanging a defective 16gb card. Now, this new camera had the same light banding issue, and this time it also had a few dead pixels on the LCD. I could not believe my luck. The dead pixels was a no brainer this camera was going back too. However, in all the reviews I had read, I had not come across one regarding the light banding issue. So, I sent this camera back. I did replace the order. I have since received yet another G10. It writes fine to the SD card, in fact I also purchased another 16gb and now have a PQI and a Transcend. I had also purchased two extra batteries for this camera, so I was committed to make this work. As a side note, each 16gb card can take up to 2450 shots on superfine mode @ 15MP, 3984 @ 9M, 6126 @ 5M, 9999 @ 2M and web size, 3267 @ WS, and 756 using RAW.
If you set RAW+JPG you only get 636, this is the setting I use mostly. So with three batteries I am supposedly good for up to 1200 shots. Cant comment on video, because I have not really delved into it.

(Purchased on 02/02/2009)
Finally, received my third attempt at purchasing this camera. As I said before I am committed to making this work. Review after review insists that this camera is unparalleled in its class, and I am a Nikon leaning personality. Anywho, my third attempt. Camera in hand. LCD screen is perfect. No issues with either memory card. I point towards a light source, stare at the LCD. Light banding issue? YES. as it turns out it happens no matter what type of light I point to. Although it shows in the LCD it does not translate to the actual pic. So, LCD- yes, photo- no. Overall the camera seems to be a very decent choice. I bought it to take pictures you might take with a good DSLR but not have to carry one. Something to fit in the pocket. I am barely a photo enthusiast, but like to have quality and the ability to achieve more than my initial intentions. Who knows, might actually take this more seriously in the future as a hobby. Most of the shots I have taken are marco, and I have to say I am impressed. I do not regret the choice, for the most part I am satisfied with the G10, but I am curious in knowing if I could have saved a little more by going with the Nikon P6000, and achieved relatively similar results.

I rated this camera as three stars for the overall experience. The camera itself is more like Four Stars. If not for the light banding issue, I would have given it Five.

<Content>I have been playing with technical photography for many years. That is just another way of saying that I have no ability to capture interesting and artistic images naturally but that I can occasionally produce something cool because I understand the science. Since the advent of digital cameras, Ive been playing with them (starting with a 1.2m Olympus) and finally sold off the remaining film gear around 2000, making the full transition to digital. Unfortunately, until now, I havent found the ideal digital camera.

The Canon G10 just might be that perfect little camera, at least for me. Controls, form-factor, resolution, overall image quality... all add up to make a very capable and high quality instrument. The joy of being able to do a long exposure night shot and get immediate gratification by reviewing the image is unmeasurable. Amazing my kids with flashlight painted shots and time-lapse is cool. Having video on-hand is tremendous. Of course, shooting touristy snap-shots and capturing in RAW to enable that 2-stop correction magic is a given. Easily placed controls and menu-less access to most functions make daily use quick and rewarding. No more squinting at menus to try and set shutter priority or ISO, just press the button and turn the knob.

My G10 replaced a bulky Canon D400 (Rebel XTi) that I typically carried around with a 28-135 zoom on it. I travel extensively and found that carrying the D400 was just too much trouble. While the D400 is an awesome camera with similar features (lower resolution and no video capability), its bulk and traditional compact SLR form-factor were too much for me. The SLR, through the lens shooting method is compensated for on the G10 by a decent and reasonably accurate range-finder though I have found the large LCD to be more useful for framing and even quick shooting.

If what you are looking for is an all around point-and-shoot, this might not be it. The G10 is targeted to a different market segment. If you are looking for that one camera to own if you understand photography, enjoy pushing the limits and having a little extra capability and you dont want to jump into a full SLR configuration, this is the camera for you.

The build quality is excellent, it has a beautiful design and the ergonomics are great. The EV wheel on top of the camera is very useful. The improved grip and bigger LCD screen are very nice additions when compared to the G7.

The RAW capability is nice when taking pictures indoors or when shooting landscapes, but I prefer Jpegs when shooting street photography. The Jpeg conversion is very good, and the photos come out great with the in-camera processing. 

The E-TTL metering works very well. The photos always come out correctly exposed. It also works great with the 430EXII and 580 EXII flashguns when shooting indoors.

The lens is improved, and is nice and sharp across the range. The edge sharpness is also improved compared to the G7.

The shots up to ISO 400 look great on prints up to A4. Small prints are very usable at ISO 800, but wouldnt print at A4 without noise reduction( I use Dfine 2 for this purpose). At base ISO you can print at A2 and get great results.

There are some minor drawbacks, though:

- The shutter is placed right on top of the camera. It would be more confortable to have it on top of the grip, in a slight angle( like on a DSLR). 

- The zoom joystick is placed on the shutter. I would prefer it on the back( where the thumb rest when holding the camera). This way I dont need to take my index finger off the shutter when zooming.

- The optical viewfinder, although better than the one on the G7, still suffers from parallax error, and is way too small.

-  The movie mode doesnt support HD recording. It should be possible to record in 720p with this camera.

- Noise at high ISO( 800 and 1600) is very high. Iso 1600 shouldnt be used except when really desperate. ISO 800, as stated above, is fine for small prints, and up to A4 with NR)

- The tripod mount is not centered with the lens. 

Compared to the LX3: The G10 holds its own in most departments; has better ergonomics and build quality. The IQ is equal to the LX3. Noise levels at same image size is equal. In low light the LX3 is better thanks to the faster lens( you can shoot with the LX3 at 1 stop lower ISO, which translates into less noise). The LX3 lens is wider( great for indoors and landscapes), but shorter( stops at 60mm, while the G10 reaches 140mm tele). its hard to pick out a winner. The LX3 is better for indoors and low light, and is wider which is great for street and landscapes, but the G10 is better built and has a more versatile lens, which makes it a better allround and travel camera. </Content>

<Content>Have only owned the camera a brief while, however, overall Im satisfied.  The camera is a blast to use.  The knobs offer quick access for frequently used settings without endless button pushing and menu drilling.  The form factor is great.  Others have complained about the weight and size, however, I love it.  It gives the camera a nice sturdy feel in my hand.  Best of all, I wanted DSLR performance in something that I would be willing to lug around an amusement park all day.  This fits the bill just fine.  Is it an Elph? No, but if you want a subcompact ps, go buy one.  This is geared more towards people who want advanced features in a reasonable size, without going fully DSLR.  The rear LCD is razor sharp.  Focusing is fast and acurate.  I havent experienced any missed shots due to focusing issues.  I read complaints of poor low light performance, however I got excellent results shooting low light.  I might post some samples later.  And normal lighting shots are amazing.  Details are sharp, colors nice and crisp, and contrast is perfect.  My only complaints are with the unnecessary pixel increase and lack of zoom. I also had a dead pixel on my first G10.  From my understanding, the dead pixel issue is more common than I am comfortable with.  At 14mp, the shots can look a little noisy when displayed at full resolution.  Its a good size for editing, but I may jack the resolution down to a less noisy size.

05/03/09 Update:
Well, I returned the G10. The shots were good, however I felt the amount of noise was simply unacceptable for a high-end point and shoot of this caliber.  I eventually purchased a Canon SD880 Elph instead (I know... Im laughing myself at the irony of my statement above and subsequent purchase of an Elph).  However, the biggest surprise is that the image quality of the Elph seems much better than the G10.  At full resolution, there is significantly less noise in shots taken with the SD880.  I really wanted to like/keep the G10, and believe me, I tried everything to compensate for the noise.  But in the end, image quality is the most important factor of a digicam; and the G10 just doesnt cut it as the supposed flagship of the Canon PS line, especially for the price. I cant change my star rating, however, I would likely give the G10 2-3 stars highest, and thats only for the wide array of features.</Content>

<Content>I was very happy with my G9 but because it was accidentally dropped and unusable I purchased a G10 a month ago. I havent made any large prints as yet (17x12) but  the quality of 8x10 prints is outstanding. I shoot in raw, and did have trouble getting the camera to communicate wih Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop,because I am definitely not a nerd, so I spent a few anxious hours until I got it right.The transition between the two cameras is not exactly seamless. The batteries are not compatible, and I liked the G9s longer lens.I own a DlSR, but I find the Canon Powershot Pro series is great for my kind of work.</Content>

<Content>I bought the G10 last fall when it first came out after lengthy and agonizing research had narrowed the field to two cameras: The G10, and the Panasonic LX3. The requirements were: RAW files, wide angle lens, fast response (after my S70, anything would look fast, though). And of course excellent image quality. I bought the G10 because, well, Im a Canon guy, and it had a larger zoom range and an optical viewfinder, even though the lens barely squeaks by as wide.

After five months of owning the G10, I sold it last week and ordered a Panasonic LX3 the same day. Im not sure how the LX3 is going to to work out, but I had a love/hate relationship with the G10 from day one. I do a lot of outdoors stuff, mountaineering, skiing, kayaking, etc. The G10 is just too big and heavy for those situations, so I found myself dreading having to drag it along and so sometimes didnt. I would bet a considerable sum that if you take a G10 apart, youll find a lot of unnecessary metal, put there by the Canon marketing department to give the G10 a satisfying, Leica-like heft and density. Also, I like an optical viewfinder because it allows me to turn off the display and conserve battery power on multiday trips. But the optical viewfinder is just not usable - it is pitifully inaccurate, the lens protrudes in the frame, and there are no markings to help line things up (useful since the protruding lens has distorted your perception of angles and proportions).

I may be the only one on the planet to say this, but I think the G10 is an ergonomic disaster. Sure, its great to have those nice big metal dials on top, and it gives the camera a nice Leica look. And the menu system is just fine, no issues there. But thats only half the story. The back of the camera, under your thumb, is plastered with little protruding plastic resistanceless buttons, not to mention a slippery protruding plastic combination of control wheel and five control buttons about the size of my thumbnail. Im constantly hitting all those little buttons and sending it into manual focus, or turning off the display, or whatever. Ive even glued little plastic bumpers to the back to try and protect the little buttons (doesnt work). Manual exposure is an unbelievable nightmare of finding and pushing a tiny button to cycle through shutter speed/f-stop/meter mode (meter mode!!) and then use that slippery tiny little wheel to set the value - and dont accidentally click one of the five even tinier buttons inside the tiny wheel. Use with gloves? Forget it. If youve used a Canon 20D DSLR or better you know Canon understands ergonomics. Even my old Canon S70 is light-years ahead in ergonomics, if you ask me. So why did Canon do this to the G10?  I should have been prepared for this, I returned an S80 after two days for the very same control issues.

But the worst issue for me, the G10 produces the largest percentage of truly awful images of any camera Ive ever owned, and were going back to some pretty primitive film cameras here. Im not sure what the problem is, perhaps limited dynamic range due to the high pixel count, combined with a strong tendency towards overexposure, possibly my own laziness but its certainly not ignorance. I find I really have to work at not getting the blinking overexposure warnings on the playback images. If I wanted to work that hard, Id have brought my DSLR and gotten better images. And do not ignore the reports of others that noise is an issue even at relatively low ISOs - it definitely is a problem. I always shoot RAW, so dont think thats the solution.

The lens is sharp and reasonably free of distortion and fringing, although of limited usefulness at longer focal lengths due to its dimness. The RAW files can process out to some very nice images with either the included Digital Photo Professional or Photoshop CS4s Camera Raw. (Previous versions of Photoshop will never handle the RAW files, so you may need to upgade Photoshop for a couple of hundred bucks if you need that).

It is true the G10 is capable of stunning images in exactly the right conditions (plenty of low-contrast light) and I have quite a few. But thats not what you get capturing a sunrise on a mountaintop, and you dont get any images at all if you blow off taking the camera because its too heavy. Ive ended up thinking of the G10 as kind of like an old manual exposure 35mm camera loaded with Kodachrome 25. Big, heavy, awkward to use. Can make great, outstanding photos. Usually doesnt.

<Content>I love this camera, had it for about a month now and I must point out how easy it is to use. I love playing with the manual settings and find that canon makes this so simple and convenience. I had the Leica d-lux 3 before this and even thought the images were stunning it was always a few extra clicks and turns in the menu before i got to the settings i wanted. I would recommend this camera to anybody that enjoys shooting with an SLR but does not like to carry something heavy!

<Content>Hi everyone... I am a travel photographer and generally shoot Nikon SLRs; however, they have not caught up in image quality in this area (compacts p6000) yet.

I originally bought the LX-3 by panasonic withe the Leica 2.0-2.8 glass; and what they say is true, it is better in low-light. But mainly only because of its faster aperture; if you were to compare the two at ... say iso 400 at 5.6.. the g10 wins. I also didnt like the 35mm equiv of 24-60 on the lx-3, so I brought it back and got the G10.

The G10 is much more versatile with better controls and ergonomics. I didnt care for the lx-3 having a lens cap either!! The G10 also has exceptional image quality for a sensor of this size. Basically if you want the BEST all around compact get the G10; however, if you are really into landscapes and shooting with available light indoors then take a look at the lx-3.</Content>

<Content>The G10, as of today, has the best resolution of any point and shoot you can buy, better than most DSLRs, but only if it is used in ISO 80.  Raise the iso, and performance drops.

If you want to shoot a lot in low light, then get a large sensor DSLR or the latest Fuji.

I use the camera mostly for Underwater pictures, using strobes... and there, the combination of macro on demand, zoom macro (something not available with a dslr) and the 28 mm wide angle, make this the best camera I have ever used.

You also now get the same raw image software the high end cameras use...nice add on.</Content>

I received the camera a few days before a trip to the Pacific Northwest and tested it out at home to make sure I was comfortable with the new features...I was finally upgrading from the original G1!  The camera functioned well until the day fo the Father/Daughter dance when suddenly every shot looked like it was over-exposed!  I tried everything and took it to a local camera shop where I was told that the camera had a defective sensor.  I even called Canon and then i called Amazon and made arrangements for a replacement camera which happened without a hitch.  The camera functions flawlessly and the movie mode is better than I thought it would be.</Content>

However, due to its 28mm wide angle lens, it cannot be used underwater with a real wide angle lens neither allow to use wide angle lenses (15mm) in any usual underwater cases, including Canon WP-DC28.

So, if you want to use it take pictures underwater also, consider to have another one only for underwater that can be used with accessories.</Content>

<Content>Lets get something straight from the beginning.  I dont care if you spend $[...] or $[...] for a digital camera, none of them are perfect.  It is like the surfer roaming the world looking for the perfect wave, it just doesnt exist.  Some waves and some cameras are closer then others but none are perfect.  With that said, the G10 is closer.

I have been shooting digital for 10+ years.  That makes me a bit of a dinosaur.  I have been in love with photography and camera equipment for 50+ years.  I expect that in the next 10 years the technology will get better and the G10s successor will handle noise better then this model.  Until that happens, I will shoot at no higher then 400iso (in film days that was very fast) and use Nik Define 2.0 to get rid of the noise.

I was going to give the G10 a 4 but raised it to a 5 based on a comparison with other P+S cams rather then trying to compare it with a DSLR.  This camera is at the top of the heap of the P+S (along with 1 or 2 others).  If you are serious about photography and want a camera that is capable (capable is the operative word)in the right hands of someone who knows how to take a photograph (not a picture), the G10 is a great tool.

The lens is very sharp.  The resolution is excellent.  The colors are great.  I wont discuss the negatives.  They are obvious and apparent from other reviews.  I do know that if you accept the limitations of the this P+S cam and you learn to live with them and/or work around them, you will enjoy an excellent camera that does have the feel of the old film rangefinders.  To me that is the greatest appeal.  If Leica had this camera they would charge $[...].

<Content>Im an old film shooter.  When I decided to switch to digital I bought a Canon G6 in part because it had a good optical viewfinder and not the awful electronic viewfinder the Nikon had.

The first year I used the viewfinder only.  The second year I began to use the flipout LCD screen indoors.  The third year I used the LCD screen all the time indoors.

In October 2008 I bought a new G10 with a bigger LCD screen that does not flip out and, unfortunately, a worse optical viewfinder.  This one only covers 77% of the image the camera takes, less than the 80% coverage on my old G6.  Thats worse!  It also has a diopter control that is a black wheel with absolutely no markings on it to show where the middle value is, no way to know when the optical viewfinder is neutral.  The wheel has about 10 clicks from one extreme to the other, so if you dont see your shot clearly you click one or two this way, if you still dont see clearly you click three or four the other way...  Awful!  Better they left this feature off!

If this is your first digital camera, maybe not...

But if you already have a digital camera and you use only the LCD screen already and you want more pixels, a bigger LCD screen, etc then, maybe yes!</Content>

The color intensity will blow you away. At first i had a problem with it being so silent when the picture was taken that I kept checking  to see if the picture recorded. It takes a little maneuvering to hold the camera because of the left side being short. The weight of the camera is very light for such an intricate machine.</Content>

I considered buying a digital SLR but didnt want to deal with the size when on vacation. I purchased the G10 before my last vacation and I had a blast with it.

<Content>Construction/quality control: very disappointed! Both, the original new G10 that I bought straight from Amazon, AND its new replacement, had specs of white fuzz under the enclosed lens! Im guessing Canon is getting hit hard by the global financial crisis too and decided that clean rooms were over-rated! Sorry to sound so negative, but paying this much for the best, youd expect great quality control! Anyway, the first camera I received had a large piece of white dust easily visible to the unaided eye, though it happened to be on the outer edge of the focal area. It never seemed to be noticeable in average photos, but I would get an artifact from sun glaring photos that seemed to originate from that area of the lens, so to be safe, I returned it to get it replaced. The second unit had a much smaller piece of fuzz, but at this time I just needed a camera and gave up on the frustration of getting even another questionable unit. Last complaint is the eyepiece, even though I never use it, I was dismayed to find out how easily ambient dust finds its way into the eyepiece aperture. Even though we always keep the camera in a bag, it somehow gets dust under the eyepiece. Im guessing it sneaks in through the focusing dial? I frankly dont care since I doubt I will ever use the eyepiece, but hey, maybe this is bad news for some other people. I must say, putting all this aside, the body is solid, I like its feel! 

Features: Fast, I love how I almost dropped the camera when I first turned it on; the lens speed open so fast I lost my grip, then I grabbed the camera to get a better hold of it, then accidentally hit the camera button and took a photo, in what all seemed to be a millisecond... WOW that was fast! I also must say... more buttons is very good! This unit is awesome, since it has so many easy to get to buttons right on the device, less fishing through countless dialogs to get what you want. But now that Canon focused on making a camera with more buttons, one can still complain that their is still not enough! I could bore you with a list, but I just have to give them credit for such a nice camera. Probably my only complaint is that some modes dont save adjusted settings, like auto mode for instance... if you say no flash, but then switch to a manual mode, then come back, you lost your no flash setting. But oddly other settings are sometimes kept in the manual modes.... weird! This is where an additional button for using stored or default settings would be nice. LOL

Picture Quality: had trouble viewing canon RAW format in Linux. Some reason three different interpreters distorted the coloring and made the photos unusable. Maybe Canon changed their format since the G10, and Linux community hasnt kept up? Quality of photos, not too shabby, but like other people, I wish they would drop the megapixel race and focus on ISO quality! Megapixels are no match for lousy dark photo shots!

Video mode: the video camera... ugh, drives me crazy when you buy a camera only to find out optical zoom is turned off when in video mode. Funny, some cameras get bad reviews because the zoom motor makes noise in the microphone when people use it, so they complain about it. Canon must have taken note of this and decided to turn the feature off, but to those who complain about the noise, DONT USE THE ZOOM then, or just use digital zoom instead! Geesh, bad marketing scheme for Canon, VERY bad! Otherwise, camera is very good. I like how it seems that stabilization is linear rather than logarithmic. Some cameras stabilization is jerky and unnatural, and if you take off the stabilization, all you see is shake shake shake. This cameras stabilization is built in and is smooth. It has a VERY slight swing or rubber band effect to it, but a much more natural one! You probably wouldnt even notice it, but it helps greatly. You can still get a shake in the recording, but it is nothing like other cameras! VERY NICE!

Firmware: this is the first Canon I have ever owned, and I must say, I find the menu system has a very large learning curve to get used to it! I think once in a while companies should leave bad ideas and move to more useful ones, but I dont blame them for trying to adopt and maintain a menu standard to make it easier for previous Canon users. Good approach, but I dread to find out where they might place the next 20 features that come out in their next model, maybe another button? That would be nice! :)

Battery life: not too bad... as expected, one can always wish for more life, nothing new here!

<Content>Here is a no-nonsense review of an advanced POINT AND SHOOT.

Ive seen lots of back and forth arguments of good and bad and this and that. Canon states that this camera is for the advanced amateur. (Its usually the Pros that complain the most.) Its a very sexy looking camera that has a lot of cool features that can make some beautiful images if you have a good understanding of photography. It can go full automatic for those of you who dont (yet). The camera feels like quality, from weight (13 oz.) to the clicks of the knobs, to the smoothness of the lens movements. The battery lasts a good 400 shots if you dont do the on camera slide shows or forget to shut it off (it has power saving feature as well). If you ask me, its about as good as a $400 - $500 camera can get. The rest of this review is for the ones who are worried about the negative reviews still.

Its not going to stand up to a DSLR but it will give you very high quality vacation, wedding guest, birthday and family event type pictures. I am told you can get a very acceptable 11 X 14 print from it. I use it to find interesting locations for pro shoots and shutter bugging or if I just want to give my shoulder a rest from carrying around a DSLR. If you shoot a lot of night scenes, this camera may NOT be for you (there arent too many affordable DSLRs that cant pull this off either) you will see noise (red, green and blue colored digital grain). Heres why, in the simplest terms I can think of: Think of the sensor as a very smart solar panel (smart because it sees colors too). It generates electricity when light hits it  telling the brain of the camera that there is a certain amount of light intensity there. If there is no light, you get blackness, no electricity. If you try to force detail into an area of a picture that is absent of light, by using a long shutter time, you get noise. It could be a stray signal from the cameras system or other heavily scientific stuff going on to cause these dots. AND IF YOUR SHOOTING BELOW A 1/4 OF SECOND, EVEN WITH A HIGH ISO, YOU WILL GET SOME DEGREE OF NOISE. Its the nature of of the digital format. Use a flash.

Raw Format, although very impressive with its oops! correction abilities, will not save every image. It should not be used as a crutch or a cheat. It still needs to be exposed within a reasonable exposure latitude or in the ball park.

OK. Im down off my soap box. Great little camera. Bottom line. </Content>

<Content>I decided to take this while on vacation instead of my dSLR and lens.  It proved a worthy alternative.  I usually had the Canon on a wrist strap with lensmate hood or in Lowepro terracline 50 bag. Either way the camera was easily accessible for quick photos.
I mainly shot jpg+RAW and was pleased with the auto exposure.  I often used the exposure compensation on left dial and quickly was able to judge exposures using the LCD monitor while adjusting.  The multitude of shooting modes were not used except for the aquarium and night scenes.  These produced excellent results.
The main difference that I noted with the Canon G10 and my dSLR is that because it is lighter and because of its image stabilization, I was able to take handheld night scenes with the shutter down to 1/16 and even 1/8 second. 
Items that were more appreciated with use:  the large bright LCD monitor (I might even get used to using instead of a viewfinder), the histogram function, the wide angle lens, and being able to compensate exposure while shooting and seeing results!!</Content>

<Content>This camera performs very well considering the fact that it is a PS.  Ive read a lot of reviews about this camera before I purchased it.  Many were very critical of the fact that it doesnt act like an SLR.  But the fact of the matter is that it isnt an SLR.  I wanted a pocket camera that performed better than the average PS.  If I want SLR results, I will bite the bullet and bring the bulkier equipment.  But there are a lot of times I want something small that Im not as concerned about breaking.  Id be very upset if I damaged a lens or the body of my SLRs.  Last weekend, I went skiing with the family.  I wanted photos, but this was my first time on the slopes.  Taking an SLR wouldnt have been a smart choice.  Taking this PS was perfect.  I took a few movies and a bunch of nice snapshots.  I am very happy with the camera.  All that said, I gave this gadget a 4 instead of a 5 for a particular reason.  Canon apparently decided to move away from the Windows format movies for some reason.  So the movies are all Quicktime movies (*.MOV).  Since the majority of the population uses Windows based products, I find this highly aggravating.  I know that Apple is popular, but I would have prefered to see an option to use Quicktime or Windows Media Player options rather than moving completely away from the Windows environment.  I have Quicktime on my Windows systems.  So I can convert the movies manually, but that is a pain...and recently I noticed that Ive been loosing quality in the transfer.  So in this one small place, I am not pleased.  But it was still a good purchase.</Content>

<Content>What can I say that hasnt already been said about this remarkable camera? It is hands down the best point and shoot camera on the market today. I know many professional photographers that reach for this camera INSTEAD of the old professional standbys. Youd have to nit-pick to find something wrong with this camera. Canon did their homework well on the G10 and it looks like no doubt the up and coming G11 will be setting new standards. Lensmateonline has great adapters made specifically just for the G10. Without a doubt the G10 also has one of the best batteries that weve ever seen on a product like this, as it seems to last forever. If youre a professional, or just want the best point and shoot camera on the market, the Canon G10 will make you a happy camper! The video that this camera shoots is also quite remarkable. Google for the best price and you wont be sorry that you bought this camera. I take a LOT more pictures than I ever have before, and its all because of how well made this camera is, and how well it does everything.</Content>

<Content>I grew tired of dragging lenses around and a huge DSLR body.  I found myself carrying my camera less and less. I did a lot of research trying to find some simpler solution and became interested in the G-10.  I have used this camera for a couple months now and have taken 1000 photos.  With all of the things that people say it cant do (zoom in like a 400mm lens,etc.) this thing fits the bill for a camera you can carry everywhere. It is true that the best camera is the one you have with you.  I love this camera. Some have said it is heavy - if it wasnt heavy, they would say it is light and feels cheap. The G-10 feels excellent to me and the weight is fine to me.  It does feel solid and well built.  I use the camera exclusively on manual mode because I have a huge amount of creative leverage.  I have experimented a lot with night shots of buildings and cities from elevated areas of my town and have seen excellent results. I love it, I have it with me everywhere, the battery lasts a long time and did I mention I really like this camera?  I use an 8GB extreem III and I pack it around in a smallish camera case from National Geographic.  No, this is not a digital SLR.  It can be a point and shoot if you want, I have a tripod in my car and make time exposures at night and dusk, etc. Once you get the menu and interface down, youll be quick at setting up shots whenever you need to. And, if you need real speed, just flip to Auto mode and its ready.  Also, one last thing - Amazon.Com of course performed perfectly, too!</Content>

<Content>I have fairly extensive experience with digital cameras, usually changing cameras once or twice a year.  This CANON POWERSHOT G10 is near the top of the point-and-shoot list and it makes a great back-up camera for pros or pro-sumers. However, it  has some short-comings that may affect your decision to get this camera.  So, here is the breakdown:

PROS:
- MANUAL CONTROL, giving control of exposure and aperture settings.
- RAW FORMAT is supported which is highly recommended for post-editing your images on your computer with Photoshop CS4, for example.
- beautiful large screen is pleasure to review your shots.
- SMART BLACK DESIGN feels sturdy and has rubber gripping.
- 5X ZOOM is better than the standard 3X (included on most current point-and-shoots).
- ON-BOARD EDITING to crop or rotate your photos.
- RECHARGEABLE BATTERY AND DOCK INCLUDED. a better option than using alkaline and this battery last for a long time
- 14.7 MEGAPIXELS for large-sized prints

CONS:
- ODD PLACEMENT OF MANUAL CONTROLS. it would have been nice to have dedicated dials for the exposure and aperture, rather than the ISO speeds and compensation.
- BATTERY IS SQUARE, making it easy to put the battery in the wrong direction.
- BAD LOW LIGHT RESPONSIVENESS. low-light shots are only good if you are willing use are tripod or keep very still.
- LAG. as a premium camera, it bothers me that there is lag - meaning a long time from the moment you press the shutter button to the moment the picture is written to the card.
- CONTINUOUS SHOT MODE IS SLOW. you will miss a lot of moments if you want to capture action shots.
- VIDEO IS STANDARD QUALITY, but then again, this supposed to be a still camera, not a video camera

All in all, if you dont mind the slowness of the camera, having so much control is a welcome strength in the G10 as a point-and-shoot. But I say, spend the extra $200 or so and jump to an D-SLR, if you want REAL control.

<Content>I am a very enthusiastic new owner of a Canon Powershot G10. Its hands down one of the best high end compact cameras on the market today. I refrain from saying point  shoot, because to merely point and shoot with this camera is felonious.

Once you start to explore the multitude of tweaks that can be made to an image with the G10, you will never just point and shoot again.

I rarely even consider grabbing my DSLR, and that huge bag anymore. (6 lenses, 3x 580exII speedlites, cards, batteries, etc,.).

The G10 rivals DSLRs in tweakability, features, and image quality. That makes me feel comfortable in most cases leaving the house with just my G10

I am shooting more now, because of not being burdened with a body, lenses, and everything else an enthusiast or pro is liable to bring.

I only use my Canon 20D, 40D,  50D when I need faster focus, a brighter lens, or bulb for long exposures. Most times my G10 can handle whatever I throw at it. I use them to look more professional for paid work and alot of those jobs could be adequately done with my G10, wireless st-e2 transmitter, and a couple of speelites.

The Canon PowerShot G10 upgrades (vs the G9) include a sensor boost of 15MP versus 12MP, the new Canons DIGIC 4 image processor, a wider 28mm optical image stabilized zoom lens and RAW mode.

The G10 has a 6X zoom (28-140mm equivalent). The wider-angle assists in capturing portraits, landscapes, and macros. The wide angle is great for cramped areas such as museums. On top of the camera is a control wheel exclusively for Exposure Compensation. An improved 3 LCD with better color depth and a wider viewing angle.

I was looking forward to the addition of Servo AF to track moving objects or subjects. It has worked like a charm so far. They say that the Face Detection is better at recognizing people, but I have not tried it out yet. Canon says you can use ISO 1600, but you are risking image quality after ISO 200. I would use ISO 400 in an emergency.

Another thing that drew me to the G10, is the Optical Viewfinder. Its very rare these days to have one on a compact camera. Its not a %100 view, but its better than nothing at all. And its great for shooting in a situation that requires stealth, so you dont have to use the bright, crisp,and accurate LCD.

Ive purchased most of the accessories for the G10, including some that are not being distributed in the US.

I ordered the leather case (Canon SC-DC60A), from an Ebay seller who lives in Japan and ships them to the states.

The Tele-converter 1.4x TC-DC850, is a great tool to increase your reach to 198mm. but requires the installation of the Lens Adaptor LA-DC58K. You will need the lens adaptor for any lens accessories you purchase (i.e. fisheye, wideangle, filters, etc,.), so its a good thing to have.

I did not purchase the Waterproof Case WP-DC25, nor the Waterproof Case Weight WW-DC1. I dont do any underwater photography, so I want purchase this unless I plan a specific trip involving diving.</Content>

<Content>This camera has lived up to the reviews of others on this site and elsewhere. The most compelling one is at www.luminous-landscape.com where the camera is compared favorable with a Hasselblad digital system costing more than $30,000!
This is the perfect camera for traveling as its compact size combined with off the charts performance make it far more appealing than the DSLRs that I love except for their weight and bulk. My sons use it for skiing and hiking here in the Utah mountains, where it has created some stunning images. Image quality is superb given its sensor size and configuration and the camera controls, in particular the under/over exposure adjustments and manual mode, are very intuitive especially for an old film guy like me. The only negative is a higher than average noise in imaages shot at high ISOs, like 1600+ due to the small sensor size but this is easily overlooked given the ability to even get a shot in low light conditions with the IS system and light weight.
Its another winner from Canon!

<Content>The Canon G10 is my favorite, thus far. I began with the G6, then G9, and have graduated to the G10. I have also tried many other cameras, but none (within its classification or specifications) come close to the G10s quality. 

I also use the waterproof case virtually 24/7, as it keeps the unit clean, dust free, and protected from minor damage; its also excellent for outdoor photography in mostly all weather conditions in the USA and abroad.  I honestly rarely leave home without my G10 because photo opportunities may exist anywhere at anytime.

See samples of my photography/art at: http://oliostudios.blogspot.com/.  New collages photographed in Florida with the G10 will be featured soon!

Very easy to use, takes great photographs, resolution is amazing, battery lasts for a long time, easy to download the pics.
I strongly recommed you invest in a high speed memory card so you can take pics faster.  Also, get the screen protector film, the screen is large so it would be easy to scratch if left unprotected.
Its a little bulky but once you get used to it youll see that this is truly a wonderful camera all around.
I wish they would include a carrying case with the camera.</Content>

<Content>This is probably the closest Point and shoot camera to a Digital SLR. I bought this to compliment my DSLR whenever I need something more handy and quick to use. The lens quality are excellent (fairly close to DSLR lenses) and can really go wide. The IS works great and it always surprises me that it gives me great quality photos even on low light conditions. The video and picture quality are also great from underwater shots. One of the things to notice on this camera, on top of its quality photos from low light, is its speed to capture photos. This is the best PS Ive seen in the market and I am absolutely happy and satisfy about this product.</Content>

<Content>This is an excellent point and shoot camera. Given its fixed lens, you obviously wont get the same lens effects you can get with DSLRs; but at about $400 and 14.7MP, you cant go wrong. It also shoots pretty decent video, which is only net worthy. The video resolution isnt that high.
The only negative is that its pretty heavy and the for the small size, I find it a little difficult to handle/grip. The overall pic quality is very good though. The hot shoe is also very handy if you want to mount a 580EX II or something like that. The noise level in low lighting isnt that impressive to me; but Im comparing it to higher level cameras. Over all an excellent buy for the price, given the high resolution and overall quality.</Content>

<Content>Canon Powershot G10 14.7MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom

Ive had my Canon PowerShot G10 for about a week now, and Im quite pleased with my choice.

The camera (my third flagship digital camera - previous ones were Nikon and Fuji) is definitely a photographers camera, with all the controls intuitive and easy to get at.  For example, while all the digicams Ive owned had the capability to tweak exposure values,  this is the only one where one doesnt have to be a hand contortionist to do it. The camera is fast and responsive and it rivals my old Nikon Coolpix 800 in terms of picture quality (My Fuji Finepix S5100 is a little short in that area, and that was part of my motivation to get this camera).  

Now, about expectations:  One thing that is well documented in various reviews about the Powershot G10 is its poor performance (in terms of excessive noise and artifacts) in low light situations at high ISO speeds.  Indeed, I see noise starting to creep in at ISO 400 and getting worse and worse as I go from 800 to 1600.  I havent even bothered with trying ISO 3200 yet.  However, I saw those reviews, too, and knew that going in.  I rarely take pictures in those conditions, so I figured this wouldnt cramp my style too much,  so my expectations have been met.   It is quite good as long as I keep at it ISO 400 or lower.  It really shines at 100 or 200, which is where I operate mostly.   But it is definitely compromised at ISO 800 and up,  so be aware of that if youre looking for a low light camera. 

One other tip:  The PowerShot G10 uses a proprietary NB-7L battery, which Canon (and Amazon) charges a ridiculous price for.   There are generic versions of this battery (with more mAH, too) for a fraction of the cost.  So dont let the battery put you off too much.

<Content>I tried out 4 cameras at the same time, G10, D60, TZ5, and SX110IS.  The D60 was lovely, but large for packing everywhere.  The TZ5 was appealing for the simplicity, but lacked full control.  The SX110IS has a very slow flash cycle.  And then the G10 arrived.  With all the easily accessible controls in an easy-to-carry package, it was a perfect fit for me.  Its ideal to carry hiking and easy to grab for informal shots.  It doesnt make me feel guilty if I dont touch it for a week like a more expensive camera would.  It ended up being the right balance of size, features, cost, and quality of my use.

<DocID>B001G5ZTPY-92</DocID>
<Content>First, allow me to introduce myself: I am a pixel-peeper. I have to be because my clients are; Im not that way out of OCD although I do suffer from OCD. I am a DSLR user, a user of professional lenses, and someone who takes pictures for almost solely the purpose of selling them commercially.

I got started about 6 months ago looking for a compact camera that I could take with me everywhere I go, since taking my pro gear is not always feasible for a multitude of reasons. I tried out a few things personally but mostly I did exhaustive research. My standards are very high since I rarely take pictures for personal use or for fun. My research was made confusing because I have seen both excellent and not so excellent test shots made with this camera posted online. In my experience, the good ones were more accurate. Some of the test shots online seriously make me wonder since my results have been much better. Look up the online comparison between this camera and a $40,000 Hasselblad. Those are more in line with what I am seeing. I am happy to say that this camera has exceeded my expectations and I really like it generally.

I am going to randomly name a few things about this camera that I really like:

Noise: If you are like me, this is the most important issue to you. I dont do low-light shooting so low noise at low ISO is the only thing of importance to me. That being said, I have zero tolerance for noise. The noise at ISO 80 on this camera is indistinguishable from the noise of every DSLR I have used! That is such a huge deal. I wish I could have put that sentence in bold and 18 point type. I just dont see any difference, and my eye is very well trained from using Photoshop 4+ hours per day. I am positive that prints will bear out the same result. ISO 100 is virtually indistinguishable, certainly enough that in almost all photos you will not see a difference and you will almost certainly see no difference in prints either. I wont be shooting higher than ISO 100 on this camera so I cant tell you about the performance at those levels. I dont normally shoot high ISOs anyway, but I will certainly not be attempting it with a compact PS. My gut tells me that it would do well, but I simply just dont have a use for the feature so I havent checked.

Grain: to the extent that there is noise at ISO 80/100 (every digital camera ever made has some level of noise), I have to say I really like the effect! It is much more natural than recent DLSR setups I have shot with. The grain looks like a very slow film type grain. Converted to BW it looks fantastic. This will be a great camera for street photography in that sense. I can already see that there will be prints--large prints--taken with this camera that will end up on a gallery wall. I converted a few pictures I took to BW and then looked at them on a 26 LCD monitor and they look amazing. The grain is really just so realistic and artistic. I havent really commented on this with other digital cameras I have reviewed because I havent experienced such a noticeably realistic grain character with other cameras.

Color accuracy: more accurate than virtually all cameras I have used with maybe the exception of the Canon 5D.

LCD: the brightest and the most beautiful I have ever used on any camera, ever. Love the LCD.

So, any problems at all? These are totally nit-picky and I include them only to be thorough. I am not complaning anf these are nowhere near the level of being a dealbreaker for owning the camera. 

Distortion: noticeable in many cases. This is easily correctable in a variety of ways, and you will really only feel the need to correct it if you are shooting wide open or you are shooting architectural/straight-line subjects. Its a PS camera so this is to be expected anyway.

CA: not as bad as I thought so I am pleasantly surprised here, however there is some in certain shots. Again correctable and not really a big deal. Again its a PS camera so this is to be expected anyway.

Shooting at f/2.8: It is noticeably soft and the CA gets much worse here also. I wont be shooting at this aperture very often anyway, but after seeing test shots at f/2.8 I will try even harder to avoid this aperture. Anything smaller than f/2.8 and everythings fine. Again this being a PS it gets a pass.

Construction: Holding the camera right takes some getting used to. It doesnt just go into your palm like a glove like many cameras do. It takes some practice to find the right way to hold it; it isnt intuitive. The camera is also larger and heavier than I thought it would be but it is still within the limit of what I needed and the solid-ness is reassuring as far as long-term use and/or resale value is concerned.

In summation, I was worried that there were too many pixels crammed into this camera and it delayed my purchase for a while until I could do more research and hear from owners. I was assured by many owners that the MP cramming hadnt had a deleterious effect on IQ so I took a chance. Amazon does allow returns, after all, so what the hey. Im happy that I did because the camera has met or exceeded my high expectations and I will be keeping the camera. No more I wish I had a camera with me because that would make a great picture moments. This will be with me all the time.

<Content>Did a lot of research before buying the G10. This is my 4th digital camera. Ive been using it daily for a week now and Im very impressed. The macro ability is excellent - even hand held. Built in scene settings (snow, indoor, sunset, kids  pets, etc.) in addition to full auto, meaning you can handle most common situations easily. 

What sold me: 1st class build quality, incredible view screen, high resolution, direct access to exposure compensation, most exposure modes (AV, TV, Auto, Program, manual, movie and panoramic) and ISO via dedicated dials (not buried in menus!). Most other modes are only one level deep in a menu. Full manual is a snap to use, and RAW mode is easily available. The G10 has a hot shoe, but not a PC connection for external flash. 

Small gripes: I wish the scenic modes were right on the main dial, but there are so many this might not be practical. The smallish optical viewfinder (tied to the zoom) is nice, but covers only about 3/4 of the actual view, so what can I really use it for except rough estimates? 

I actually showed some of my G10 shots to a photo dept. technician and he thought theyd been taken with an SLR. If you are looking for very high quality images and SLR like versatility without the bulk of an SLR, get this camera. Its not pocket size, but it is compact and packs a lot of photographic power into that package. Ive rigged a padded fanny pack to carry it easily. Others will use a coat pocket. 

Summary: If you are tired of lugging around an SLR and lots of accessories (as I am) or even a large prosumer camera (like my Fuji S9000), you will love the G10. Worth the $400 price tag.
 
Suggestion: be careful with the LCD screen - its big and beautiful and it would be a shame to damage it. Im putting a protector on it as soon as I can.</Content>

<Content>This G10 is an upgrade to the G9 I previously owned.  I am happier with the better quality of pictures in bright light, but still the camera leaves me wanting.  I had hoped for better image quality at ISO 200-800.  Its just truly disappointing your buddy pulls out a $200 point and shoot and turns out better quality pictures at low light level situations.  I wanted this camera to be a compact DLR replacement but it is not a great camera for that.  I guess thisll go on eBay and I will buy a DLR for spectacular photos and a P/S for decent indoor pictures.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera based on the reviews, intending to use it as an everyday camera that would produce images that could easily be used for publication.  I had the Canon G2 years ago, and actually shot a magazine assignment with it (using Safesync so I wouldnt blow up the camera with my strobe equipment).  That job paid me 850.00, which paid for my G2 and hooked me on digital and the Canon G-series.

Although many reviews had reservations at the G10s noise level above base ISO, I couldnt ignore the superlatives being draped over the G10.  Ive been spoiled by the legendary 6mp Fuji Finepix F30, which, although no longer in production for a couple of years now, is still considered to be the litmus test for low noise images at relatively high ISO.  There are many geeks out there comparing the Canon G10 and the Panasonic LX3 against the F30, and quite a few are saying that the F30 is still the champ. 

I have to say the F30 would beat the G10 at higher ISOs like Pacman beat De La Hoya in that recent embarrassing title fight.  When I tested the G10 at ASA 200 at the highest JPEG level, which I thought was a reasonable ISO, I was horrified by the noise.  Blown highlights and purple fringing.  

Disappointed, I quickly returned it.   It might be great at base ISO, but when you pay nearly $500.00 for a camera, you shouldnt have to run ISO 200 images through a noise processor to come up with a usable image.  </Content>

<Content>Ive been into photography for more than 30 years and although I am not a professional, I do have some technical skill with the old SLRs.  My first digital camera was a Nikon4300 which was the first generation of cameras of this type.  It was an ok camera.  Pictures came out decent but the lag time in between shots was annoying.  It had some manual function which I liked but after 4 years of owning it I was ready to move up to something more similar to my old Minolta X700.  So I decided to try this Canon and Im not sorry I did.  Ive taken some great evening shots of NYC Times Square and I must say that they look fantastic!.  I have pets and grandchildren who are always moving about and its hard to get a great shot but this camera came through with flying colors!  The auto focus and face detection is a life saver for sure.  And it has all the manual controls I need to keep me busy with my creative side.  All in all, this camera is a gem.  It is high end for point and shoot and Im just surprised that I paid the same amount for this camera as I did for the Nikon4300 (when it was new) but hey, thats technology for you.</Content>

<Content>This camera is for someone who knows what an F stop is, as well as aperture value. ISO speeds, RAW, exposure bracketing and more. If this is all Greek to you than move on, this is not the camera for you. This camera is for professional or amateur photographers who do not want to lug their big SLR with them everywhere. This camera has amazing quality and is very easy to use. It is also extremely flexible for people who know what they are doing. Exposure compensation, ISO, and shooting modes are all conveniently located on the camera with real actual dials. The camera looks and feels very classic. All black is beautiful. Its also metal and feels Hefty. Years ago when I used to shoot with real film cameras I could drop old Minoltas and Nikons and not be too worried. This feels like it might survive a small accidental fall. The design harkens back to some small miniature Lieca, Minox, or olympus models of long lost film models. James Bond might use this. It has a large battery and also a traditional viewfinder that even lets you focus it. The manual focus on the camera is its weakest trait. You need to clumsily use the dial on the back. Had they only made the ring on the front adjust manual focus this would have been extra credit and A++. Still for a point an shoot to even have a manual focus option is great. This is a bit bulkier than the miniature card deck cameras available out there. It is still, in my opinion, small enough to put in your wifes purse, take to a wedding, and even place in ones suit pocket, minus the strap. You can buy add ons for this like a telephoto convertor and external flash. I guess if you only have this one camera and need as much flexibility as possible theses add ons could be helpful. I personally have a full frame SLR for all the times I need 100% flexibility, more lenses and such. I would only need the underwater case for this. Underwater cases for small cameras like this can be so much fun at pools and swimming at sea. All I need now is the Canon case, the underwater case and Im set.

 I am not sure why point and shoot cameras do not have the same frame proportions to current SLRs by Cannon. Perhaps someone can explain this to me. I am sure it has to do with sensor size, or printing sizes or something. Still, My 20 D and 5D Mark II both are wider while this and my older SD 750 have a more narrow, more square file format. This is a mystery to me. You can set this to current TVs 16:9 aspect ratio but that is wider than the traditional SLRs. This must be an industry thing. Also, its not a huge deal. I can not criticize the camera for this since it seems to have its origins in the industry or point and shoots in general. I only shoot with Cannons now so it remains true to other point and shoot frame file format size. 

The rear screen is very big which is nice. You can also turn it off, which is nice too, especially when you are at a dark event where the lit up screen would be an annoyance to others. You can also disable the phony shutter click. For traditionalists who like that click, there are 3 versions to choose from. If only it had a photochemical darkroom smell. :)

All in all a great camera. The price here is excellent too. I overpaid at Best Buy. 

I would like to add that Best Buy is charging $495.75 for this. They do not price match and on the phone a sales clerk lied to me and said Amazon sells only used equipment which is utter nonsense. Everyone please buy this camera from Amazon.</Content>

<Content>The G10s build quality and external controls are extraordinary, and the 3 LCD display is stunningly bright and clear. 

I gave this camera a 3 star rating because of the image quality. During the first two weeks that I owned the camera, I noticed the noisy images, but initially downplayed or ignored them. But after viewing one noisy image after another, I finally and grudgingly had to admit that the Q10 had problems. 

About a month after I purchased my camera, dpreview reviewed the G10 and compared its image quality to a Panasonic LX3. The side-by-side image comparisons were an eye opener. The LX3s images were noticeably better.

Below are quotes from the dpreview G10 review. I include them in my review of the camera because they closely echo my viewpoint:

START QUOTE from dpreview:
But the problems arise when the user gets back to a computer and downloads the images from the G10. In trying to keep ahead of the megapixel race, Canon has produced a camera that in the real world cant deliver on the promise of the styling and control layout. In the studio it produced some incredible results at base ISO, but out in the real world and as ISO settings increased, the loss of fine detail and increase in noise really let it down. A camera is ultimately about taking pictures, and that is why we put so much emphasis on the image quality output.

Considering the wider market, with pressures coming from the cheaper LX3, and with low end digital SLRs getting cheaper all the time, it is hard to see who the G10 audience will be. Mainly those who own higher end DSLRs (especially Canon ones) looking for a compact second camera? Perhaps, but these users would certainly be discriminating about image quality, and the G10 might not live up to their expectations. So the G10 is in the flawed gem category that, while great fun to take pictures with, is surpassed in image quality by other cameras in the same price range, and the same market segment. At its price the G10 just cannot overcome the image quality shortfalls to achieve our highest rating.

The G10 leaves that lingering question. Just how good could this camera have been, had Canon taken a more conservative approach to resolution and put as much effort into optimising image quality as it did into making such an impressive camera body? END QUOTE

My feelings about the G10s noise problem have ranged from denial, to excuses, and now, after having viewed hundreds of noise-contaminated images, to disgust. Canons decision to increase the G10s sensor resolution to 15 mega pixels has ruined what could have been a fabulous camera.

UPDATE January 1, 2009: To add insult to injury, the G9 is currently selling on Amazon for $499 and G10 is currently selling for $412. How often does it occur that last years model commands a significantly higher price than a newly released model? </Content>

<Content>   I bought this camera as an addition to two Digital SLRs. I guess as a point and shoot camera it is probably above average but it comes nowhere close to a digital SLR.

   The G10 is fairly heavy and large, which I consider as an advantage. External controls for exposure control are easy to operate, playback and menu options are plentiful and very elaborate (although I would call myself technically literate, I had to read the manual several times). Picture quality looks good to me, the high mega pixel count allows for some cropping without loosing too much quality. Battery life time is good for some 300 shots with extensive flash use and playback reviews.

   Even my four year old digital SLR has much less noise in the higher ISO range but then .. you can turn it into a creative composition. Exact zooming is a joke, the zoom button over- and under-shoots quite a bit, it is easier to step forward and back a few yards. The view finder maybe shows 80% of the actual photo, very disappointing, I almost never use the view finder. The large display works well, albeit very noisy as soon as the ambient light disappears. Good playback options, surprisingly there is no RGB histogram. 

   Almost as expected, most of the times there is a significant shutter delay, autofocus is slow. Any kind of action or fast portrait photography is challenging. For a camera of this size I was hoping to have a fast 2.8 lens across the whole zoom range (even at the price of a larger, more heavy and expensive camera. Ideally at a zoom range of 20-80mm). The aperture closes quickly to 4.5 or 5.6, basically placing everything into (boring) focus.

   I still like the camera and since I carry it always with me, I find myself taking a lot more photos than with a digital SLR with some large 2.8 zoom lens. The 16:9 option is a nice addition, interval shooting would have been a nice add-on as well. It seems that cameras in this price range have a lot of gimmicks, face recognition, anti-shake,  but kinda distracting from focusing on a good composition and a small tripod. I have the controls pretty much locked at Av, f2.8, center weighted, 16:9 and fill flash. Changing the battery or memory card without taken the camera off the tripod would have been helpful too.</Content>

<Content>I am a digital camera collector!  I have the Canon rebel xti and wouldnt trade it for anything, but there are times when you need portability.  I also have a canon powershot 790, love it, but needed some more pixels for extreme cropping.  After a month of research it was between the G10 and the Nikon 6000.  My previous experiences with Canon won out and I went with the G10.  Out of box experience was perfect!!  I shot about 100 photos, and was very happy!  Sure, it isnt the fastest camera on earth and needs perfect light to stop movement, but I didnt need that, the Rebel can handle that!  It is a perfect example of Canons brillant true to life colors, and the extra pixels do allow me to close crop when needed.  I also have the Panasonic Lumix FZ28 mainly for the optical zoom, and am amazed at the washed out colors of that compared to the G10.  I am especially happy with the right on top exposure compensation dial... I use that often photographing black dogs in white snow, and its great not to have to go inside to a menu to find it.  Another great feature is the hotshoe... almost impossible to avoid red eye in the dogs with built in flashes, but using my speedlight is great!  Finally, the auto white balance is right on... I am so used to doing an auto WB fix first thing in the software... didnt have to with any of the shots I took!!!  I am going on a kayaking vacation soon and cant wait to use this gem of a camera!</Content>

<Content>Sigh. This looks like a wonderful camera, except (1) Canon has fallen prey to the Megapixel Marketing Myth, and (2) the proprietary $70 battery pack.

I get superb poster-size blowups from my 7 megapixel Canon S710.  And I can carry around cheap rechargeable AA batteries, or pick up Duracells at any newsstand or grocery store in a pinch.  But I covet some of the G-series features (flash hotshoe, metal body, SLR-like exposure dial, etc.).

Id love to see Canon build a camera in the G10 form factor with AA batteries and a better (lower-pixel, lower-noise) sensor chip.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera a few weeks ago.  This was my first digital camera after years with my faithful Canon AE-1 (the film processing got expensive!).  I am very satisfied with the camera.  It is the first autofocus lense that I am truly satisfied with the response time--I leave the lense on continuous focus.  It pays to spend time with the manual.  The icons may be intuitive to someone with digital experience, but I found study helpful.  It was also important to set up the default settings by stepping through the manual page by page.  Also, I purchased the teleconverter attachment which I recommend to anyone seeking to extend the 5X range.  It is important to set the camera to teleconverter to avoid vignetting. All in all, I have been pleased with the purchase.  </Content>

<Content>Before I gush over the actual camera, let me get this out: I hate the software. I used Kodaks software for the last 4 years, and loved the simplicity of it. With Kodak, all you have to do is plug in the camera and go. All I want is to see my videos, see my photos, and easily crop the photos. Period.

The Canon software wont let me view my videos at all, even though there are no less than 4 separate Canon programs to install. None of those 4 programs allow me to view the video. One of the pieces of software is only for one kind of Canon camera, which I dont have, and the other two programs are basically the same thing. Neither of those have a crop button--really! I can mess with the colors and do all this fancy stuff but I cant crop. 

So, basically, all the software is essentially useless for me after the photos get downloaded into the My Pictures file of my computer. Then I have to use Picassa or some other software. Although, when I took the memory card out of the Canon and put it into the Kodak, the Kodak software worked just fine, so I might just do that. 

Anyway, other than crap software, the camera is amazing. Obviously, I wanted simple, but my husband wanted complicated. We both got what we wanted. I operated all of the features I wanted without touching the instruction manual. The anti-blur, face detection, and red-eye reducer are all automatic and work very well (you can turn them off if you want). You can easily turn the flash on or off. There is an easy Macro setting. Working the timer is also easy, and there is one timer that detects when all of the faces are looking at the camera before taking the picture. The many SCN settings are found by just turning the wheel. Best of all, this camera is super-fast. I can turn it on and take a picture almost as soon as I see what I want to photograph. Zooming is pretty fast, too.

Like I mentioned, though, my husband wanted complicated. He wanted to be able to adjust all the settings, including the aperture and a bunch of other things. He can. There are tons of settings that I carefully avoid and, for those people (like him) who know what all those settings mean, they can spend hours getting exactly the photo they want. My husband will have to work hard to outgrow the abilities of this camera, and I bet the software would work well for him, as it is definitely intended for someone more at his level than mine.

The photos and videos from the Canon work on Blogger just fine, and dont take any longer to upload, which was vital for me. 

In summary, the camera and software are great for people who want a point-and-shoot with lots of capabilities, while the camera is equally great for people who want a fast, easy-to-use camera that gives you high-quality, crisp photos for printing or Blogging. </Content>

<Content>Got this camera for Christmas and cannot be more happy with it.  I own several digital cameras including a Canon Rebel XTI and a Canon A1000.  I feel the pictures from the G10 are as good as or in some cases better than those I get with the XTI.  Have not had it long enough to explore all the options this camera offers but so far the pictures are great, the response time is fast, and it feels well in the hand.  I have ordered several larger size SD cards to take advantage of the large 14 mega pixil size photos that this camera takes.  The average size file is between 5.5 and 6.5 megabits depending on the subject and this is just shooting JPEG.  I cannot wait to take this camera on vacation and really put it to the test.  I am sure the results will be beyond expectation.  Bottom line, love this camera!</Content>

<Content>Canon Powershot G10 14.7MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom  I am a serious amateur photographer.  I want a camera that will perform in all types of situations.  The G-10 is a successor to the prior top end range finder digital cameras in the Canon line. It is more expensive than most range finder digitals but I think it is well worth it.  

The new model offers a 5X Optical Zoom (28 MM lens).  It allows full control of ISO and White Balance and a number of other features that can be toggled - like Image Stabilization.  Plus the image quality is up to 14.7 MP.   I normally shoot with a 40D SLR but there are times when I simply do not want to carry along lenses and the other equipment.  I first used this on a trip to Veracruz, Mexico and tried to push the limits of the camera.  I dont like flash photography except in exceptional circumstances.  With the available controls I was able to get the shots I wanted.  That included some macro shots which would have been chancy with any other range finder camera.  The G-10 has a large view finder to be able to see what you shot.   

I will continue to use my SLR but the handy size and bounty of features will make this a prime candidate for everyday use.  If you want to see some of the results of this camera - check out my shots from Tajin or the Cortez landing site on my FLickr site at [...]</Content>

<Review>
<DocID>B001G5ZTPY-113</DocID>
<Content>A tool can be rated as to how well it lets you accomplish your task with a desired result.   
NOTE that in the description quoted from Digital Photography Review in Amazons write-up, DPRs Image Quality rating of only 8 was OMITTED (!) as was the Overall Rating, which was Recommended instead of Highly Recommended.
What a coincidence! Amazon just omits things that do not suit them.
Digital Photography Review was NOT overwhelmed by the G10s performance. Perhaps because using ISOs over 200 results in too much noise. Perhaps because subjects with less than great contrast tend to produce softer images.  Maybe because using f/stop numbers higher than 5 tend to soften images a bit because of diffraction.  I also own a Canon G6 (7 MP). It has a pixel density of 19 MP/cm2.  The G10 has a whopping pixel density of 34 MP/cm2.  My old Canon 5D DSLR has a pixel density of 1.5 MP/cm2.  As you may know, high pixel density is a detriment to capturing great images.
I purchased the G10 as a grab-and-go-backup for when I didnt feel like shlepping all of my DSLR gear ... I also purchased (and reviewed on Amazon) the nice Canon A650 IS.
The bottom line is that VERY FEW compact digital cameras will produce images even close to DSLRs - your grab-and-go image will ALMOST ALWAYS be imperfect if you are a stickler.
SO, why take any small camera with you that will produce lesser images- youll smack your forehead and say I could have taken my DSLR! just like in the V8 commercial. BUT, if you simply MUST take a small camera, why not take a small camera that costs less than the G10?  Like the Canon A650 IS, still findable on the internet for less than on Amazon.
Yes the G10 has some very ergonomic controls and is flexible,
although it is not pocketable.
Yes it has a very nice LCD screen. And if all youve ever taken pictures with are Canons Elph digicams,  the G10 will be a big step up. 
If all you take are images that will be 6 x 4 inch prints, this G10 camera will do the job (though you can get cheaper and LIGHTER
digicams to do that job). Even 8 x 10s will be OK much of the time with the G10. With a tripod, even larger prints are do-able
with reasonable quality.
I have a big bunch blue ribbons for photography from camera clubs, juried exhibitions (and sales), and galleries.
Only ONE of all of those blue ribbons was awarded to me for an
image that came came from a compact digicam. That ONE came from the Canon G6.

SO, as far as the G10 being a REAL DSLR backup? .... maybe not so much. Given the choice, youll always take the DSLR if the image quality matters to you.  That leaves the G10 in the drawer.
BAD camera? NO.  GREAT camera? NO.</Content>

<Content>My main reasons for buying this camera were the advantages it has over my Canon S80.  I like the RAW mode, the flash hot shoe, the ND Filter, and the better ergonomics.  I had skipped the earlier G models because I prefer the wider 28mm (equiv.) lens.  My main worry, after reading reviews here and elsewhere, was the reported high noise at ISO 400 and above.  What I wanted to know was whether I would have to suffer higher noise on the G10 than on my lower resolution S80.  The answer is no.

Maybe the G10 has high noise compared to some other camera or compared to some objective standard.  I find the G10 image quality is a step up from my S80, and the S80 is pretty darn good.

I posted a side-by-side comparison. See for yourself.

<Content>I have owned this camera for a few weeks now, and love it. I stepped up from the Canon SX100, and have found this camera to be worth the extra money. The auto mode works extraordinarily well. I was afraid that the G10 would be more complicated than I could handle, but I just use auto and experiment as I choose. 
The video is remarkable. My camcorder ran out of room on the card, so I recorded a singer on the G10, and, all things considered, found the music very listenable. It is small, so I can carry it anywhere, in contrast to a larger DSLR. The images are sharp. Macro is fun to play with as well as the digital zoom. The SX100 had 10X zoom, and I did lose a little bit, but with a tripod, the G10 goes up to 20X, though the images are rarely useful....but sometimes it all comes together. The li-ion battery lasts forever, and I am sure the cost for a spare will come down. Not having to fiddle with a lens cover is great. All in all, a great investment in fun. Hugh</Content>

<Summary>How can a point and shoot camera get better than this?</Summary>

<DocID>B001G5ZTPY-117</DocID>
<Content>Ive never written an Amazon review for any product before, but I feel that Canon has done such a superb job with the G10 that they deserve some kind words.

I am the former Color Editor at Popular Photography Magazine. I normally use a digital SLR, but I wanted a smaller, simpler camera for use in taking photos from an aircraft. I needed a camera that I could hold securely in one hand while flying the aircraft with the other. I have a Canon Elf, but its almost impossible to hold the camera in one hand as its just too small. 

I guess I bought the G10 for its grip-ability. I assumed it would take reasonably good photos because Ive always been happy with the digital Elf, but I was unprepared for how good it is. If youre a serious amateur or a pro, you will be more than happy with the photographs the G10 produces. The results are stunning. The feature set is just as good. Your every need has been anticipated and a control positioned closely at hand. Easy ISO setting, exposure compensation, and control of flash output for sync-sun shooting are all easily at hand. There are even two custom settings that allow you to pre-program the features youll need for special applications. I use one which sets the shutter speed at shutter priority at 1/1000 sec. and the focus pre-set at infinity for air to ground photography. I use a the second custom setting with the shutter priority set at 1/100 sec for taking photos that include the spinning propeller. High shutter speeds freeze the prop making it look as if the engine has stopped. I programmed it so it also kicks in the neutral density filter and again the focus set at infinity.

Frankly, the results from the G10 are so good, that if I didnt have such a large investment in another brand of Digital SLR lenses, I would switch to Canon SLRs because of the G10. Its always the lenses, not the bodies that keep you with a particular brand of camera.

I could go on and on telling you how wonderful the G10 is and how much its like a digital Leica, but I think you already get the idea. Just go buy one!</Content>

<Content>If you want modern features with the ease of point and shoot (especially when you put it in AUTO mode) get this camera!  I also highly recommend this accessory: the Canon 430EX Speedlite Flash.  Why?  If you take pics indoors youll never have a dark photo again.  Those small built-in (camera) flashes just dont perform well - unless youre in ideal lighting circumstances.

Make the investment in both this camera and the 430EX flash and youll be set for a very long time.</Content>

<Content>Canon Powershot G10 14.7MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized ZoomI see complaint after complaint about grain at higher ISOs. Think film, with photo film at ISO100 for fine grain (even lower with slides and B  W) and increasing grain with 200, 400 and 800 speed film. It is simply a trade off; an option is longer exposures with slower speed film. Technology is pushing back some of these problems but dont forget Hubble took 10 DAYS for the deep field pictures. The G10 is an excellent camera if you dont expect miracles.  </Content>

<Content>I had the G10 for a week and it took amazing pictures in the daytime, easily DSLR quality shots.  The were very crisp, and when set to Vivid mode they were perfectly saturated and gorgeous on my 50 plasma HDTV.  Unfortunately, the shots I took at night, in dim light, and indoors were a different story.  They were all plagued by noise, or strange smeared looking detail-less photos because of the extreme digital noise reduction that takes place inside the camera.  In less than optimal lighting the camera tries to compensate for the high amount of noise brought on by too many pixels packed into a tiny point and shoot sensor on longer exposures by using DNR right when you shoot.

Another huge flaw for me was the lack of ability to shoot HD video.  Last years model had this feature, why remove it now in a time when HDTVs are now more popular and affordable ever!  On top of that the video format used in the G10 is a horrible .mov apple format that wont work with Windows Movie Marker, one of the most easy to use and not to mention free programs around.  Before, I was able to pop my SD card out of my camera, and into my PS3 and watch the movies I took on my HDTV instantly.  Now with the G10 my PS3 doesnt even play the video format, and the PS3 supports nearly ever popular video file(avi, WMV, mpeg2, mpeg4).  So that sucked for me big time because my other three Canon cameras do just fine, with a much more popular .avi video file.  

The G10 was going for $455 a few weeks ago(12/10/2008), and now can be had for $375 on sale if you watch the prices enough... looks like the word is getting out.  As a matter of fact, its more expensive to purchase last years G9 model new.  Thats saying something.  Hopefully these camera companies will stop the megapixel race or buff up their sensors.  In the mean time I recommend you either get a much cheaper regular point and shoot like the Canon SD 790, or a true entry level DSLR like the Nikkon D40. 

Also to note, my camera shipped with a slight lens error, and I sent it back for a replacement through Amazons excellent customer service, and that worked fine.  Yours probably wont, its very rare and can happen to any camera, but I just thought I would mention it.</Content>

<Content>I was hoping to find a camera that felt like a camera, handled more like a digital SLR, but was still highly portable. I researched and researched several and kept coming back to the G10. I read reviews from every camera rating service I could find and then I read the reviews by the typical user. I took this very seriously having already purchased two pocket-sized digitals which were okay, but not what I wanted and in my job I have experience with the Nikon D70, D90, and D40 and didnt want a full-sized DSLR. In the end, I decided that even if the camera produced noise above ISO 200--it was the camera for me. So, I plucked down my credit card to Amazon and ordered last week. It came a few days later and this weekend I got to spend several hours snapping away. I will say I am SOLD on this camera. While Im not a professional, I do quite a bit of photography as part of my job. I made the right choice. Thanks Canon.</Content>

<Content>The Canon G10 is a wonderful, powerful point and shoot camera with full manual control. It combines a great mix of attributes that add up to a fantastic camera to carry everywhere. I have been toting it all over Manhattan and have shot hundreds of pictures now. Having the creative control to set aperture and shutter speed allows one to fine tune exposure in a way that has not really been possible with point and shoots. The fact that it shoots large raw files is an added bonus. I am a little put out with Adobe for not including G10 support in a version of camera raw that works with CS3. Grrrrr. It is really nice to be able to work a raw file and have the same flexibility that I do with the files from my D200. The battery seems to have been conjured up by the enegizer bunny, it just keeps going and going. It literally will go for hundreds of shots between charges. The control layout also works very well. The exposure compensation dial on the left side is so easy to manipulate when you are shooting in either full auto, aperture priority, or shutter priority. ISO and shooting mode on the right are also easy to access. The controls all feel very solid and provide positive feedback as they are manipulated. The camera fits nicely in a coat pocket and I recommend the Kata DP 415 belt pouch as an alternative. This camera is perfect for a photographer looking for creative control and best in class image quality. There is a great in depth article about the camera on the Luminous Landscape website 

http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/pocket-battleships.shtml

The only people I would advise to steer away from this model are those for whom size is a much bigger priority than image quality. If you are just a casual shooter looking for a snap shooter there are probably better alternatives.</Content>

<Content>I have spent hours fooling around with this camera, taking pictures, checking the manual, taking more pictures, etc.  All the stuff in the manual makes the camera seem overly complex, but if the more you mess with it the more it all makes perfect sense.  Meanwhile, the pictures are great!  Got a nice picture of Zeke, my 11-yr old Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and my pal Williamson, a pro-sumer photog, said that the picture actually made Zeke look young.  I can take decent pictures using the large LCD display without having to use my grampa glasses.  Big improvement over the postage stamp display on my Minolta DiMage X, which I have been using for the last few years.  

Man, I can hardly wait to get this thing out on some motorcycle rides.  Its easy to change the picture resolution.  Ill run it at about 1 Mb for general shooting, and then bump it to the highest rez .jpg for pictures where we all line our bikes up and have some mountain in the background.  

I like this much better than my wifes Nikon D70S.

<Content>Bought this camera in a BEST BUY store in lower broadway here in Manhattan. That was a very silly decision of me to buy it in that store. I will get back to this a little later. I had great hope for this camera as i shoot a lot of macros of jewelry and fine watches. Previous cameras were either lost or given as a gift so i decided to buy this G10. I also considered a Canon XSI which would produce the best in-door pictures with its big sensor and sharp optics if bought seperately. Clearly i opted for this one trying to get something compact for carrying aroung in a bag on a day-to-day basis. My verdict? I`m greatly disappointed. I chose a P-mode and tried to adjust things in a camera settings. My first disappointment was when i didn`t find a Sharpness setting. That`s too bad, then i couldnt find a contrast mode... Was that for real, i kept asking myself. Ok, lets give it a try. All the pictures i took indoors came out flat, dim and ugly. Even compared to my previous Lumix fx8 that i gave to my father on a trip overseas were bad enough. Panasonic simply beats G10 by a margin. I returned the camera even though they charged me 15% of restocking fee. That was my fault, i should have bought in a dedicated camera store like Broadway 17St or JR... I lost roughly 75$$ but still was eager to return it. Now i`m exploring reviews of Panasonic LX3, i will probably go for it. </Content>

<Content>I bought the G10 so as not to bring around a DSLR (400D). After looking at lots of G10 samples on the Internet, I felt that the ISO performance matches my F31fd. Ill do my review in the good and bad point format.

Im a hobbyist and dont print photos. All my photos are for web view typical 1024px wide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Image quality
- Image quality is very good for a PS camera. The colours for my photos turned out really well. And theres RAW for more tweaking.

Focal length
- Great range at 28-140mm. My typical usage on a DSLR is 28-88mm equivalent. I rarely go up to 140mm.

Lens speed
- Its great at the wide end f2.8. But goes down to f4.5 on the telephoto. Focusing on this end is slow.  Ive a lot of blurred people shots when shooting at f4.5. Ive to turn the ISO up very high.

Noise
- I felt that its comparable to my F31fd, which means its great. Your noise tolerance might be different. For me, and my web images, I can go up to ISO 800. The drawback is contrast and color starts degrading at higher ISOs. My view on noise is: As long as it doesnt distract the viewer from the photo, its alright.

Dials
- The exposure, ISO and mode dials are brilliant. I shoot at wrong ISO on my DSLR frequently, not on the G10.

Design and build
- Excellent. Feels really good in hand.

Battery life
- Excellent. It can go up to 400 shots.

File transfer speed
- True USB2.0 speed. Its very fast.

Menu
- Clear and simple

LCD
- Large, clear and bright.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bad
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Focusing speed
- This is major drawback. Even at f2.8, it focuses as fast as I can say focusing. Its worse at f4.5. Im very impatient and always press the shutter full without looking at the LCD focus to get the shot. Its very challenging to do people shots, almost impossible when the subjects are slightly moving, unless again the ISO is very high.

Speed of the camera
- When reviewing images, half pressing the shutter will take a split second to go back to shooting mode. After shooting, the image takes another split second to appear on LCD for review. Im pampered by my DSLR which offers instant switching between review and shoot mode.

Speed of the zoom
- There are seven stops. It seems to take forever from wide to telephoto. If I see a great shot and my camera is not in the correct zoom range, I have the dreaded feeling of missing the shot.

14.7MP
- Theres no real advantage here with respect to noise. Theres no difference in noise level from shooting 5MP and 14.7MP at any ISO. Image quality is the same if I shoot big and scale down. You can print larger images though, but I dont print.

Optical viewfinder
- 77% coverage. Its almost useless to use it for framing. Every time I accidentally move the viewfinder to my eyes to use it, I feel disappointed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be honest, even though it takes great pictures, I was very disappointed by all the functional speed issues. Im very surprised that most of the reviews Ive read on the Internet said it was a snappy performance camera. Maybe my expectations are too high comparing it to a DSLRs speed. 

Its not fair to compare the image quality to a DSLR so I wont. But given its small sensor, I must say it produces spectacular photos.

But the thing is, sometimes a great picture moment only appears for an instant. If the camera isnt fast enough to capture that, spectacular photos doesnt matter anymore.

For me, an impatient guy, the drawback on speed is enough to balance all the good points.

I would recommend this camera for shooting things that dont move a lot, e.g. landscape, holidays with posing people etc.</Content>

<Content>Face it: when one buys a camera these days, one buys a computer, and it has to be learned.  Dont let that stop you because you can set the G10 to AUTO(ISO)-AUTO(mode) and grow from there.  Once I read pages 47 and 49 of the 300-page manual I really felt that I had a grip and the rest quickly fell into place.  I would suggest exploring the seventeen scene modes, which are sometimes ironically called amateur modes --those are devised by people with expertise not only in photography but in this camera as well.  (The night snapshot mode is neat!)  Tip for newbies:  no features can substitute for a basic photography course.  :-)

For the serious: it can shoot in raw mode, has a hot shoe and tripod mount, and does AWB.  One has several choices for how to auto-focus and where to meter light.  To pick an example of the internal processing capabilities: you can show one color and have the rest of the shot in black and white.  

This is a mature product with well thought-out controls.  Its a rugged little unit that I just pack without its own case.  It has taken an immoderate amount of jostling and bumping against hard surfaces without a glitch.  My only beef was that the power switch on mine requires a hard press, but now Im glad because that may be keeping it from coming on inside my suitcase.

One feature that makes my life easier:  when I get to my destination I can just change the time zone instead of the date  time.

Since I dont need a case to carry any sundries, I just use the included strap.  I can sling the strap over a shoulder and then pull a polo-style shirt on over it.  The shirt keeps the camera from bouncing around too much, and the strap is long enough to allow me to pull the camera out of the neck and shoot a picture.  It also conceals the camera.

Battery life is astounding, especially for a camera with a CCD (as opposed to CMOS) sensor!  I just got back from a two-week trip and never used the charger.  I only shot a couple hundred photos (but mostly with flash) and one-minute movies, but I did plenty of viewing.  The power indicator still shows full.

The G10 software will not install on my tiny netbook computer due to the netbooks limited resolution (1024x600 maximum).  But the netbook will still read images, either from the camera or directly from the SD card.  Canons software is not without its aggravations but there is a toll-free support line with helpful, native-english-speaking technicians answering it.

I set out to find the best compact for times I dont want to lug SLR equipment, and I am convinced that I found it.  I am an inveterate Nikon chauvinist but readily chose this over Nikons new p6000.</Content>

<Content>The G10 gets trashed in reviews by people who expect it to take its nearly 15 megapixels on a tiny sensor and give results akin to a full-frame DSLR.  Well, thats just plain dumb.  If thats what you expect, think again.  If you want the highest possible image quality even at high ISOs, you should save up the $$$$ for that DSLR.  Or, better yet, learn photographic technique and processes and buy an 8x10 view camera with a heavy tripod and get the best in image quality.  

The G10 is what it is.  It is a well-built, versatile, small camera that is highly capable in highly capable hands and still very functional to those less capable.  Its a camera for the person who uses bigger cameras who doesnt always want or need to carry a bigger camera.  It produces satisfying results and it has a super good lens that covers the most useful focal length range (35mm equivalent 28mm to 135mm--I know, it says it goes to 140mm but 135mm is a traditional focal length and 5mm +/- doesnt matter at all when you get into the telephoto range).

My background includes three plus decades in photography as a former professional to present enthusiast.  Taking up digital photography some time back, I discovered theres not much difference in the practice compared to using film.  Many people try to complicate things, but photography is still pretty basic.  You dont have to be a deep thinker, you just have to see things.  I like equipment that doesnt get in the way of seeing.  Ive been using the G10 for the past week and Im impressed with the results Ive gotten.  I also like the way it handles.  For a number of years, I have used Canon EOS film cameras and more recently DSLRs.  The ergonomics and functions of the G10 seem fairly familiar to me.  Ive also used Leica rangefinders when I wanted something smaller and quieter for candid photography on trips or when attending events.  The G10 fits nicely into this niche and for a heckuva lot less than a Leica M8 digital.  

Ive shot 35mm Tri-X and HP5+ film pushed to high ISOs in order to accomplish pictures under low light without using flash.  Im familiar with grain.  Its not my enemy.  Its not a bad thing.  It just is.  So when people complain of noise at high ISOs with the G10, I have to respond, So what?  The important thing is not that there is grain or noise in the picture, its whether or not the picture you took was worth taking.  Image quality is secondary under those circumstances.  The G10 pictures are perfectly fine under these circumstances.  

But if you have to ask about image quality at the lower ISOs, the G10 does a great job.  JPEGs straight from the camera are excellent.  There are two custom functions that can be set to your preferences.  I have one set for black and white and one set for super vivid color.  I also have been shooting in RAW and Ive gotten good results here as well.  Im still playing with RAW conversions from this camera.  The conversion process seems a little more cumbersome than how it is done with my Canon DSLRs software.  Im still in the learning process in the regard.  Im probably complicating a process that is really not that complicated.

Who would benefit from using this camera?  Just about anyone from the vacation/family/holiday chronicler of events to the seasoned professional looking for a pro-grade point and shoot (a contradiction in terms, I agree).  It produces great results shooting in bright light at low ISOs and the results under low light at higher ISOs is only a cause for concern if your expectations are too high. 

UPDATE May 30, 2009:

Ive used this camera for six months now.  It has replaced my dSLR for most general shooting.  RAW works great and BW JPEGs rival results from film.  Im still more interested in prints than in viewing photos on a monitor and tightly cropped 8.5x11 prints from the G10 really look good.  Sure, they will fall apart if you enlarged to billboard size but who really prints billboards?  BW photos at ISO 400 are not at all noisy compared to Tri-Xs grain.  Outside in good light, using ISO 80, the quality is amazing, especially shooting RAW and processing the image yourself.  You can even get interesting grain-like effects using high ISOs and playing with exposure compensation.  Its a very versatile camera.

The camera is now well used with a lot of scuffs on the LCD and a couple of scratches on the lens, but it continues to function perfectly. It was getting so much use, I decided to buy the Canon leather case to slow down the wear and tear.  

Yeah, the camera could be better.  A larger sensor would enhance high ISO image quality.  A faster lens would make life easier for those of us who hate electronic flash and refuse to carry tripods everywhere.  Both of these changes would result in a heavier, larger camera so maybe its best to accept the G10 as it is.

<Content>This is my fourth G Series Canon Camera. I am drawn to it because I have been always in need of a secondary camera to supplement by Canon DSLR. I would much rather have a smaller point n shoot with larger image sensor size than one with more megapixels. Canon is caught up in this race created by false marketing that more mega pixels means better pictures. We do not need more mega pixels. Canon should concentrate on other aspects such as image sensor size, camera response time, AF response time, higher ISO capability with less grain, etc. Having said all this, the camera really feels solid in the hand ... well built and substantial. Most people will love it. DSLR owners will be a little more reluctant to sing its praises!</Content>

<Content>   This camera is just amazing. Its what I needed to start with as my first digital camera. The learning curve has been interesting and fun and smooth. It is like a good first girlfriend: teaching me things quietly and sweetly and beautifully every day I take her out on the road with me. And I wouldnt trade her away for a million bucks. My next camera will have to be even more awesome and even easier to operate and learn from than thins one; and it will have a hard act to follow.
   I would suggest that you folks would make the handbook with glossy paper and with plenty of color; possibly color coding the sections in the book and the buttons on the back of the camera to correspond with the explanations in those sections.

<Content>I have many Canon cameras--35mm film and DSLR models. I bought the G10 to give to someone. However, I soon learned that this model is flawed. Its a great camera for shots in perfect outdoor light situations, but when the ISO increases the images are the worst pixilated images Ive seen. For example, at ISO 400 and minus 1 stop exposure, even RAW images arent recoverable. At ISO 200 youll have to work in Photoshop to get a good image. 

Generally, photographers consider that the small sensors used in PS cameras barely make the grade--they cant handle low-light and the on camera flash is an out of control light-source. The G10 goes a long way to prove how bad it can get with a PS. 

That said, the reason I purchased the G10 from Amazon is because of their no-hassle refund and Im glad I did in this case.

I used to shoot with a Canon 5D that has exceptional image quality but being too bulky with lenses I rarely took it in trips. 
the Canon G10 on the other hand is very easy to pack and carry around and the image quality is very good also .  has so many features , it takes time to learn how to really use them all. 
I highly recommend it to people who care about good quality photo equipment !  
it is an excellent  tool  in  the hand of creative photographers. </Content>

<Content>Im a semi-pro photographer. I own several Canon SLRs. I wanted an easy-to-carry, feature-packed, sneaky cam -- something that I could take great shots with that would not bring attention to me. This camera is absolutely perfect. 0 complaints. I LOVE that most of the camera settings have a dial or button right on the camera (I hate software menus); ISO, Exposure, Aperture, shutter, manual mode dials are all easily accessible.
If youre looking for a camera that shoots in RAW and takes stunning pictures, this one is for you.</Content>

<Content>The G10 is an amazing camera. I bought it two weeks ago based on Michael Reichmans (luminouslandscape website) and Thom Hogans (bythom[...]) reviews.  I am an advanced amateur/prosumer -- I sell fine art landscapes, and have been photographing for about 35 years.

The G10 is heavy at about a pound, but I like the heft. It is quite compact (at least from my perspective) -- the lens fully retracts and it will fit in a large jacket pocket. I have a medium-large Zing pouch I put it in and carry in my backpack, or alternatively put the Zing pouch on my belt loop.

Im astonished at the image quality and functionality offered by the G10. I havent shot any jpegs, only RAW (using DPP to process RAW; the RAW images will no doubt be more malleable with other software when they support the G10 -- DPP is fairly limited).  In RAW, at ISO 80 on a tripod, I think the detail rendered by the G10 exceeds or at least equals the Canon 5D. It may have a weaker or virtually no AA filter.

The lens on the G10 is fantastic. There is very little resolution fall off, even wide open, edge to edge and into the corners.

In my mind, the closest equivalent to the G10 is a Fuji 645 medium format rangefinder (remember the small zoom range Fuji 645 compact?), but the G10 is better in almost every way.  The G10 is far lighter and more compact, offers a great zoom range (and is sharp throughout the zoom range) and image stabilization, and has enough resolution to produce fine art quality prints, up to 18 or 24 in the long dimension without stitching.

I think the G10 is opening up a whole new world of landscape, street photography possibilities, and what about the incredible macro versatility?

There is a substantial drop off in image quality from ISO 200 to ISO 400 on the G10, but ISO 400 is still very very good (again shooting RAW), much better than the panasonic LX3 that I tried  for a week or two at ISO 400.

I must be crazy. I cant believe a compact with such a small sensor can render detail this well. Im seeing the G10 as a whole new tool that will open up different possibilities and different ways of seeing (and have different limitations than a Canon DSLR). I havent been this excited about a photographic tool since I purchased my Canon 5D over 3 years ago.

The Canon G10 offers automatic settings that I havent tried.  For an advanced photographer it offers a wealth of manual controls and customization, which Im still learning.  One very nice touch is that the custom settings on the top dial (there are two) allow you to save the zoom settings and manual focus setting -- so I have one saved at a 35mm focal length equivalent and another at a 50mm equivalent.  This allows quick, street shooting, similar to what one can do with a Leica rangefinder, though the G10 has a much different look given the virtually infinite depth of field due to the small sensor.</Content>

<Content>The G10 will respond right away, it wont jam like the typical point and shoot cameras that the moment is gone by the time you get to take the picture. Various shooting modes and the lighting techniques from cloudy to tungsten light make it very nice for setting the mood. The only problem as I have read from previous reviews, at night its quite grainy. Most of this is solved with flash but sometimes you dont want it. I recommend you adjust the exposure and shoot manually.

<Content>I bought this camera, waited, got ticked off at the price drop then it arrived. Charged the battery (doesn;t that suck with electronics, you get the thing and then wait till the battery charges 8 hours) I get it, plug it in and turn it on. And let me say, I was laying on my stomach on a bed with the camera facing down. When the camera turned on it was about 2 inches from this throw blanket thing. On the screen I could count every thread with no blur. I said out loud. Wow.....that;s ****in ridiculous
I think went on to use the camera in the last 2 days. Ive taken outdoor shots, art gallery photos, night shots etc. The best thing is, in galleries, flash cameras are not allowed. This thing sucks light from some cosmos unknown, leaving me with perfect shots and leaving them thinking....You jerk. 
The camera starts up in less than a second, its not big and bulky at all. It cannot fit in your pocket, so dont buy this camera if its just for you and your friends to post pictures on myspace. (p.s. your lame) buy this camera if you want photos that capture every imagine perfectly. Has a screen that makes me want to watch movies on (its a 3 LCD that is simply amazing). Im taking this to Rome soon. And I know that it will capture the best pictures possible. And then a little gypsie will steal it. And Ill be sad. But when I rebuy another, this will be the one I buy. </Content>

I really like the menu and navigation setup on the camera,we actually prefer the size of the camera as comapared to the ultra compacts. Its well built and made in Japan not China. Auto settings work well,as well as SCN settings or if you have the knowledge the manual controls allow you to take further control. Pictures can be a little noisy at high ISOs and and photoshop wont work with RAW FILES but overall we love this camera.</Content>

<Content>got it last week and it is stunning...
- the image quality is really great (even with iso 400 do not worry).
- love to do macro shots (flowers), traveling light up in trees and getting wonderfull quality.
- the lcd quality is great the first camera where i can see on the spot if to erase the shot or to keep it.
- the little control up on the right( -2...+2) is really great, you can do a shot go a bit down a bit up and one of the three shots is perfect.
- even the build in flash gives nice results indoors
- anyway it is a great camera im nearly happy that someone stole my dslr bag and i cannot aford a new dslr....

very good camera, lots of fun, easy to carry around, tons of great features, do not regret a $ i spent

<Content>My title sounds like Im damning this camera with faint praise, but its actually seriously intended.  By its type, I mean a high-quality, traditional rangefinder-type configuration (specifically including a viewfinder) with advanced amateur or better controls, RAW capability, hot shoe, and a decent lens.  

In the digital world, with current technology - no matter how much you spend - that involves compromises.  Do I wish that Canon had opted for a sensor with fewer megapixels?  Yes.  Would I like a better viewfinder?  Yes.  Are there noise issues, even at fairly modest ISO values?  Yes. Is it a bit of a brick?  Yes again.

Its still the single best camera of its type on the market.  I had high hopes for the Nikon P6000, but those were dashed by its write performance and loss of settings when shooting RAW.  The G10 has a well-implemented feature set, good controls, and very good image performance over a range of reasonably bright conditions.  While its imaging performance falls off in other conditions, so does that of lesser cameras as well - the difference is just not that dramatic.  

The best alternative right now is probably Panasonics Lumix DMC-LX3.  While it does not have a viewfinder and involves other compromises I would not make, there is no doubt whatsoever that its imaging performance is excellent - and surpasses that of the G10.  

Long story short: Until better sensors come along, the G10 is the best you will find.  Fortunately, as the hype is subsiding because of the emergence of reviews showing the real performance of this camera (i.e., including its limitations), prices are starting to come down just a bit as well.  

UPDATED! - November 25th, 2008.  Digital Photography Review (dpreview dot com)finally published a review of this camera.  It just missed the highly recommended category, making recommended (only).  The camera was knocked down somewhat by its poor noise performance (some noise evident even at 80 ISO), some chromatic aberration, and barrel distortion (the latter at wide angles), and highlight clipping.  It got good marks for build quality and handling, controls, RAW performance, decent flash, good stabilization, and good included software.</Content>

<Content>The Canon Powershot G10 is a solid successor to the Powershot G9.  Very well built with a beautiful bright display.  The retracting lens makes this an easy camera to carry around.  This high-end prosumer camera has many features of the larger DSLR cameras in a more compact package.  The image quality is very, very good.  Full manual controls allow the photographer to experiment with the more creative aspects of digital photography, but the automatic settings assist with creating wonderful photos too.  The Powershot G10 is best suited for someone looking for more features and better image quality than a smaller, cheaper camera can provide, without the large size (and potentially large expense) of a digital SLR camera kit.</Content>

<Content>  IN THE G10, CANON HAS CREATED A COMPACT DIGITAL CAMERA THAT IS A WORTHY AND EASY TO CARRY COMPANION TO MY DSLR.  THIS IS THE ONE THAT HAS MY MOST DESIRABLE FEATURES AND QUALITY AT A FAIR PRICE.
   IMAGE QUALITY AT 100 AND 200 IS SHARP AND SHOWS LITTLE NOISE.  400 IS NOISIER BUT IS ACCEPTABLE AND ESSENTIALLY OF LITTLE OR NO CONSEQUENCE ESPECIALLY IN 4 X 6 PRINTS.  IMAGE STABILIZATION FUNCTIONS PROPERLY AS IT SHOULD. THE WIDE 28 TO 140 LENS IS FAST AND LOSES LITTLE APERTURE AT FULL ZOOM COMPARED TO MOST OTHER SIMILAR CAMERAS. AN OPTICAL VIEWFINDER, HIGHER RATIO ZOOM RANGE AND INTERNAL FLASH ARE WELCOMED FEATURES MISSING ON AT LEAST ONE MUCH HIGHER PRICED CAMERA.
  RAW CAPTURE AND RAW/JPEG FURTHER ADD TO VERSATILITY AND HIGHEST IMAGE QUALITY CUSTOMIZATION WHEN NECESSARY OR DESIRED.  A SHARP, REAL MACRO RANGE ALLOWS FOR CAPTURE OF VERY FINE DETAIL OF SMALL OBJECTS. 
  FEATURES SUCH AS ISO, EXPOSURE COMPENSATION, AND SHOOTING MODE ARE NOW TRADITIONALLY SET USING CONVENIENT DIALS INSTEAD OF CUMBERSOME MENUS.
  USERS WITH LESS CRITICAL STANDARDS AND/OR LESS EXPERIENCE CAN USE A OR P WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS, BUT WILL FIND THEMSELVES SOON LEARNING AND UTILIZING THE ADVANCED FEATURES THIS GEM OF A CAMERA OFFERS.

<Content>What is cool about this is that I pre-ordered this item and Amazon delivered exactly on the 10/1/2008. Wow! Three weeks later they repriced this item lower and I immediately received the refund after contacted their service rep. What a service!

When I shopped for a point and shoot last Xmas I was looking for a form factor and boy it was a mistake. I bought a Lumix 10M pixel camera that even today I will not spend fifty bucks for it. That was a lesson learn.

What I like about this G10 is that now I can carry it every day to work and it takes great picture. Small enough to lug around and cheap enough to hide under a seat and let bang around in the car. I shoot mostly in the auto mode since most of my shots are candid and spontaneous. I own many canon pro L series lenses and a body so I got use to very good quality photos. This camera delivers consistent exposure though I think its red color spectrum is over saturated. It has plenty of shooting modes and manual controls that are very handy for pro-amateur users who have time to play with it. Its big live view screen is very handy especially when you do manual exposure. It came with a photo editor/import program that is smart enough to categorize photos on the day it was shot.

What I dont like about this camera is that it is very slow. If you are expecting that multi bursts like a DSLR can do then forget it. when shooting a movie you can zoom in or out but its autofocusing does not work and that mean totally ruin your movie. Of course that mean you zoom with your legs for it to work. and then the white vertical streak band on the left or right hand side of screen when you shoot a movie and if your camera is facing the sun light couple degree off. In the normal shot it also show but it will a be reddish glow like lens flare in final image. In the movie however it what you see is what you get. 

Aside from those annoying flaws I still think it is worth the money for a camera that takes great picture in any kind of lightings. If you buy this camera for pixel count then I think you can look for a cheaper model since I barely see any difference with more pixel. For any PS camera I think the lens is too small to gather all subjects details.

<Review>
<DocID>B001G5ZTPY-149</DocID>
<Content>I am what one may call a serious amateur photographer. My first serious camera was a WWII-vintage 35mm Leica rangefinder that my dad, while in the U.S. Army, got from a captured German Oberleutnant (he said he won it from him playing cards!). I still have that camera, though it needs work. My first modern SLR was a Canon F-1 I got back in the early 1980s. Wife Number One got that - along with all the lenses and accessories - in the divorce. Sniff! Sob!

At this stage in my life, I still care about the quality of pictures I take, but I no longer have the money or the desire to carry around a bulky DSLR body with a satchel full of lenses, flashes, filters, etc. Forgive me, O gods that guard the purity of the photographic arts - I want a point-and-shoot! But I dont want a toy, either.

My first choices would have been something like a Leica DLUX 4 10.1-megapixel Digital Still Camera or a maybe a Sigma DP1 14MP Digital Camera. Both - sorry to say - are a little too rich for my blood right now. That left me with plan B - either the Panasonic DMC-LX3K 10.1MP Digital Camera with 2.5x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) or the Canon Powershot G10 14.7MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom.

As much as I have liked Canon products in the past (I have owned Canon scanners and printers as well as cameras over the years and have always liked their products), I was highly suspicious of the Canon G10 on the grounds of its 14.7 Megapixel resolution. How much digital noise would I have to endure so Canon could claim victory in the latest skirmish of the megapixel wars? I was also very intrigued by the Panasonic for its lens - extremely fast for a point-and-shoot at f2.0 and its unusually wide angle of 24mm (35mm equivalent).

In the end I got the Canon G10 for the following reasons:

1. Most of my shooting is either portrait or outdoor scenery shots, where short to long telephoto (60mm-200mm equivalent) is most appropriate, so the extreme wide angle of the Panasonic was less useful to me. If you are someone who takes lots of family group shots in close quarters, you may feel differently, however.
 
2. The Canon, though with a slower lens than the Panasonic, was nevertheless able to pass my art museum test. In other words, I could take excellent hand-held shots indoors of art objects in available light at fairly low ISOs of well under 400, sometimes at nearly 200; shots clear enough to show the depth and detail of every brush stroke. I found that to be good enough for me. But if you are someone who likes to do available-light shots in candle light or outdoors around camp fires, the extra speed of the Panasonics lens may then become crucial.

3. The Panasonic, though admittedly an excellent camera of its type, was awkward to use, at least for me. It was a tad too small for comfort (I am a big guy, 64, 280 pounds, with hands like catchers mitts). The camera always felt on the verge of slipping out of my hands, especially when holding it in my left hand while messing with the controls with my right. And mess around I did, since the controls were not particularly intuitive in their operation. Im sure one could get used to just about anything, especially if one reads the manual and practices with it long enough. But I am of the school that believes that good interface design means NOT having to read the manual!

4. The Canon G10, in my opinion, just fits. Big enough and properly shaped for my hands to feel comfortable gripping, but just small enough for carrying in a coat or jacket pocket (though admittedly too big and heavy for a shirt pocket). Whats more, every major control is plainly marked and positioned right where God intended for it to be. I found that the Canon passed my users manual test as well. Only with the most obscure and least-often-used functions did I have to break out the damned book to figure out how they worked. The camera feels satisfyingly solid, with very good build quality; it just feels good in the hands. I found I felt comfortable with the camera very quickly, could take pictures right away, without hassling with learning the manufacturers perverse sense of control interface logic.

5. I found the image quality to be generally excellent, with great detail present and surprisingly low noise at ISOs below 400. Left to the cameras automatic white balance sensors, I found the color balance just a tad bit cool for my taste, but what do I know... Im an old Kodachrome guy. In any case, it is easy to set your own custom settings for color temperature to suit your preference. Even if forced to take shots at ISO 400 and above, all is not lost. For Photoshop users, I recommend PictureCodes Noise Ninja (http://www.picturecode.com/) plug-in. For users of The GIMP (excellent open source free photoshop alternative), try GREYCstoration (http://cimg.sourceforge.net/greycstoration/). Both of these software plug-ins do an excellent job of cleaning up noise without obvious objectionable artifacts. These tools enable shots at high ISO to be much more usable, unless you insist on those poster-sized blow-ups.

In sum, the Canons worst shortcoming, noise at high ISO (a problem with ANY digital point-and-shoot that sells for less than a grand), is more than outweighed by its sheer usability, its excellent feel, solid build quality and intuitive interface, as well as image quality good enough to satisfy just about anybody. I will step out here and say that on prints 11x13 and smaller, it would take a keen eye indeed to tell the difference between most images from a G10 and those from a DSLR selling for more than twice the price.

Whats more, the Canon G10 offers, for those who want to explore the deeper capabilities of the camera, a wide array of automatic shooting modes as well as excellent creative control options, including RAW image support (although Canons implementation is STILL proprietary and not yet natively supported in Photoshop), shutter or aperture priority, full manual exposure mode, and precise control not only of depth of field, but independent focus and exposure locks, too. This is an easy camera for a novice to just pick up and use, but is sufficiently advanced for the serious amateur or pro when he or she needs high quality with low bulk, and for that novice who wants to grow into his or her new hobby.

For a novice, this camera may seem a touch pricey, but at less than $500 is truly a steal compared to the prices of other high-end point-and-shoots to which the Canon G series is often compared.</Content>

<Content>MY MOVE FROM THE G7 to the G10.

I own and really like the Canon G7.  I passed on purchasing the G9, not seeing much that would attract me over the G7.  But as I read about the G10, I began to see enough new stuff to make it sound interesting to me. Little did I guess what a huge leap up this purchase was going to be.

Ill try to focus here on items you may not have read about in the reviews below, or at least items that may not have been covered in any detail.

Overall, the feel and build of the G10 is simply great.  Nothing about it feels flimsy or cheap to me.  It has a bigger grip on the right front where your fingers wrap around the camera and the camera is a delight to hold and use.

The LCD is now 3 of course, and much sharper and crisper than my G7. The G10 still uses my SD and SD HC (SD High Capacity) cards and I am happy about that.

I wanted to test the new I-Contrast feature I had been hearing about, so I sat my wife in the bay window with a fully sunlit window behind her. I took a series of photographs from several feet away, focusing (with face detect) on her face. 

With the test shots where I had I-Contrast turned off, her face was visible but pretty dark as were the interior walls around the window behind her. Not an unusable picture, but certainly not a good picture either. I was surprised they were as good as they were but I still wanted better than this. 

So I enabled I-Contrast and shot the same scene.  The results were a very pleasant surprise.  The outside scene through the window was still slightly overblown ... almost exactly as in the first series.  But my wifes face and the interior walls were now much more properly exposed and the pictures were truly usable ... something most of us would be happy to have taken. It was clear that I-Contrast really does work and since it is easy (using the camera menu) to engage I-Contrast I will certainly be using that feature often in contrasty scenes where I want to avoid harsh black shadows.

I was quite impressed with the quality of this new lens.  I thought I had a sharp crisp lens on my G7 but the lens on my G10 is a definite step up. Or maybe it is the additional pixels ... whatever, the difference is remarkable and was totally unexpected. 

I was a bit concerned about the loss of Optical zoom range from the zoom range available with my G7. I never used digital zoom on the G7 because it was too easy to lose picture quality and I didnt want to risk that. But I had read about a new feature of the G10 where it if you set the digital zoom to standard, the camera would combine Optical and Digital zoom and allow you to seamlessly use them together up to a point just shy of where picture degradation would begin. Then it would stop zooming. If you then tried to zoom some more, the G10 will allow that but you will then be digital zooming into the range where there is a risk of picture degradation.  All very clever I thought, but did it actually work?

I decided to test that.  I sat the camera on a block wall and shot the street sign across the intersection (about 150 feet).  As I expected, when I zoomed in the zoom ran seamlessly to what appeared to be maximum and stopped.  I took the picture.  Then I twisted the zoom button again and sure enough, the zoom continued zooming (into the possible degradation zone) to the true maximum zoom using not only all optical capability but ALL digital capability.

I fired up my computer and loaded the first shot ... the standard zoom.  Taken at 14.7 Mega Pixels, I was immediately stunned by the quality of the shot. It wasnt just good, it was simply flawless!   There was absolutely nothing about that shot that I wanted to improve except, perhaps, it still didnt bring the street sign all that close. So, using my photo editor, I just kept zooming in on the street sign until it virtually filled my monitor ... and the image was STILL FLAWLESS! I simply couldnt believe my eyes. Color was perfect, edges of the lettering were crisp and absolutely sharp.  There was nothing for me to improve in a photo editor. I was stunned. (I may have even laughed out loud). Even the leaves of the mesquite tree in my neighbors yard which is some 20 feet behind the sign were all visible and definable.  WOW! WOW! WOW! 

Then I loaded the next shot where I had zoomed the G10 out until it paused, then zoomed more to push the combination of Optical and Digital zoom to the absolute limit.   To keep it short:  It was about as good as I was used to getting from my G7 using Optical zoom only ... which is OK, but not truly sharp, crisp and the green color of the sign looked somewhat faded.  Also the tree leaves in the background were no longer distinct ... Again this is not a picture youd throw away by any means and one which could be improved with some work in Photoshop but even with that effort, it would be nothing near the quality I could get with the G10s method of combining Optical and just the right amount of Digital zoom.  And the G10 gave it to me without any additional effort whatsoever.  

My future approach to photography of distant objects in the future  was immediately obvious.  I will use the G10s built in magic (as I did in the first zoom shot) and then simply crop and enlarge the crop to the size I want for flawless, effortless results.  

As I said, I skipped the G9 so I cannot compare the G9 and the G10, but I couldnt be happier with my decision to upgrade my G7 to the G10.  The G10 clearly takes this type of photography to a new level with features, a great lens and picture quality.

For several years, I actually had a $6,500 setup including the Canon Mark II and some L glass lenses.  It was heavy, cumbersome and took pictures which, as expected, cried out for work in Photoshop. Professional cameras produce pictures that expect the photographer to work on them.  While I enjoyed fiddling with the pictures from the Mark II, I eventually tired of that weight, bulk and switching lenses so I gave the camera to my son. Now, that I have this G10, I will never look back. 

I guess I will need Photoshop again if I try to take pictures in the dark with the G10, it does have a bit more noise at higher ISOs. And if you are a true pro, you will probably rant and rave about noise at higher ISOs I suppose.  

For the rest of us, the pictures up to ISO 400 are quite acceptable and if are really picky, noise removal is simple enough to accomplish with Photoshop or any other software capable of noise reduction.  In real life, I guess I dont shoot much where I use ISOs beyond 400 anyway. 

I have owned cameras all my life and I have never owned a camera I liked more than this G10, or from which I got better pictures right out of the camera than this G10. This camera is Worth every penny to me.

<Content>Most of the criticisms in other reviews relate to high noise over ISO 200, and that is true.  But below 200 they are very good.  Luminous Landscape just posted a comparison of the $500 G10 against a $40,000 Hasselblad H2 with a 39 megapixel back and was amazed to find little observable difference in 13x19 prints.  8 professional photographers could not distinguish reliably between them.  That is a lot of performance for a camera the size of a cigarette pack and 1/80th the price of the other camera.

I like the controls.  ISO and over/under compensation are dials on top of the camera.  No more hunting through the menu to make those adjustments.  Image stabilization makes it possible to shoot at relatively low shutter speeds.  RAW and full manual controls make this a very versatile and easy to use camera.

I rarely shoot at ISO 400 or above so I dont think the noise at higher settings is a major flaw.  I previously used a Canon Proshot 1 that cost twice as much as the G10 and it only went up to ISO 400.  I suspect Canon included 800 and 1600 in case you had to use them but you will need them less because of image stabilization.

Overall a great camera to take traveling.

Update:

I just returned from a two week trip.  Along with the G10, which weighs nothing and fits in a jacket pocket, I took a Canon 1Ds III with a full set of lenses in a pack that weighed about 30 pounds.  Hauling the 1Ds around cities was just too much of a hassle so the G10 was the camera that got used except in instances where the big camera was with me or it was worth going back to take a shot I couldnt get with the G10.  That gave me a good comparison between the best camera Canon makes and the G10.

First, ignore all the people that found the cameras image quality inadeqate, especially the megapixel freaks.  I previously used a Canon Proshot 1 as a carry around camera.  It has 8 megapixels and an L quality lens that has about the same range as the G10.  The G10 produces a noticeably better image.  The color is dead on in multiple light conditions from bright sun to shadow to indoor under artifical light.  The quality is comparable to the 1Ds except when a wider lens was needed or light was very low.

The image stabilization is a big advantage.  Shots are amazingly clear and sharp.  The camera can be reliably hand held down to 1/15 and lower if care is taken.  I took one shot of an alter illuminated with artifical lights inside a dark church.  The shutter speed was 1/5 but by steadying the camera on the back of a bench I got shots the 1Ds could not surpass on a tripod.  What really amazed me was that the color was right on shooting in program mode and making no color adjustments on my own.  I also noticed that one shot was at ISO 100 while another was ISO 400.  I printed both to compare.  The 400 shot has noticeable grain in the shadow areas but the illuminated portions of the alter are very close to 100.  The camera also has a lot of exposure range.  Rarely was a shot unusable because either the highlights or shadows were blown.  

The lens is excellent.  Very sharp and free of flare, even with the sun in the frame.  The self contained lens cover is also helpful.  The cap on the Proshot 1 was prone to falling off if it brushed against someone in a crowd leaving the lens exposed for the rest of a trip.  I also really liked having the exposure compensation and ISO dials on the top of the camera.  That made it much easier to adjust for shots when needed without having to stop and work in the cameras menu.

In sum, this is a very good camera, especially for traveling.  It will not take very wide or long photos and shots are grainy at higher ISOs but cameras with fewer megapixels will not take better photos and the high ISOs combined with great IS and the ease of carrying it around makes it possible to get shots that would be impossible otherwise.

The battery is also very good.  I ended up taking about 350 photos with the G10.  The battery indicator showed full charge the whole time.

This camera has limits.  It was not built to be used for professional quality shots in a studio but it could probably be used for that purpose to an extent.  It has too much lag in setting up the shot to be used for sports or active children or pets.  It was never pitched as a camera that could do those things.  But it does take very good photos.  Better than any small camera I have ever used and equal to the best cameras in a broad range of conditions.

2/28/09  Third installment

A mea culpa is in order plus a drop to 4 or even three stars.  The camera is inconsistent.  It remains great for traveling and shooting without a flash.  I keep the 5 stars for that.  But shooting indoors with flash is poor bordering on unuseable.  Shots of my grandson are full of grain and lack detail.  They remind me of shooting 400 asa print film with a mediocre point and shoot camera.  The camera is also slow to shoot and slower to recover and shoot again.  Shots under similar conditions with my 1Ds III are stunningly clear and I can shoot five or six shots quickly in succession.  With the G10, I get one shot and have to wait several seconds before I can take the next shot.  The G10 is simply not useable for indoor flash.

It is strange that the camera can be so good in natural light without a flash and so bad with the flash.  It is not the settings because I have tried it in auto and AV at ISO 80.  </Content>

<Content>There is a MIX of customer reviews here and I fully understand some of the frustration and yet I cant help but wonder if some of the reviews are also PLANTS.

Ive used my Canon G10 for just over two weeks now.  Thus, I am not an expert and I certainly do not shoot for or claim such as a profession.  I travel for a living and I love photography; especially taken of the adventures I so blessed with.

I have had several of Canons EOS line SLRs.  They are excellent cameras and while Ive also had both Nikon and Sony cameras as well, nothing has come close to the Canon line.  They simply excel in digital imaging.

The G10 is built like a tank.  Ultra rugged and strong.  No plastics here.

I found its colors exceeding the quality of my Canon 50D.  Even when I used Canon USM IS lenses.  I received slight BLUR from my 50D last weekend when my wife and I decided to take some 300-400 pictures of the Napa Valleys Fall colors.

She used the Canon G10 and I used the Canon 50D.  Her colors, her sharpness and her black of blur or backlit situations was stunning for what is essentially a POINT  SHOOT camera.  

Keep in mind this camera runs a simple $499.  With a superior optical system, excessive megapixel range and a shutter as fast as one could ever hope for.  The camera is ready always for that next shot.

Battery life was very good.  Charging time fast.  The entire fit overall for the camera could not be better.  I told my wife the Canon G10 was indeed the BMWs of camera performance for that style or type of camera.

Personally I think its underpriced.  More so, this is a POINT  SHOOT.  High-end of course but still a POINT  SHOOT.

This was and is an excellent choice.  Built in Japan (not China) for quality and small enough to carry around without the weight or size of a SLR.

I needed to replace my PS camera and after doing a lot of reading I narrowed it down to the Lumix Z28 and the Cannon G10 and SX10IS (since I could not get my hands on a Cannon SX1IS).  I use a Nikon DSLR for most Important things but It is too bulky when I travel or vacation and also my wife finds it hard to use. I also wanted to be able to shoot video that was at least decent so I would only have to lug around one camera so it was a must to be able to zoom while shooting video as well.

My first choice was the Pannisonic FZ28, it seemed to have everything I was looking for however, after one day of shooting it was obvious that there were some major problems such as CONSTANTLY WONDERING AF WHILE SHOOTING VIDEO, INABILITY TO TRACK FOCUS WHILE SHOOTING VIDEO, WASHED OUT SHOTS (stills) and a few other operational and menu issues that were unacceptable.  

That left the two Cannon cameras.  I chose the SX10IS over the G10 due to the fact that the G10 WILL ONLY DO A DIGITAL ZOOM WHILE SHOOTING VIDEO Yes, The optical zoom does not work for video.  I see this as a deal breaker for me since digital zooms add far too much noise to the immage to be usable.  Plus, the added focal length, cost diff. and articulated VF on the SX10IS influenced me as well.  Too bad about the G10 since I really want to like it.  Only down side to the SX10IS is no ability to do RAW format.  Hope there will be a hack to fix that in the future.   </Content>

<Content>I am a photo enthusiast, and primarily use a 40D.  I love the camera, but it is not always practical to carry around.  I also have used several compact cameras that are very easy to carry around, but arent good for much more than a snapshot.  I wanted something that was portable enough to take to things like the state fair or a party at a friends, while also providing great pictures.

This camera is perfect for that.  Ive had the camera about a week and shot 250 photos or so, mainly test shots to see how the camera performs in various scenarios, as well as to just learn my way around the camera.

The photo quality is very good.  Not DSLR good, but that is to be expected.  

I feel that the camera takes pretty usable pictures up to ISO 400, but if you plan on making very large prints (above an 8X10) it may be better to stay below ISO 200.

I wish the camera had fewer megapixels and better ISO performance, but no camera is perfect.

I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a portable high quality Point  Shoot camera.</Content>

<Content>I had high hopes that the G10 would be vastly improved over the 1 year old G9.  The wider lens and improved monitor are big pluses but cramping yet more pixels into that tiny chip didnt help matters at all in the image quality department.  Besides the high noise levels above 200 ISO the lens doesnt stops down further than f8. Mine got returned.  

At this price point I think many would-be G10 buyers may be better off considering a Nikon d40, or similar small Canon.  Yes these are  larger cameras, but only slightly, and the gain in image quality is far superior.</Content>

<Content>Im a hobbyist who long ago owned a Konica SLR and shot lots of slides.  In the digital age, Ive only owned point-and-shoot cameras and have become frustrated by their lack of flexibility and quality.  I looked long and hard at SLRs but dont yet feel I can spring for the price.  I also wanted something more easily portable.  But I wanted complete control over shutter speed and aperture, and I wanted to be able to shoot in RAW for more post-processing flexibility.  I decided to spring for the G10.

Since purchasing  this camera about a week ago, Ive taken about 2,000 shots. (I went a little nuts!)  Heres what Ive learned so far:

-- Although the auto settings produced very good pictures, this camera really comes into its own when you shoot in Manual mode.  I was able to routinely get some vivid fall sunset scenes on a lake with beautifully saturated color and contrast by tweaking shutter speed and aperture settings separately.  

-- Id say that the noise at 400+ without post-tweaking is considerable, though nowhere near what I used to see on 400 ISO film back in the day.  It was easily reduced post-processing using a noise-reduction program that works within Photoshop, and I ended up with some beautiful indoor shots with minimal effort.   I even took some night landscape pictures with a bright moon at 1600, and was pleasantly surprised at the results after tweaking them afterward.  

-- I was able to get extremely sharp photos in macro mode (closeups of bees in flowers, that kind of thing), again without a tripod.  Im still getting the hang of focusing on the exact part of the flower that I want; I find it more cumbersome to do it with this camera than I did with my old SLR (where you just turned the lens with your hand).  

-- The camera did a good job out of the box at face recognition.  The built-in flash on auto settings was just OK; it didnt hideously over-expose the faces, but it didnt look entirely natural either.  Again, moving away from the auto settings and using fill flash judiciously helped me create some much more natural and attractive portraits. I would imagine adding a separate flash attachment would help even more.  I found my favorite portraits were taken with no flash at all and some light tweaking with contrast in Photoshop.  

-- The optical zoom met my needs well.  I loved having the wide-angle capability for landscape shots, and I got some gorgeous, very clear pictures of a bald eagle at the top of a tree with the telephoto zoom.   The camera clearly showed me when I was moving beyond the optical zoom into digital zoom, and my pictures of the eagle deteriorated accordingly.  I will probably turn off the digital zoom.  

-- The camera comes with all kinds of built-in scene settings (snow, night snapshots, sunsets, underwater, etc.), most of which I havent yet found that helpful.  I did get a couple of fun foliage shots using the sunset and foliage settings, but in both cases I couldve gotten the same results simply tweaking in Photoshop afterward.  If you dont want to mess with post-processing programs or playing with the cameras controls, I could see how these scene settings could be useful.  

-- Photoshop CS3 cant open the RAW files from this camera yet.  This is a big drawback for my purposes.  I have opened the RAW files in the Canon software that comes with the camera, but its not nearly as powerful or intuitive as Photoshop.  So for now, Im exporting the RAW files to Photoshop as TIFFs, and theyre enormous -- 85 MG.  The quality is marvelous, however, and Im hoping that Adobe will quickly add support for the G10.

Ill try to add some photo examples to this review.  I noticed they get a little washed out when saved for the web; the originals are much more vivid.

As point-and-shoots go, this is about as good as it gets for my purposes.  I gave it five stars, though Id like to give it a half-star demerit for the lack of RAW support in Photoshop (a problem I hope will soon be corrected).  If youre not quite ready for the leap to an SLR but you want more control and quality than the common point-and-shoot camera, this is an outstanding choice.</Content>

<Content>Ask yourself why you want a new camera and that will help you decide if the G10 is for you. Me, I was looking for a replacement for an older PS. Grandma photos. Walkabout photos. Textures and ideas for my quilts. The occasional WOW! shot. I want to tuck it in my purse or belt pack and keep it with me at all times, as I have with various PS digitals for over a decade. Anything more, I can haul out the 35mm Canon EOS system I used when shooting motorsports. (Alas, that spends most of the year in the very heavy camera bag loaded with all the stuff one tends to acquire with a SLR. Not convenient to haul around except for special occasions.)

I bought my G10 three days after it was released and have taken several hundred shots with it since under many different conditions. Its a bit on the heavy side but the construction is very solid. The neck strap is a bit short for the way I prefer to carry my cameras (across my shoulder/chest) but thats easily fixed with an aftermarket strap. A Lowepro Edit 100 case works well and has space for my cell and ID so Im not unduly encumbered when out hiking.

Leave the camera set on Auto and you can shoot excellent photo after excellent photo (assuming you know the basics of composition and photography). If you decide to take more control, its easy to do.

This camera has one huge advantage over a DSLR -- youll carry it with you and when you do youll take photographs. What could be better than that?

My last top-of-the line PS was a Nikon. It met my needs for three years. If this does the same Ill be thrilled.

Bottom line: know what you want in a camera before you buy one!

<Content>I have used point and shoot cameras for their size and convenience, as I am always on the go.  Most recent camera has been Canon SD800IS - a great camera for spontaneous shots.  My needs are growing and photo editing is becoming a more important element of making photos effective.  The JPEG files that cameras output, like my Canon SD800IS, look fine, however, because the camera has already processed its RAW info in making the JPEG, the options left for photo editing afterward are limited.  

The Canon G10 was my choice for moving to a more advanced camera with RAW file output, higher quality optics, and without the bulk of the Digital SLRs.  There are other cameras that compete with the G10 - Given all the pros and cons I decided on the G10 based on its feature set and positive Canon G9 reviews.

My experience with the Canon G10 (acquired Oct 8, 2008)
+  Images on auto settings have been far superior to my SD800IS
+  Menu and settings are easier than my SD800IS
+  Startup time for first shot is fast - similar to what I enjoyed with my SD800IS
+  Construction quality and feel of the camera is solid (but doubles the weight)
+  The lens has an automatic self covering protector - not shown in most web photos
-   Canon registration via web is missing option for G10 cameras
-   Canon G10 cases (listed on their website  camera manual) not available for sale
-   Canon RAW lacks support for Photoshop and Aperture
-   Canons software can convert their RAW to TIFF, but 15 MB files will grow to 83 MB

Overall, Canons G10 will be an excellent camera 
+ small enough to keep in my briefcase or carry around for spontaneous opportunities
+ powerful enough to capture high quality images. 

When Canon provides more flexible support for RAW (or I learn other ways to get their files into Photoshop and Aperture), Ill probably give the G10 5 stars.</Content>

<Content>shot with G10 all afternoon. I have the canon 5d and 20d and 30d, so was looking for a more portable camera that shoots raw. the detail at iso 80 is quite good. I agree with other posts that above iso 400 isnt the greatest unless you work on noise reduction later.  The Lumix 3 looks much better. I really like the range though, 28-140. The depth of field using the small lens/sensor, ie 6mm focal distance for the 28mm field of view, make the Dof quite good at f5.6 of f8 (f8 is fully closed down). I plan to use it for landscapes with a tripod, and suspect it will work well. (see Darwin Wiggett and his G9 landscapes). It also has a 3 stop ND (neutral density) filter setting to help blur water or clouds in scenes, as well as a nifty panostitching feature that makes it easy to overlap, line up, and lock up exposure and WB settings for the pano, so it merges later in software easily.

I also like the Custom 1 and custom 2 dial settings, to quickly go to your favorite settings.

Nitpicks: i wish the grip was more rubberized, and easier to grip.
The viewfinder is tiny, especially for me with glasses, so I will likely just use the LCD.</Content>

<Content>I was quite nervous about the G10. I would have hoped Canon would keep the resolution (megapixels) low in order to decrease noise, and when I saw the 15MP resolution, I assumed the photos would be sub-par. Nevertheless, I needed a full-manual compact camera and took the plunge. 

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the G10s performance. Indeed, the image quality is not the same as the shots from my 40D (digital SLR), but it is very good. The images are clear, sharp and vibrant. There is only minimal artifacting and noise at ISO 80 - 200. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I think ISO400 is fine for everyday shots. ISO800 is fairly noisy, and 1600 is a last resort setting. (But, make no mistake, the image quality at these settings is as good or better than all other compacts Ive seen, including my Fuji F31fd, which is legendary for good low-light performance.)

If you are looking for an advanced point-and-shoot camera, I believe you wont find a better one than the G10. There are a few very expensive ($1000+) rangefinder and APS sensor compacts, but I havent tried them.

One last thing to keep in mind when judging this camera. Because of the high resolution, the noise is going to be finer and more subtle when you look at an overall image. If you zoom in to 100% resolution on a 7MP photo, you are seeing twice the image area as when you zoom in to 100% on a 15MP photo. If you want to compare the G10s image quality to that of other cameras, make sure you zoom both images to the same size, and not just to 100%. Only then can you make an accurate comparison of the image quality.</Content>

<Content>If youre in the market for a general purpose advanced point and shoot digital camera, try this one for size.  

- The controls are nicely laid out - all the things you need to compose your shot (exposure settings, macro/normal button, flash on/off etc) are all readily accessible on the right side of the camera body
- Its lightweight yet feels sturdy
- It lends itself well to accessories such as teleconverters, external flash units, and even a waterproof shell
- The LCD screen is huge and bright and contains plenty of useful information like (for example) a live histogram, exposure settings, gridlines to help you shoot straight, and even an exposure meter when shooting fully manual
- At 28mm wide you can get a big group of people into the shot quite easily
- Theres plenty of shooting options that will cover most needs

I gave the G10 4 stars because Im being nitpicky:

- When shooting through the viewfinder, there is no info at all about your exposure setting, number of shots, battery life, etc.  Nothing.  Just the view.  (I do like how the image magnifies accordingly when you zoom)
- The aperture opens up only to 2.8 and closes down only to 8.0, when shooting full manual mode.
- And sadly yes, there is a fair amount of pixel noise when shooting in low light without either a flash or tripod.  This could be a problem for those of us who have been scolded for popping off flashes where we shouldnt.

I did not expect this camera to rise to the level of a high quality film SLR or DSLR.  When I bought it I was in the market for a good street photography camera - something light and surreptitious enough to photograph unique things I would come across in my daily romps in the city.  Something that I could tweak a bit instead of relying on the cameras preset exposures.

For that use the Powershot G10 suits me just fine - even exceeding my expectations at certain levels.  Its worth a try.</Content>

<Content>DOES NOT LIVE UP TO HYPE AT ALL...so far.

THIS IS A GREAT CAMERA... IF YOUR FAMILY VACATION PLANS ARE A TRIP TO THE CENTER OF THE SUN.......other than that it is a very very noisy low light camera.

So I agree with the other reviewer, if you are a bright light outside type, then get it,..... no problems there...nice!!!

If you bought into the low light DITCH-IT 4 processor hype, then it is a real let down.

My old 1 megapixel powershot (8 years old) did just as well, in the low light noise area...with zero image stabilization.

I will do some more tests, but so far this camera is a major let down.

Requires a lot of light, and looks like it has the RAW measles above ISO 200. 

Honest, wait for more reviews to come in, by the way, I have a Rebel, an XTI, and an XSI as well. Also 4 other Canon Digitals, I am (was) a Canon fan, and thought this would be a breakthrough product...but it wasnt.

Simply cannot deliver on the hype.

Unless someone can get a better handle on the low light noise settings, it wouldnt take a Nostradamus to predict this camera will get yanked faster than the G9.

As usual if you try to compesate with one board flash, it has the Frankensteins lighted lightning labratory garish effect.

I dont really shoot JPEGS much so I dont know about those yet.
Pretty much shoot raw. XSI was less noisy in raw mode.

I really had hoped this would be the first practical digital do all art museum camera. I will try some more tests at the Detroit Art Institute on all types of light and media, but for now any hopes I might have had are shattered.

If you do have good indoor lighting at ISO 100 and 200 under good  light the color is wonderful very nice pictures. In most museums  they wont let you use flash, same with other artsy places. Wide angle is nice great museum camera from that perspective......but low light and Image stabilization are a must.....

<Content>Its important to understand this camera within context: This isnt a digital SLR replacement or a pocket d-SLR. This is an excellent camera for someone who is a dSLR shooter as a backup, or even someone wanting to graduate from a point and shoot to allow them more control over the camera.

The Powershot G10 incorporates a few new features over its predecessor, the G9. It loses its 6x optical zoom down to 5x optical zoom, but packs 14.7 megapixels, features a wide-angle zoom compared to the G9, and uses Canons new Digic IV processing engine. 

The Pros:
* RAW capture. RAW photos dont feature any of the conversions that JPGs do, but also takes up a lot more space. Your typical RAW photo out of this camera will be 15MB, versus 4MB for a high quality JPG. Its nice having this flexibility.
* Supports Canons Speedlite external flash units. 
* Manual controls over aperture and shutter speed for additional controls. This is the single biggest advantage to the G10: if you have a SLR of any type, youre used to changing f-stops, shutter speed and other things on the fly to take better and more creative photos. 
* Shoots VGA video. I would have like to have seen 720p video myself.


The cons:
* Expensive spare batteries. $70? Seriously, thats insane.
* Early adopters will find out that Adobe products (Lightroom, Photoshop) and Apple Aperture wont support the G10s RAW - yet. *fingers crossed* You can use the included Canon software, which I find unweildy and a pain to deal with.

I do recommend picking up a 4gb SDHC card, such as a Kingston or Sandisk. Class 6 cards are recommended to handle those large files that youll be shooting. Also, this wont fit in most camera pouches (I couldnt get it to fit in any of the Lowepro pouches without me feeling like Im smushing it in there) so youre better off going to a camera store and trying them out.

In the few days that Ive had this camera, I feel happy for having it, and it definitely feels like a more adult camera than my previous Powershots (not to say that they werent any good, its just that Ive gotten to the point as a photographer where I *need* the flexibility that this camera can provide.) If youre looking at making the jump to something more advanced, then give this camera a try. You wont regret it.</Content>

I bought the G10 in the hopes that Canons use of the Digic IV processor would yield low noise images. I was wrong. The noise starts to ruin the photos at levels of ISO 200 and above. Thats not acceptable in todays camera market. Unless you plan to shoot outdoors in bright conditions all the time, dont bother with this camera. The ergonomics are good and the build quality is top notch, but the imager is just not up to the job. Perhaps someday the megapixel race will end and manufacturers will go back to 6 or 7 megapixels with super-low noise at high ISO. They would do us all a favor if they moved in this direction. I did not own a G9 so I cant compare them.

I returned the camera the same day it arrived after shooting test images in RAW format, giving the camera the best possible chance of pleasing.

It is possible to have great image quality in a pocket camera. Just look at the Sigma DP-1.

Since first writing this review, I did similar tests on the new Leica D-Lux4 (similar to the Panasonic LX3) and the performance of this camera was great up to and including ISO800. The Leica is more expensive ($849) but the Panasonic is about the same price as the Canon G10.</Content>

<Content>I had the previous version of this camera a couple of years ago and took thousands of photos with it in all kinds of situations... sunsets in Bali, fireworks on the 4th, dim light in theaters, friends in bars, even product shots with specific lighting for work. This new version is everything that one was and more. I love it. I have a lot of friends who are photographers and and they are consistently surprised at the quality of images I am getting with a $300 camera. Its a whole world of difference from the standard pocket size most people carry around these days, and its really easy to use. </Content>

<Content>I want everyone to know that Panasonic, Apple and Amazon have not worked out the widget bugs necessary to process RAW files with the Panasonic DMC-FZ28 and quite a number of other Panasonic cameras on Apple computers.

Although you will see Mac markings/logos this DOES NOT mean the product will work with Apple computers to process RAW files that you shoot with it. DO NOT BUY! I was very unhappy to find this out after the fact! </Content>

<Content>Great camera, I was recently at an outdoor Rock Festival and took some really good pictures. Still learning how to use manuel settings.  I researched online how to shoot bands onstage at night and came out with good results.  This camera is great for both beginner and novice users.  My only con is the color sometimes can be a little off compared with a Cannon DSLR.  But you can tweak it in Photoshop especially with the ability to take raw photos. I am in the printing business so I probably am a little pickier than most.  Also another pro is the zoom.  I have only had this camera about a month and so far it is the best digital point and shoot I have owned over the past nine years.  I paid $80 more for my 3x zoom Kodak back then.  I am giving it 4 stars only because of the color issue which over all is not bad on a scale 1 to 10 I give the color an 8 compared to the Cannon.  </Content>

<Content>Ive been a Canon loyalist for a very long time. My Canon Powershot S2 finally died on me a few months ago, and it was time to find a replacement. I was leaning heavily towards the newest version of the S2, the SX10IS - 20x optical zoom! However, at the time I was ready to purchase, it was out of stock at most places, and it was going for close to $400, which was more than I wanted to spend. After doing some more research on the internetz, I came across the Panasonic FZ28. The more I read about it, the more I was impressed. 18x optical zoom, HD video, burst mode, not too heavy or large in size, which was a big one for me. Being the father of young kids, I dont want to have to lug around a full-size dSLR with me. This type of bridge camera is perfect for my day to day use. Plus, at $250, the price was a lot less than the SX10IS, making it much more attractive as well. Ive now had it for close to a month now, and will list the things that I like and dont like about this camera -

Likes:
1. Lightweight - the Canon S series cameras are heavy due to the fact that the use 4 AA batteries. My wife, who has been using the FZ28 a lot, loves how light it is. 
2. Battery life - even though it is a proprietary battery, it lasts a very long time between charges. The on-screen battery life indicator is pretty accurate as well.
3. HD Video - I love HD video! Yes, it does use up a lot of memory, but the quality is pretty stunning. 720p at 30 frames per second is very nice. Just make sure your computer is able to handle playing it back. The Canon SX10IS only has VGA video.
4. Picture quality - no complaints here. Photos are sharp and colors are good.

Dislikes:
1. No swivel out screen - this is one thing I miss from the Canon S series days, the nice swivel out screen. While I havent found myself in situations where I would need it yet, I am sure it will happen someday. Still, its not necessarily a dealbreaker
2. No dedicated video record button - this is something the Canon S series also had. A button that was dedicated to use for 1 push video recording. On the FZ28, you have to set the dial to video, and then click the shutter button to start recording.
3. Mono video recording - I do miss the stereo sound recording ability from the Canon. Some reviews Ive read have a major problem with the sound quality of video on the FZ28. Sound is clear and audible to me, just mono. :(

Hope this helps make someones decision a bit easier. There is no perfect camera (yet), but this one has done a good job filling in for now, until that perfect one decides to arrive sometime in the near future!

<Content>This is a super easy to use camera with lots of extra features.  The video setting is great and takes really good short videos. I used it to video a swim meet recently, then converted the files to a DVD and the quality was outstanding. 

The camera has settings for night, dusk, portrait, landscapes, etc, or you can use the automatic feature and the camera will pick the best setting for you. 

Pictures are clear and crisp. Its easy to use the flash and charging the battery is very simple. 

This is our second camera like this. I would recommend it highly as a good easy to use digital camera that takes quality photos and videos.</Content>

<Content>ORDERING  SHIPPING PROCESS: 

I ordered the Panasonic fz28($255) about 3 weeks ago and never received it(Im assuming it was stolen) so after some waiting Amazon sent a replacement with 1 day shipping through UPS. The first order was sent through Fed Ex  USPS and this information about FedEx is not available online through Amazon tracking.  It seems that Fed Ex initially handles part of the shipping aspect and then transfers it to USPS for delivery. 


INITIAL THOUGHTS OF THE FZ28:

1.) Ive waited since the release and finally purchased even after comparing this to the Canon SX10 IS. 

2.) The fz28 is not as small as i expected.  After watching numerous online reviews and videos i was under the assumption that this was somewhat smaller than it actually is.  This is not a problem for me, but can be for someone who wants a P  S camera that fits in their pocket.

3.) Its lightweight and has a plastic body, but does not feel cheap in any way. Also, its constructed very well and the buttons are logically placed. 

4.) The zoom button is the opposite of what i was used it.  To zoom in you turn the button to the right, unlike to the left some of the other cameras Ive used.

5.) Make sure to take off the lens cap because the lens does extend outwards when you turn the camera on.  This happened the first time i used it and can be an issue in the future.  Currently, Ive switched to a clear UV filter which helps protect the lens from scratches and dust.  I havent tested it for reduction in glare yet, but the filter was purchased primarily to protect the lens.

6.) Battery(rechargeable) life is very good, but i bought a spare one from amazon just in case.  Also, the fz28 uses an external battery charger and can not be charged directly though the camera.  Make sure to charge the battery when you receive it because it doesnt come pre- charged.  Recharge time is about 2 hrs.

7.) Very strong flash, but can be adjusted depending of the shooting conditions.  Its strong enough to effectively illuminate a large room(20x20 or larger?)


PICTURE AND VIDEO QUALITY: 

The picture and video qualities are outstanding for PS camera.  

1.) Personally, manual mode provides the best picture quality(especially when using zoom).  Using this, you can adjust aperture and shutter speed to suit your needs.  Also, i use IISO(Intellgent ISO)in manual mode(adjusted in menu) which is effective in most situations.  If your in a hurry and want to take quick shots then the IA(Intelligent Auto) mode would be a better option, but does not give you the best possible pic quality in low light shooting(if your not using flash and are using zoom).  If you can use flash for low light situations then its not an issue in IA, but this is limited to close range shooting.

2.) I was able to take several clear pics using the full 18x at 10mp without a tripod.  Although this was outside during the daytime.  For night time and low light shooting look at the previous section.  Just for reference, the degree of optical zoom can be increased by decreasing the mp.  For example, a reduction from 10pm to 5mp provides an increase from 18x to 25.7x.  Be aware that this variance does not make much of a difference. 

3.) I have not used Raw format but its available. The camera also comes with the necessary software to open and process RAW.

4.) Video quality on HD mode is amazing especially coming from a PS camera.  You can even use WVGA(844 X 480 i think) mode and it will still give you dvd like video quality.  Granted, its not the same as HD, but is a nice option in case you need to take longer clips.  I have an 8gb class 6 card which can hold about 40-50 mins HD video and 95-100 mins in WVGA.  The actually time will vary depending on the shooting conditions.  Personally, i will use WVGA for the time being until i purchase a 16gb or larger sdhc card. 

18x optical zoom is available during video mode, but is a little slow.  Also, there is a slight motor noise during zooming which can be heard on the videos if you really pay attention.  The noise is very faint and is not a major issue.  

5.) The sound quality is surprisingly quite good for a PS of this price range.  I already knew about the audio issues when it first came out, but since then Panasonic made an upgrade to the audio system.  The upgrade is only available for cameras manufactured after a certain date last year(i think Dec 08).      


ACCESSORIES I PURCHASED: 

Large Camera case(Ebay), Lenmar battery(Amazon), UV filter(Amazon),and 8gb  4gb SDHC class 6 memory cards.  Might be better to purchase 8gb or larger if your considering taking video(especially HD).  Also, its a good idea to purchase 2 or more memory cards due to their high defect rate. Make sure to backup all pics and vids to another source like a HD, DVD, or flash drive to prevent accidental loss. 


OVERALL:

Since Ive received the fz28, i have yet to be disappointed in any aspect.  In my perspective, this is the best camera on the market especially at the $250-300 price range.  For those who are considering this camera or are in the market for on, make sure to check the reviews and videos(youtube) to assess your needs before you make your decision.  I hope this review was at least somewhat helpful in guiding your decision.  I would like to say thanks to everyone who have written reviews on here and made videos(youtube) which helped me in my decision process.  Good luck

<Content>I am a very amateur photographer, but I wanted a camera that would give me good zooming capabilities and good pixel resolution - without having to spend the money for an SLR.  I found exacly what I was looing for in the Lumix FZ28.  It makes it easy to take great photos.  By great I mean photos that I like to come back and look at again and again.  If you are looking for a camera in the $250 - $300 range that will make you look like a better photgrapher than you really are - this is it.</Content>

<Content>As an inexperienced amateur photographer, a DSLR was a bit too large of an investment to make into something that Im unsure will become more than a simple hobby at this point. I was looking for something that took very nice digital images for both personal moments as well as artsy compositions. The option to shoot in RAW is a huge plus, and so far this camera has not disappointed me. Is not the greatest camera in low-light, but then again, what consumer level camera is? So far I have been impressed with the photos that I have been able to take even though I am still learning how to use the camera. I would recommend this camera to most anyone just picking up a photography habit.</Content>

<Content>This is too preliminary to count as a decent opinion -- unless youre digitally challenged and a product of a pre-analogue world, like me.  The product reviews made for selecting this a pretty easy choice.  However, this is my first camera purchase ever; but for those single-use things.  Truth be told, for someone who is challenged by their cell phone camera, my next step up should have been something smaller and simpler.  The How to Use Operating Instruction book is 125 pages long!!  This isnt point and shoot, by any means.  So, Im going to have to sit down -- just it and me -- and have a long heart-to-heart.  Im sure once I figure it out, this will be like the first time Bell transmitted a voice over a wire, in so far as Im concerned.  Those familiar with this product could do the digital equal to point and shoot; but thats not where Im at -- yet!</Content>

<Content>I was fortunate enough to order this camera when it was down to $249 for about 36 hours here on amazon. Like everyone else the Leica Lens will get my deepest rave reviews. The 18x optical zoom is unbelievable. The LCD screen is very bright and the resolution is very good. The auto focus is pretty quick except when major zooming occurs rapidly. The manual controls are a major plus and relatively easy to use and figure out. The movie mode is unreal. 1280x720 movies from a $250 camera that also has 18x optical zoom. It also feels really light in the hand and is easy to hold with just one hand.

This camera is truly an all in one. As a stand alone camera it excels. As a pseudo camcorder its quite good too. My camera included a note saying my model had the upgraded audio specs. If you read the online reviews a lot of people bang on the mono audio. Well the newest models are still mono but its actually decent IMO.

It was down to this camera and the Canon SX10 IS for me. I saved $100 by getting the Panny FZ28. I also got a bigger LCD, 720p movie mode and its much lighter than the Canon [FZ28 ~ 15oz vs SX10 IS ~ 22 oz]

The picture quality and zoom are second to none when considering size, ease of use, and cost. I can wear it around my neck all day turned on, snap pictures at will with no lenses to change or carry. The battery will last more than a day. Picture quality rivals that of cameras that cost three to four times the money.</Content>

<Content>I replaced an older digital camera with this FZ-28 (Minolta)primarily to digitize slides,many of them.It is fantastic,some of the slides are over 40yrs old and they look on the computer like I took them today!
I love this camera! however, the complexity of it and instructions can be some what intimidating. I relly think some of these camera companies creat devices that are more complicated than they need to be. 
I will likely not use 50-70 percent of this cameras capabilities.
If you want great pictures for a good price,buy this one on Amazon!

Great zoom, great vibration stability mechanism too.
Im so satisfied about this camera and for shure this is a great deal.
This camera stands between PS and SLRs camera, so if you think to go to a SLRs model and your experience is only about Point and Shoot cameras, FZ28 is a great bridge to take you to most advanced cameras on the market.</Content>

The camera is accurate in its native setting readings, light in weight, great lens, long zoom, and RAW capable (but you will have to go to software site to download correctly).
Camera takes fantastic pictures with great color reproduction. It is fairly easy to learn, and easy to use. Will take great sports pics, keeping up with the action.

<Content>I recently purchased the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28S because I was looking to upgrade from what I was currently using.  My previous camera was a 4 megapixel with 10X optical zoom.  There is an amazing difference in the detail that I see in my photos with the Panasonic.  I also like that the zoom acts quickly so there is no waiting on the camera to pull in the subject being photographed.  With dogs, by the time the previous camera would zoom completely, I would have missed the shot.  Not so with the Panasonic. User friendly, very lightweight, great size on LCD and good battery life. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking to upgrade from another digital camera. </Content>

<Content>Got this camera a week ago.  Use the proper software they give you to view images as you will notice that the windows preview function doesnt actually show any photos from any camera in their full glory (its optimised for speed) and this camera really does shine.

Essentially, it does great macro and telescopic photos with a lot of flexibility for the manual and program settings.  I feel I can take it anywhere and get a great shot in any situation.  Definitely superior image quality to any compact or ultra-compact, and better than most super-zoom cameras, but obviously still not quite SLR quality.  (Regardless, its amazing for the price.)  

Only minor gripe is that the Intelligent Auto setting only lets you record to JPEG and not RAW.  

This is not for people who want to just click and shoot without thinking.  Its a step up from that, but still far simpler than an SLR.  Anyone complaining about lousy indoor shots obviously hasnt tried using the very simple shutter-priority setting, that, or they havent tried playing with ISOs.  

Noise is fine until ISO 800.  At 800 you can get away with it if you turn up the built-in Noise Reduction on the camera (which is surprisingly good).  Dont know that Id ever use 1600.  

I highly recommend this camera for anyone who doesnt want the expense of a full SLR and doesnt want to have lug around a camera thats too large with a couple of lenses as well.  </Content>

<Content>First of all Im a Canon fan. I have had lots of Canon cameras including their Rebel XT DSLR. I was all set to buy the new Canon SX10. When I read the Canon reviews on Amazon, I kept seeing the Panasonic FZ28 mentioned a lot. I took a look at the FZ28 reviews and decided to take the chance on it. I never thought about cameras and Panasonic in the same category but I own two Panasonic DVD recorders and a Blu-Ray player and they are great. I am not going to bad mouth Canon as they are great cameras but I must say the Panasonic FZ28 really has impressed me. I like the looks, feel, weight and the well set up menus of this camera. I always thought Canon lenses were the best but this Leica lens is razor sharp and as good or better than Canons same class cameras. The hi-def pictures and video are outstanding and I purchased the optional component cable to hook up to my Hi-Def TV and WOW what a picture and video. Everything good about this camera has been covered already in other reviews here so I will only say its a ten star camera, five stars does not do it justice. Not everything is perfect for me. I wish I could assign video to the function button like I can with my Canon SD1000 and start shooting video instantly. It is somewhat inconvenient to turn the dial to video but not a big deal. The sound is OK on the videos but could be a little better. The joy stick controller is very easy to use and makes changing settings fast and easy. Everything works well on this camera and its all I could ever want, and as a photography hobbyist for over fifty years I like this camera better than anything Ive ever owned. This camera has a multitude of useful features and it gets my highest recommendation.

<Content>I have two other Panasonic cameras - a video camera and an earlier model digital camera and both were excellent values.  When I reviewed this camera I was impressed by the features Panasonic incorporated into this camera - long lense, vibration reduction, and view finder.  After using the camera for several weeks everything works as promised - sharp pictures with long range lens.  There are several minor changes I would make to the camera - the eyepiece should have a rubber pad for eyeglass wearers to avoid scratching your glasses and the viewfinder could be sharper.  If you use Adobe software it is imperative that you have the latest versions of Elements or Adobe Camera Raw to recognize the RW2 file format.  The Silkypix software included is very comprehensive and gives you all the features needed from beginner to advanced.  I would recommend they review the software manual and publish an Americanized version because their choice of words is sometimes confusing.  Overall an excellent value and would purchase again.</Content>

<Content>Camera has amazing capabilities, which Ive barely had a chance to explore yet. But love the compact size, easy to use controls, combination of high quality review screen AND good viewfiner. The zoom capability is awe-inspiring if the highest power zoom youre accustomed to is 200 or 300mm. Size of camera takes a little getting used to if youve been wrapping your hands around a regular sized SLR, as I had been, but you can adapt quickly to positioning your hands slightly different. And the size and weight mean I wont think twice about taking it virtually anywhere.</Content>

<Content>This is an impressive camera, starring a Leica 18x zoom lens coupled with intricate electronics.
I used SLRs for many years, but have been happily enticed to allegedly lesser cameras (this one  a shirt-pocket Canon), which are much handier to use  largely take fine to excellent photos.
Low-light photography, a serious bugaboo with digital photography, is being improved. This camera is remarkably good, even in the fully automatic settings, at taking excellent pictures in a very broad range of lighting conditions.
I bought several high speed memory cards for it, but one brand (Id rather not state its name) did not work  could not be made to work. My slow cheap ones did work. The Panasonic 8  16 GB cards work beautifully  hold enormous numbers of pix
plus movies (the latter soak up much memory  battery power, so have spares of both for long trips). The separate battery charger is a great accessory  was included; thus you can use the camera while recharging a spare battery.
Im very pleased with low-cost, high capacity batteries Ive also bought through Amazon. In all, an excellent camera with great versatility and fabulous zoom range.</Content>

<Content>  I got my FZ28 a week ago and have already taken hundreds of photos.  I am very pleased with it. It is easy to use and has excellent capabilities.
  I did weeks of research before deciding on the FZ28.  One thing gave me pause: negative reviews concerning the Electronic View Finder.  Since I MUCH prefer using an EVF over the LCD display, I was fearful. I ordered one because there were very few other negative things said about this camera, and it is an excellent value.
  My experience has been that the EVF is very usable.  It is bright and clear.  I wish it were bigger but I would still rate it as very good. I wear progressive bifocal glasses and have had no real issues using the EVF.
  I was a bit taken aback by the plastic body construction. However, I think the camera is very study and I LOVE the weight.  This camera doesnt feel like a hunk of lead hanging from your neck.
   Other positives are the use of SDHC memory (the 8gb Class 6 Transcend has been excellent), lightweight lithium battery that gives lots of shots (extras are easy to find and inexpensive -- I bought a very cheap one that works great), and quick accurate focusing (especially using the one area high speed option.)  The audio quality is not great, but is okay.
   Mostly though, this thing is just plain fun to use. It takes great pictures but is not dauntingly complex.  Experimenting with different settings is easy to do. You can use the fancy settings or keep it simple with the iA button. Above all else, believe me, the ultra zoom function is a delight.  I use it constantly.  You can take closeups of flowers while standing up, or capture images of a skittish woodchuck from a comfortable distance (for both you and the woodchuck), and take well framed shots of people from a non threatening range.  The ability to reduce the megapixel setting to increase the zoom is very easy to access and works extremely well.  Being able to zoom while shooting video is essential and this camera does it smoothly.  Stabilization works well, but can not perform miracles (a handle screwed into the tripod tap gives me some added stability.)
  I have enjoyed this camera immensely, but I HATE the fact that it has no remote shutter release mechanism.  This feature is simply essential for good tripod photography. Surely it can not be that expensive to incorporate into a design.  The self timer work around is a poor substitute for a feature that should be on every camera with a tripod receptacle. I have taken away one star for that glaring flaw.  But this is a great camera.</Content>

<Content>I have a Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ8 -- two models prior to the FZ28.  I read with great interest the glowing reviews of the FZ28 and decided almost immediately that I would get one because I absolutely LOVE the FZ8, and the FZ28 sounded like it had even more features.

Then one day I saw it in a store.  Much to my shock and horror, the second most important thing [the only thing MORE important is the quality of the lens, which is superb (apparently) on both cameras] that convinced me to buy my FZ8 was missing on the FZ28 -- the wonderful, huge, magnificent viewfinder.  

Yes, there is one on the FZ28, but its much smaller and more difficult to use than the one on the camera I already own.  For those of us with minor vision problems, having a truly usable viewfinder is EXTREMELY important!  

I hope they come out (soon) with another model with the advantages of the FZ28 but with a reinstated larger, easier to use viewfinder for those of us for whom that is important.  That I will buy in a heartbeat.</Content>

Many more features than I need but its not so complicated that I couldnt take a few photos within a couple of minutes without having to even crack open the manual.  The controls are laid out very logically and the camera is easy to hold and shoot.  The optical zoom is great and coupled with the digital zoom allows unbelievable closeups.  Changing megapixel settings if very fast and can be done easily using the Quick Menu thumb button while still looking through the viewfinder.  Im very impressed with the camera and I know Ill be more impressed as I use more features.</Content>

<Content>I had a Sony H3 and really liked it.  It was stolen from a hotel room and now after two years I was going to have to do research all over again.  Based on reviews from Amazon and dpreview.com I settled on the Panasonic FZ28S.  I have owned it for about a month and I am very happy with the purchase. The RAW feature was what made the final decision.  The pictures are great, good color and sharpness.  While I am no photo expert I really like the option of using the Raw feature and tweeking the final picture.  The iA auto feature is great for quick shots.  It produces very good results.  The camera is lite and easy to carry.  All around it is a wonderful camera at a very good price.</Content>

<Content>My other camera is a Canon 5D mark II (I kid you not).  5D2 will make you work for that admittedly amazing result.  FZ28 is more fun and a truly stunning all around camera.  I agree with about all the positives in the many reviews Ive read here, but dont see any suitable rants about the wonderful tele macro feature of the FZ28.  Like shooting bugs, flowers, rocks, stuff?  This is your camera.  At full 18x zoom it will focus at 3 feet with far greater depth of field than any other lens I know about.  Wow!!  Make that small stuff pop!  You dont have to decide which part of the tulip filling your shot should be sharp.  Shoot bumblebees and butterflies without scaring them off. Forget shoving your face and camera into the brambles or shredding your elbows and knees for that close up.  Just stand back and fire away.  Fantastic!!</Content>

<Content>I carefully researced this camera and was looking forward to receiving it since I wanted to take some high speed pictures of my greyhound.  Unfortunately, when I plugged the charger in to charge the battery, it wouldnt charge.  I contacted the company (Panasonic) and they told me that I would have to send it in for repairs.  I mean, really, this was a brand new camera.  I sent it in to the repair center (paid almost $14.00 to mail it in) and they sent me a letter asking me for permission to repair it.  I contacted the repair center and they said to ignore the letter which asked for payment to repair and said that I should receive the camera via mail.  I still havent received my new camera.  Disappointed.</Content>

<Content>This camera was purchased to replace a lost compact Canon 10MP camera.  Its not likely to get lost as this is slightly smaller and lighter than the old school 35MM SLRs.  I like the grip.  The only gripe I have is when taking indoor flash shots of people, you need to go to portrait mode and pre-select the type (indoor, outdoor, e.t.c.) using the joystick (its easy if you read the manual and play around with it a few times to get used to it), as shooting in the easy mode results in blurred subjects.  While this is no problem for me, it may take some first-time users a while to get used to all of the functions.  A big plus was the switchable viewfinder, and the easy short-cut buttons on the top for auto focus function and macro.  The battery life was good (400+ photos), and the night time exposure settings really show how sensitive this camera is.  I found the color a good flat, balanced, and consistant tone. (if you want more vivid or processed colors, use your picture software).  
In closing for the price, this ones a keeper! </Content>

<Content>I did months of research before choosing the Panasonic Lumix FZ28. I shoot a lot of architecture and nature, but Im not ready for a DSLR, so I went for a super zoom. This one keeps focus all the way out. 

The IA mode is great for most situations, but I cant wait to work with the dozens of other settings. One intriguing feature is the ability to shoot in RAW format. As I understand it, I can shoot in RAW, manipulate the picture in the accompanying software, and then save it in .jpg. Im going to experiment with that!

The camera is extremely light. Its easy to sling it over my shoulder as I walk. It doesnt feel plastic and cheap, like some have said. Its ready to shoot mere seconds after I turn it on, and the auto focus and hand-steadying features make it easy to use when I come across a great shot. 

In short, I love this camera so far. Im so glad I chose it. </Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera largely based on reviews here on Amazon. I am a complete novice when it comes to photography. My latest camera, before this one, was a Kodak V705 Easy Share. Its been a decent little camera for someone like me, except for the consistently poor indoor shots. Outdoor is usually quite nice. I always use the picture scenes because I do not have the patience to try and learn all of the intricate manual settings. Perhaps if I did, I could have gotten more from my Kodak.

As a result of my laziness, and because our daughter is getting married in Dec. in Maui, I wanted a really good quality point and shoot and was immediately drawn to the IA feature on the FZ28. The few pics Ive taken so far have been awesome! I decided to get this now as Ill have several months to learn more about it before the wedding (and no, I am definitely NOT the wedding photographer! I love my daughter too much to do that to her).

After price shopping, I ended up buying it at Vanns.com. They are (as of today) $40 less than Amazon or any other merchant. But Amazon had the best price on the 16 GB SDHC card that was recommended on here. 

I am now searching for the perfect case. The only extra I will have is a spare battery. But I want one that will hold everything (hood, cables, etc.) that came with the camera, including the quite confusing manual. Im looking at a DOLICA WB Series WB-3592 Case and a Case Logic medium slr. Any suggestions on that would be very welcome. I prefer to order online since we live almost an hour from any B  M stores (dont count Walmart; they have NOTHING).

There are 23 programs within the system, with additional variances within many of the sub-programs. I have not been able to test them all yet- too many. 

The camera is fast and accurate. Color reproduction is accurate. The camera is very light and fits naturally in the hand. There is an I or Intelligent mode; this is great for the beginner or anyone who wants complete automatic programming. Truly an excellent camera with a top rates lens.

Also, the zoom is phenomenal.  I can sit in the balcony at my kids schools and zoom in to their faces and the photos turn out as if I were taking the picture from right in front of them.

<Content>I am just a photographer want-a-be but I am amazed by the Panasonic DMC-FZ28.  I left off the k or s at the end because the cameras are the exact same (k-black body; s=silver) but when I bought mine the s was $10 cheaper -still is- and sold directly by Amazon (which offers free shipping and 30 days, no fuss returns-but you wont want to return it).  I paid $268 - now its $299 must be tied to the Dow Jones Average.

I have had the camera for only 1 week but the construction quality seems excellent.  The pictures are fantastic, far beyond what I had hoped for.  I have taken over 400 pictures from Macro to 128X zoom.  Stabilization, even without a tripod, is excellent.  
I am about to submit one photo to a local photo art show (Backus gallery -Fort Pierce, Fl) and I ran it through Photoshop for cropping and color correction.  When I saw the results that Photoshop offered I cancelled and went with the original.  

 There are many reviews of the FZ28 but the best overall was Camerlabs.com which has a video review on YouTube    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iJo0yAYcNA

Lightweight- but get the spare battery - battery life seems excellent but you will get carried away.

<Content>I got this camera as a replacement for my Canon S2IS.  I absolutely loved my Canon, but decided to try something new.  So far it has done an excellent job!  The auto mode comes out with great pictures, even in low light, and the LCD is beautiful.  The picture is taken immediately when you press the button down; very important when trying to photograph small children!  The body of the camera is easy to grip and all the buttons seem to be placed logically.  The burst mode is very accessible and Ive gotten some great action shots with it!  I do miss the convenience of AAs, but the proprietary battery seems to last well.  I like the software that comes with it for capturing and organizing pictures.
I have not tried recording video with it yet, or many of the other picture-taking modes.  So far it is shaping up to be just as nice as my Canon so Im going to have a lot of trouble someday deciding what brand to buy when I go to replace this one!</Content>

<Content>After using a simple point and shoot camera for years, I felt disatisfied with the overall quality of the pictures.  I was missing shots I shouldnt, and when I got the shot- the quality just wasnt there.  I did several months of research.  I wanted something that could do more  I thought I wanted a DSLR(Nikon d40).. but didnt want the cost of the lens, and was intimidated by the camera overall.  I really liked the canon sx10is, but it was just a tad bit too heavy, and at the higher end of what I wanted to spend (around 360-399) I thought I had settled on the Nikon p90; it was the shape, and feel that I wanted-  and has an amazing zoom.  But after reading the reviws, I felt that the indoor shot problem would not be resolved.(pictures often too dark around subject when using flash)  Many cameras are pinned up against the Canon previously mentioned; that camera is amazing.  If I can get the Canon Quality, for 100 bucks less I would be happy.  Welcome the Panasonic Lumix FZ28. This camera is simply AMAZING.  Go into any local big box shop and pick up the Nikon p90- it feels very similar to that camera, just a bit lighter.  

It of the box the Panasonic takes amazing pictures.  It has so many functions that I doubt I will ever know how to use them all.  And the most amazing thing about this camera, is you get the versatility of a DSLR, but the cost of a point and shoot!  You have the ability to shoot in RAW and modifiy pictures the way that you can with a DSLR.  I know that DSLR cameras are the best, but for someone like me who doesnt have the funds to dump into lens, but wants to take great pictures-  here is your camera.  

The only negatives I have found with this camera in the short time Ive owned it is getting used to removing the lens cap before powering up, and I have noticed a light line show up across the LCD when moving from a dark area to a very bright area to take a picture.  Im not sure if it is trying to adjust;  it has not shown up on the pictures.  I will be checking into that more. 

Overall this camera is JUST simply- Amazing!!  I could not be any happier with my purchase.  I dont know how anyone could be unhappy with this Amazing value.  Great job Panasonic!!! </Content>

<Content>I used to have a Panasonic FZ20 and I was so pleased with it, when it came time to upgrade I purchased the Panasonic FZ28S.  Whenever others see my photographs they immediately want to know what kind of camera I have.  It is easy to use and lighter than the FZ20. I researched many other brands and for the money and the quality of my pictures I cant imagine buying anything else. 

The pictures are clear enough for beautiful poster-sized enlargements.  I have close-ups of my children and flowers, etc., and people are constantly asking me if I am a professional photographer.  My son took a photograph I had taken to school and his teacher called to see if I would be the photographer at her daughters wedding.

I must mention that I have terrible eyesight and wear reading glasses.  This camera has both an EVF/LCD for viewing which works great, with an adjustment for eyesight clarity.

I highly recomend this camera on all aspects.

Enjoy!

<Content>I have had this for about two weeks now and have to say, it is an excellent camera!  The IA mode is awesome and the other modes are as well but you have to play around with them.  HD movies work pretty good but eat up the space on the SD card so be careful about them.  I would recommend getting some lens filters as I did because they make a noticeable difference (depending on the circumstance) in the pictures taken.

<Content>I may have had a faulty copy, but apart from the 3 or 4 great shots out of 200 that I took, there was very little to like about this camera. Focusing took a long time, portrait mode would arbitrarily decide if there was a person in the frame or not (even though my wife appeared in the same frame for minutes at a time, much to her frustration, as I kept trying to tell her that I was waiting for the camera to realize yes, person in frame.) I had to switch back and forth between iA and portrait mode, or focus the camera on the ground and then back at my wife just to get it to respond. Taking closeups of flowers using the special flower mode appeared straightforward, but reviewing on the computer showed that in 9 out of 10 shots the camera had focused on something else than it appeared when I took the shot.  Saving a single JPG to the card took longer than 2 seconds, I mean, its an inexpensive camera but still.

Overall, I wish the camera had performed the way others rave about it. The literally 3 or 4 great shots I got out of it are definitely very nice given the price point (I even got a shot of a helicopter in flight at full zoom that compares quite favorably to a similar shot I took with a $1,500 Canon 100-400mm zoom lens), but to get only so few percentage wise is just not worth the frustration and time spent. I have other P/S Panasonics and they perform great. I also have a Canon 40D and have been a photographer for many years. Now I needed something light but that still has lots of features and a good zoom, so I hoped the FZ28 would fit the bill - after extensively reviewing other the FZ28 came out on top because of the purported image quality and userfriendliness. Again, I may have had a faulty copy, but if you need to take a lot of people pictures, Id suggest you look elsewhere.</Content>

<Content>I compared many super-zooms and selected this camera based on many aspects, but the fact that it had a viewfinder in addition to the LCD screen was only a minor factor in my thinking.  Boy, was I wrong -- and lucky!!    I have taken hundreds of photos with it and now almost NEVER use the LCD when taking a shot.  Even though this viewfinder stikes some as modest (compared to full SLRs) I would not own a digital camera without one, especially a mega-zoom.  Even the best LCD screens are highly variable in their usefulness for composing shots under different lighting conditions (contrary to some advertising claims and some reviews), but the viewfinder always works and always gives you a good sense of what you will get with the shot.  The LCD on this camera is wonderful for reviewing pictures (if youre not out in bright sunlight) and is a strong feature of this model.  But do not be lulled into getting a camera with only an LCD just because the screen looks so bright in the store.  

I am delighted with the camera overall.  It is the ultimate travel camera:  very light and easy to carry all day, and with a lens with a range that can cover those massive landscapes all the way out to a peregrine falcon sitting on that cliff over there.  Image quality is remarkable for the price and weight.  Stabilization is also very good.</Content>

I was not satisfied with the typical point and shoot camera of 3 or 4X optical zoom, but at the same time I knew that an SLR camera would be way more than I needed.  So luckily my wife stumbled across this Panasonic camera and I was stoked about the specs and price.

As with most of the things that I purchase, I researched the large zoom PS cameras and for the price and specs, this is the best one out there.  Theres a Nikon that has 20X zoom, but this one seemed to fare better with the reviews out there.

One word of caution on this camera, though.  It does not use a standard mini-USB cable.  It uses the micro-USB cable.  So make certain not to lose the cable that is included with this camera.</Content>

<Content>A year ago I purchased a digital SLR with the intent of moving up a notch with my photography. The learning curve simply doesnt fit into the amount of time I can devote to developing my skills so it has spent most of its life in the camera bag. Well, the itch hit me again, but now the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28K came along and I have all I need in one compact package! In addition to the numerous obvious great features, I really appreciate the fact that the camera is much lighter in weight than my previous cameras. The grips are great, too. I am amazed by the great distance I can capture without the need for a tripod. I know I will look at the world differently now because my camera can easily zoom in and capture what was previously beyond my cameras reach.</Content>

<Content>I have compact 10X panasonic camera that I have used for over a year in a number of different situations with amazing results, particularly with the telephoto lens in a small camera.  I saw the great price for the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28S 10.1MP Digital Camera with 18x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver) and decided to upgrade, although it is not a compact camera.  When it arrived I was pleasantly surprised as to its relative smallness and fairly light weight compared to other cameras I have in my house, which are now gathering dust.

Just returned from Hawaii and used the camera for the first time. Amazing wide angle and telephoto lens with stabilization.  Pictures were sharp and with good colors.  Easy to use.  I mostly shot in the intelligence, automatic mode, and almost every shot came out perfect for me.  I was at Hana and arose before sunrise and took the camera to the shore and waited for the sun to rise.  As it did I took 18X and other angle shots using the automatic mode and sunset modes. Both gave me some dramatic sunrise shots with clouds in the background.  
The camera is light and small enough for me to easily take on hikes I normall take the compact camera.  It may be replacing the compact camera for many of my travels, however, I will probably take both since the compact is really great for placing in a pocket.
At this time I am very positive about the camera.</Content>

<Content>As a child, I would often borrow my fathers old Canon 35mm camera and fill many rolls worth of film. True, I was just goofing off and those rolls sat in my closet for years until they were no longer able to be processed, but it sparked something in me.

Years later, I would get my first digital camera: an Argus brand with a 2 megapixel limit. Then, a Canon Powershot A540 in 2006. I would steadily become more and more experienced, yet never quite serious enough to learn about things such as Aperture, ISO or even utility items like tripods.

This all changed in late 2008. With quite a bit of discretionary funding set aside, my interest in photography turned into a full-blown passion as I browsed the Camera  Photo section Amazon. I came across the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28K. While I was biased towards Canon cameras, I had read that the Lumix series of Panasonic cameras were worth consideration.

So, I purchased it in early January and didnt really get around to using it until February. I also purchased a polarizing filter to try out against sky-filled backgrounds, and both a monopod and tripod for stable shots.

---

After taking a couple hundred pictures with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28K, I can safely say this is one hell of a camera.

Being what is known as a bridge camera, the FZ28K combines the ease of use present in a point and shoot camera with the manual control present in more expensive models. For this, I am thankful: I can turn the dial to the well designed IA (Intelligent Auto) mode which will, given the surrounding light and motion of the camera, choose the optimum settings to take pictures with.

However, as I want to learn more, I can turn the dial further to access the Manual, Aperture or Exposure values and lower/raise them to my hearts content. In doing so, ive taken some good low light and night time pictures.

There are some pre-set modes you can select such as Scenery or Portrait if you dont want to fiddle around with the controls. In particular, I have been greatly enjoying the Macro setting as it allows me to take some very crisp up close shots and the Landscape setting to take wider shots of outdoor areas.

Along with the silver dial mode on top, the FZ28K has many standard options present in the current generation of cameras: black and white mode, histogram, color/light balance, and timer to name a few. Some have complained about the menus being hard to navigate, but after a few days worth of use, it becomes second nature.

In terms of construction, I am highly impressed. The FZ28K is larger than a point and shoot, yet smaller than a DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex camera). It just feels sizable in my hands without being too heavy or bulky to carry while taking many pictures on the go in a short span of time.

Included with the package is a battery (proprietary rechargable), battery charger, handy strap, lens cap, lens hood, audio/video cable, USB cable and software for editing pictures/creating panoramas. I suggest the Tamrac 5230 T30 Photo/Digital Camera Bag to carry the FZ28K in. Finally, get an LCD screen protector: the 2.7 inch wide screen on the back is surprisingly easy to bump into.

Do I recommend this camera? Absolutely. It is excellent for those in the beginner and intermediate states of learning about photography. And, from what I hear, has been well received by advanced users as well.</Content>

<Content>This is probably the best digital camera weve used thus far. We would rate it A+ in all of the usual (non-SLR) digital camera feature areas. Picture quality is extremely good. We tried prints 8x11 prints as well and they came out great. Low light shooting with flash also seems to work well (unlike with earlier Panasonic digital cameras).

We also love the HD video capability built into the camera. Since short video clips make a lot more sense (to me at least) instead of 60 minutes of a single event, this camera, along with a 16 GB Ultra II SD card, work really, really well for us. We were also very pleased with how good clips shot indoors, in the evenings, with ordinary household lighting looked on our Plasma TV. Be warned that the camera stores movie clips in .MOV format by default - which makes for some very large files. We use Any Video Converter (the free version) to convert files to AVI and other formats (180 MB .MOV clips become 1.5 MB AVI files). You can then email them easily to friends and family in addition to putting them on YouTube, etc.</Content>

<Content>Camera takes great photos in different lighting and scenery.  Its automatic, but camera can also be put in program mode. Music playing with slideshow was cool bonus. Before buying, I had read reviews claiming lowlight conditions are difficult, but the camera is much better than my Samsung Z73 and I expected low light (like night vision googles low light) photos to be a problem for most commercial cameras. But there is little or no blurring. If it is grainy, you can edit in Photoshop or Picasa.  In low light, best use the flash.  The flash is good. Camera adjusts when flash is used so it does not wash out subjects that are nearer or really white. </Content>

<Content>I needed a new camera after my good Sony died and my little pocket-sized point and shoot wasnt cutting it.  I was not going to spend a lot of money though.  As much as I like the dSLRs, I couldnt justify for my uses, the cost.  I have been a Sony fan because of the shot to shot speed and response time, the same reason I didnt care for Canons due to their slower response time.  I wasnt seeing a lot of great reviews for comparable Sonys however.  I found this Panasonic while researching and was skeptical to say the least.  I dont normally hear Panasonic in conversation about great cameras - tvs, stereos maybe, but not cameras.  The specs met my requirements - wider zoom, higher zoom, higher resolution, some manual control, rechargable batteries, and good flash.  But would the specs live up to expectations?  The reviews seemed to say so and I was willing to try it for the price.  

This camera has not disappointed me.  It is lighter than my old Sony and I dont have extra lenses to lug around.  The zoom, and the wide angle zoom, are both great!  At the highest zoom there can be some fringing but its minor.  We have 5 dogs, a couple of which are camera shy.  I needed a higher zoom to sneak pictures of them, and of course that has worked.  I have been able to get pics of them on the boat as its coming in without them noticing, out in the yard, etc.  Picture quality for me, both inside and outside, has been great.  3 of my dogs, and my indoor cat, are black - yet you can see individual hair detail in the pictures.  I will post some at some point.  

There are several choices of scene selections.  The menus and these selections took a little getting used to, but thats almost any camera when you change manufacturers.  The iAuto setting is perfect as a point and shoot, and my (non-technical) husband has no problem picking it up and taking pics on the fly.  

Battery life is great - because its sporadic and I tend to leave the camera on I havent checked how many pictures I can take on a battery.  I did however order an extra but not the Panasonic brand.  I tried the Lenmar and it has worked just fine with the camera.
Lenmar DLP006 Lithium-ion Digital Camera/Camcorder Battery Equivelent to the Panasonic CGR-S006A Battery

I am looking now at recommending another Panasonic, either this one or the TZ5, for a friend who needs a wider zoom to take house pictures of his work, needs something easy to use as hes new to digital, but doesnt have a ton of money to spend.  I am impressed with Panasonic, and they have a new convert in me!</Content>

<Content>Theres a lot to like about this camera. Ive had it a week now, and have decided to return it. Its not that the camera isnt capable. Its just that the few things it doesnt do well, matter a great deal in the kind of work I do. These might not matter to the majority of photographers; I often work in low light, macro and outdoor. A challenge for most cameras.

The first thing I noticed was that the LUMIX logo on the front of the camera is metallic. When taking low light photos under a soft spot, I observed that this meant that the text was reflecting back onto my subject! Doh! A piece of tissue stuffed over the logo helped, but its not a long term fix; youll have to paint over that metallic text. 

The zoom is useless, especially for macro work. Forget it. It just blurs the image. Likewise for all other conditions; it works fine for about 3/4 of its range, and at the maximum zoom, it loses all ability to focus, even in optimal conditions. Thats just silly. On the positive side, you *can* take some nice near macro shots. I got some very nice bee butts, but I did have to practically jam the camera right up against them to get the pictures. Brave me. 

White balance under fluorescent light becomes a distinctly green balance. Maybe I just didnt find the right adjustment, but in that case, it should have been easier to find. 

The camera ships with a lens hood and a camera bag, but the hood doesnt fit in the bag; you have to carry it separately. What the...?

The documentation is, well, Japanese. Not well written or organized, and too sketchy; chances are your questions arent answered in the doc. Theres enough there to get you started, but in general, count on figuring out the camera on your own. 

On the positive side, the glass is beautiful, the display nice and bright (and big), and the user interface, once you get the hang of it, is fairly intuitive. One annoying feature of the glass, though, is that if theres some schmutz on the lens, the display wont show it (unless its a thumb or a lens cap). Youll find it on your photos afterward. So check your lens and clean it often. 

Its also fairly light and easy to handle. I cant seem to be able to pick it up without putting a big ol fat fingerprint on the display, but that may be because Im a leftie, and this camera (like all cameras Ive ever found) is definitely designed for right handers. 

Image quality; reasonably crisp. Even with adjustments, I find the color to be a little off, but then, Im the pickiest of the ultra-pickiest when it comes to color matching. 

I got this camera because of a problem with the camera Id planned to use for shooting stills of a play (yes, I was hired to do this), and this was the best I could grab on the way to the job. Lumix has a good reputation for low light. Unfortunately, the lighting board at the theater blew out just before the performance, (it was a jinxed evening all the way around!) so the play was performed under (you guessed it) fluorescent house lights. Hello, Photoshop! (It was that or force the production to tell people that the play was about Orion slave girls or leprechauns. Everybody and everything looked green.)

Oh, btw, I took some flash photos of the actors before the performance. No red eye, but I did have to Photoshop out some bright orange reflections in the glasses one of the actors was wearing, and rebuild her eye. (There was nothing behind us that would have produced that orange light, so Im assuming, perhaps unfairly, that it was some flash artifact of the camera.) 

This camera may perform far more admirably for more normal photographers than I! If youre considering this (or any)camera, pick it up from a source that has a generous return policy (like Costco), and try it out first, see if it suits you. In these tough financial times, this is a stiff investment for many; halfway between a point and shoot and a real DSLR, so if you have the resources for a camera, be fussy and make sure you get one you absolutely love, even if you have to pay more (or less). This one wasnt my true camera love, but it might be yours.

<Content>I bought my FZ28 from another vendor since Amazon was out of stock. A recent Amazon user review had negative comments about the video, even indicating that it would not zoom during video.

The FZ28 does, in fact, zoom during video and the clips are very good. HD video is one of the features I like. Comparing the FZ28 with an HD Canon that I have, the Pany falls slightly short only in the lack of stereo sound. The audio is acceptable, however, just fine for most people.

I initially gave this camera only four stars but just upgraded it to five. I do not like the menu system but I suspect thats my problem since I have used Canon for many, many years. People that started with Pany probably prefer their menu system.

The FZ28 is a fine camera with many options. I especially like the simplicity of the EZ zoom settings and the ability to store four custom settings. I get really good pictures and videos. The camera is much smaller and lighter than its super zoom competitors. I also have a Canon SX10. I like both cameras but find myself grabbing the FZ28 most of the time. Its just handier.

<Content>This camera has been very good to me the past 2 years and Ive been able to take some fantastic photos for it. Its easy to use and takes a picture in a snap, no lag time most of the time. Its especially good at taking animal photos, since animals are constantly in motion and if you are a good photographer you can capture perfect pictures with this Lumix.

Now, onto the video mode. This has to be the most horrible video taker ever. Whenever I try to take video, the screen comes out completely drenched in white. The white balance is far to much, it makes videos turn out white and light unless you refocus it tons of times. You also cant zoom while taking a video, which is very bad. Because I dont take video often I give this camera 4 stars but I do not reccommend it to anyone who wants a good video camera.</Content>

<Content>If you need RAW capability and a very sharp zoom lens with excellent wide and tele range in a light, easy to use camera, the FZ28 is hard to beat.  Ive had mine for three months and have shot over a thousand images ranging from macro to full telephoto, mostly portraits, sports, landscapes,  wildlife, and Im very satisfied with it.

The other 5 star reviews cover all of the features very well, so I just want to highlight the features that stand out compared to other top-end prosumer cameras.

PROS:

* The FZ28s in-lens Image Stabilization is extremely effective, much better than cameras with camera body IS.  The weak point of any non-dSLR is poor performance in low light; IS gives you back 2.5-3 stops for handheld work so you dont need to go to ultra high ISO to get the shot.  It also greatly reduces the number of blurred shots in normal light.

* The AF and shutter are quite fast and the next shot delay is smaller than with many other cameras in the same price range or higher.  (For example, the next shot delay on my Nikon 8700 is at least twice as long, enough to make me miss a lot of shots.)

* If you are shooting JPEGs, you are at the mercy of your cameras built-in software,  Most will smear details badly, especially when reducing noise at higher ISO settings, and some create a lot of color fringing in the process of over-sharpening.  The new Panasonics and Canons start with better lenses than most and mis-process the JPEGs less than any others I have seen.  I used to shoot RAW exclusively, but now I switch to JPEGs when I need to shoot quick sequences.  Having both RAW and excellent JPEG options in the FZ28 is the best of both worlds.

* For ease of use the FZ28 is tops in its field.  I tried all the contenders, and even though I was much more familiar with Nikon, Canon, and Olympus, the Panasonic had the simplest, most logical layout, menus, and controls and proved to be the easiest to learn and use.  Its also one of the lightest (maybe THE lightest) in its class, making it very easy to carry everywhere.

* Part of ease of use is that when you are in a hurry to get a shot, you can pick a scene type or go full auto (IA) and just wing it and you will normally get results every bit as good as you can get by fiddling with the settings.  I used all-manual 35mm and medium format cameras for 25 years, so admitting this is kind of hard, but damn, this camera is smart!  One reason it is so good is that scene and face detection really work well.  This means, for example, that when you are shooting in auto mode, the FZ28 focuses on the faces even if they are off-center.  No more taking pictures of two people and finding that the AF or AE locked on a bush between and 30 feet behind them!

* Its one of the few cameras in its class that can take HD video.  The video quality is excellent and AF and stabilization are effective in video mode.  On the other hand, the sound quality drops off quickly with distance and file size is large, as you would expect for 1280x720@30fps.

* Good Mac-compatible image processing software is included free.  The RAW converter is at least as good as Adobes.

* Reliability:  CU rates Panasonics best on frequency of repairs.

CONS:

* No PC connector or hot shoe for off-camera flash.  (This is only a minor drawback, since you can get slave strobe units that can be triggered by the built-in flash.)

* No swing out LCD screen.  This was almost a deal-breaker for me, and I still miss it.  I find that I use the viewfinder all the time for shooting now, which means a bit more stretching and bending for high and low camera angles.  Fortunately, the FZ28s viewfinder is bright and easy to use, even for us old trifocal wearers.  Some PS cameras have such awful viewfinders that you almost have to use the LCD, a big problem in bright light.


CONCLUSION

At the moment, the nearest competitor to the FZ28 is probably the Canon SX10 IS.  The Canon has some advantages, notably a hot shoe, a great viewfinder, a swing-out LCD, and slightly sharper jpegs.  On the down side, the Canon is MUCH bigger and heavier, almost the size of an SLR, its images have quite a bit of color fringing, the video is limited, the lens gets fairly dim (f/5.7, a full stop darker than the FZ28) at full telephoto, and it cant shoot RAW.  (RAW requires post processing but generally produces better quality images.)  If you dont care about those negatives, the Canon is a good choice.  They are important to me, so the Panasonic was the hands-down winner for me, but you can make great pictures with either one.  (If you need RAW, but can live with a very short 5x zoom, the Canon G10 is another decent alternative.)

IF ITS THAT GOOD, IS IT BETTER THAN A DSLR?

The key is, better for what?  _IF_ you dont need to shoot in very low light, or shoot very rapidly for extended periods, or make 20x30 prints, then yes, for the first time, we can say that the new top-end pointshoot cameras are better than a lower-end dSLR.  Theres a lot of snobbery about dSLRs, and theres no question that pros need to have them for several reasons, but if none of those special requirements apply to you, I would unhesitatingly go with the FZ28.

Of course, even a cheap dSLR, equipped with decent image stabilizing lenses to cover the same range of focal lengths, is going to cost at least 4 to 6 times as much as an FZ28.  Thats a lot to spend for status if you dontt have to.  And then theres another advantage of a high-end PS over an SLR.  Any camera with interchangeable lenses has a major weakness:  dust on the imaging sensor.  It can mess up an entire shoot without your knowing it.  Non-SLRs like the FZ28 are sealed and dont have that problem.

Finally, remember this:  THE CAMERA YOU HAVE WITH YOU WILL TAKE INFINITELY BETTER PICTURES THAN THE CAMERA YOU LEFT AT HOME!  A dSLR with 2 or 3 big lenses and associated gear is just too heavy and too bulky to carry around with you everywhere.  Its also too conspicuous and too expensive to risk in many places.  For both of those reasons, the top end Canon and Panasonic superzooms are becoming the favorite everyday, walkaround cameras for a lot of pros as well as serious amateurs.

<Content>In January, I surprised myself by narrowly choosing the Panasonic FZ28 over the Canon SX10 IS.  How could this happen?  I am a longtime Canon user and had set out to buy another Canon.   A month later, Digital Photography Review named the FZ28 and SX10 IS joint winners in its Super Zoom group test and gave both cameras highly recommended ratings.  [...]

The Super Zoom review helps explain how I had picked the FZ28 over the SX10 IS.  There is a little edge for the SX10 IS for having slightly better image quality, a little more zoom, a larger optical magnification, a larger viewfinder, a vari-angle LCD and a flash hot shoe.  But, prints made from images with the FZ28 are very high quality and have no purple fringing from images made at the longest zooms like the prints from SX10 IS images have.  Also, the LCD of the FZ28 is slightly larger for a little better viewing and the SX10 IS lacks two very important features that the FZ28 has: Raw image format (Raw) and high definition (HD) movie recording.  

The FZ28 is also lighter than the SX10 IS, especially when carrying extra batteries.  The SX10 IS weighs 800gr. (28.2oz) with a spare set of four AA batteries for approximately 1200 still images using NI-MH rechargeables.  The FZ28 uses Lithium rechargeables and weighs 507gr. (17.9oz) with two spare battery packs for approximately 1380 still images.
  
Anyone who has ever carried a Canon PowerShot A610-640 series camera will be pleased to find out that the FZ28 has the same carry weight as the A600 series and a comfortable old school feel.  Somehow, Canon left out an upgrade replacement for the A600 series and Panasonic filled the vacancy with much more camera with Super Zoom and other advanced features in the FZ28.

I can add little to the other favorable reviews written except:

*	For changing menu settings and aperture and shutter values quickly, the Joystick is easy to use if it is moved deliberately and not too hurriedly.
*	The FZ28 is ideally lightweight to carry while walking or hiking and also to use on a monopod to brace it, especially for the longer 12x to 18x zooms.  The 11x zoom approximates a focal length of 297mm which is about the longest lens that I can use handholding a camera and focus without some image shake.

In making his arguments to reject the FZ28 in what is considered the most helpful critical review, Mark Justice Hinton mjh appears to somewhat confuse optical magnification with zoom ratio and apparently he is unfamiliar with Raw in some popular Canon cameras.  Out of a sense of fairness to existing and potential future owners of the FZ28, the mjh review deserves these rather basic clarifications and rebuttal:

*	Magnification and zoom in a variable lens are different parameters, but both are related to focal length.
*	Magnification is quantified as the maximum focal length of a zoom lens divided by the focal length of a normal lens.  A normal lens approximates the field of vision of human eyes and 50mm (35mm equivalent) is the approximate normal lens for digital cameras.
*	The magnification of the FZ28 is 486mm / 50mm = 9.72 and the magnification of the DSC-H5 is 432mm / 50mm=8.64.  The actual magnification difference between the DSC-H5 and the FZ28 can be seen by zooming the FZ28 to 16x its 432mm position and then to 18x for its maximum focal length of 486mm.  The FZ28 increase in magnification over the DSC-H5 is a modest 9.72 / 8.64= 1.125 or 12.5%.
*	With the larger LCD of the DSC-H5, it was possible for mjh to see an in-camera image at the maximum focal length of the DSC-H5 as being approximately the same size as an in-camera image at the maximum focal length of the FZ28.  The LCD of the DSC-H5 being 22% larger in area than the LCD of the FZ28 would make it more difficult to see the difference in the two cameras magnifications.
*	What mjh seems to refer to as the vagaries of the x factor in comparing zooms is the range of focal lengths from the shortest (widest angle) to the longest (maximum telephoto) lens.  The range of lens focal lengths is commonly referred to as the zoom ratio and is 18:1 for the FZ28 and 12:1 for the DSC-H5.  The shortest lens of the FZ28 is 27mm and its longest lens is 486mm and 486mm / 27mm = 18 focal length positions each 27mm apart.  The FZ28 with 18x zoom has six more useful focal length positions than the 432mm / 36mm =12x zoom of the DSC-H5 does.  If one compares zooms without confusing zoom with optical magnification, the FZ28 starts its 1x zoom with a true wide angle of 27mm to capture more surrounding area in an image than the DSC-H5 does at 36mm and has 18x-12x=6x or 50% more valuable focal length positions (lens) than the DSC-H5 has.
*	It is unclear how mjh determined that the DSC-H5 Auto mode captured a brighter image than the FZ28, but it is likely that he was comparing images using both cameras LCDs in PLAYBACK.  If so, it is doubtful that mjh set the FZ28 LCD mode to POWER LCD using the PLAYBACK menu.  One has to use the PLAYBACK and not the RECORD menu to change the LCD mode if the FZ28 is in the Auto (IA) mode.  The FZ28 default LCD mode is AUTO POWER LCD which is not nearly as bright as POWER LCD.
*	Contrary to the opinion of mjh that it is crazy and unacceptable for the FZ28 not to have Raw in Auto (IA) mode, I would have been surprised to find Raw could be used in Auto (IA) mode.  Auto mode is simply Point and Shoot mode and gives a camera almost total control over all its settings.  Not having Raw in Auto mode has been standard in Canon cameras models that I know about.  Neither the G10 nor the G9 have Raw in Auto mode.  The EOS 40D SLR does not have Raw in the Basic Zone which includes Auto mode, and Raw can only be used in the Creative Zone which has the manual, program, aperture and shutter control options.  </Content>

<Content>I spent a lot of time researching before I bought this camera, and now that Ive played with it for a couple weeks and taken hundreds of pictures, I figured Id pass on some of the things that had interested me in the camera for future buyers.

First off, I rated this camera five stars. Not because its the best camera in the world, but because it does an excellent job of everything it aspires to do. Ill start off with some pros and cons.

Pros:
-Minimum focal length of 1mm; excellent for close-ups.
-The telephoto is awesome, and in one contained lens.
-Image stabilization works beautifully.
-The HD video is of better quality than my dedicated HD camcorder.
-The controls and menu are dense, but very intuitive. I found myself looking at the manual only for one or two trivial things. I had handled a Fujifilm camera before buying this one, and at the time I was thinking How am I going to get used to using this thing? The menu makes no sense. I was relieved that Panasonic did a much better job.
-The LCD is something I consider to be ancillary and wasnt a factor in choosing this camera, but, for those who are interested, it is big, bright and seems to perform well outdoors.
-I was afraid the joystick was going to be problematic for manual focus (as opposed to a focus ring, which this camera lacks), and that it would be difficult to use for fine adjustments, but that is not the case. Its very easy to use and the manual focus assist (enlarges a portion or all of the image to see detail) helps greatly.
-Battery life is good. Its rated for 400 pictures, and I know I took about that many the first time I used it on one charge, with no shortage of playing with the LCD for reviewing images and checking out menu features.

Cons:
-I find that the autofocus doesnt want to focus on things within a couple inches of the lens, even when spot AF is enabled on the item. The same is true of telephoto macro shots where the camera is near its minimum focal distance for that zoom. For these shots, I use the manual focus. Personally this isnt a bother, but I list it under cons as it may be for some. Interestingly, my old Nikon 4100 did a better much job of autofocusing for macro shots.
-As others have said, yes, the manual focus can be engaged accidentally, but personally I keep the display on and check my settings before taking a picture. Ive done it and caught myself before it was a problem a couple times now.
-The camera body does feel as though a fumble to the floor would do it no favors. But, its light, and ergonomic.
-The battery/card compartment is inaccessible when the camera is mounted on a tripod/tripod shoe.
-The raw image format is RW2, which if I remember correctly is a proprietary format designed for Panasonics supplied software. I havent shot any raw yet, so Im not sure if my version of Adobe Camera Raw will support RW2, but I know that earlier versions wont. Id suggest researching to see what, if any, versions of Camera Raw support RW2 before buying if thats a deal breaker for you. I also have not installed Panasonics supplied software (If I cant use Camera Raw, Im not interested in the feature).

Other things to note:
-It actually took me a few days to figure out the quick menu. Id been using the joystick for navigation, but I knew was also supposed to serve as a quick menu and I was confused because nothing happened when I pressed it. Well, for some reason it took me that long to try holding the button down. It takes about a second holding to activate the quick menu, probably to prevent accidental button presses when using the joystick.
-So far Ive found no use for the burst mode. My experience has been that if you want to catch a still of something happening quickly, the best way to do it is to record a video and then use the cameras review mode to snap a still from it. I have some shots of a 9mm casing ejecting from a semi-auto rifle that were done this way. The quality will never be great, but certainly its enough to know whats going on.
-The shutter lag and repeat between shots are things people have reviewed both positively and negatively, but I find them both to be as expected in sufficient light. I wouldnt categorize them as either pros or cons.
-I never use the intelligent auto mode. Even for snapping pictures of family and friends. I prefer to use aperture priority mode with face detection if I want to snap a few casual images. Im sure the IA mode has a use for some users, but my thinking is that for anyone vaguely camera-literate, its purpose is limited.

Having written this it seems like I spent more time talking about what could be wrong with the camera than with whats right with it, but thats because I wanted to address the things that might concern people. Plus, its easier to list the things that are wrong with the camera than the things that are right with it - that list would be too long. Its a safe bet that if Ive omitted something in this review its because it landed in the pro side and I felt it would be a given.

To summarize, this is a great compact camera that gives the user significant control over his images. That being said, if you want the absolute best shots you can get in low light situations, a DSLR is the only way to go. Likewise, if youre a casual photographer and dont plan to use the manual settings, I would say there are other cameras that would be cheaper, more conveniently sized, perhaps easier to use and may even work better for what you want than this camera. But for people like me who want a significant amount of control over their images, and want to be able to photograph just about anything without carrying around a bag full of lenses and a bulky DSLR body, this is the camera for you.

<Content>I always do a lot of research before I buy anything over $50.  I was impressed by this camera and its reviews.  After recieving it, I looked at how thick the manual was and got very overwhelmed. I was used to a point and shoot type of camera.  This is to an extent.  It does so much more and I am discovering new and amazing things everyday ( descided not to read the ENTIRE manual!) My favorite feature is the sports mode.  I have a daughter who is almost 1, and getting her to sit still for a nano second is virtually impossible.  This mode inables me to get a shot of her in that nano second before she moves. I love this camera and I think if you are looking for a camera that is going to last a life time and a camera that take pictures that you will enjoy for a life time, then I believe this is the camera for you.  If I could have, I would have given this camera 10 stars!</Content>

<Content>We are a Canon-centric family and we almost bought the competitive Canon model. By the time you read this all model numbers will change so there is no point in being more specific. 

Im glad we bought the Lumix DMC-FZ28K. It received a real test at Mardi Gras when I took hundreds of quick shots while marching in a parade. Almost every one was as good as could be. The lens is much better than I expected, and with 10 MP to play with, even wide-angle master shots have enough resolution for cropping. 

I have no real complaints with the camera per se. I wish it had barn doors over the lens, but then again, no competitor has them either, and they would drive up size, weight and cost.

My feedback is that the camera, like its competition, has just too many modes for most users. Five or six modes are all 99% of users will need. I love the movie feature and thankfully Panasonic chose MOV over AVI or Real format. But the mode dial is so crowded with all these frivolous choices that getting from IA (default) to movie or other significant mode is not easy especially when lighting is poor. The reality is that this market is very competitive and each manufacturer tries to cram in as much as possible to the detriment of usability. Some company is going to have to find the courage to make these digicams user-centric, not market-driven, and explain the reasoning to the consumer. This has already happened to a degree in audio, personal computing, and automobiles, and it is high time for the digicam world to follow suit.</Content>

<Content>I have owned many digital cameras.  This camera far exceeds any camera I have ever owned.  The 18x zoom gets you close enough for just about anything.  The colors are vibrant.  The pictures are sharp,  and it can also take pictures in RAW format for even better processing if you have photoshop.

If you dont want to carry a digital slr with many lenses, then this is the perfect camera for you.


Ive now owned this camera for about 10 months, and I still havent seen a better one released yet.  There is enough here for the people that just want to point and shoot, as well as ample for the photo enthusiast.  You cannot go wrong buying this camera.

<Content>After a long and tiring search, both my neighbor and I decided to buy this Panasonic digital camera and both are extreme impressed with the overall qualities, the cameras weight and feel, the very moderate price and the little software tricks that make the average photographer like me (weekend, casual use) thrill with the professional-like results.  The seller was perfect in its execution of the sale and shipping and I could not be happier that I did not buy the Nikon D40 or higher camera series that would have ocst me another 300 dollars and more than the 30 I spent with this Panasonic.  What else can I say?  Two families are very happy. </Content>

<Content>Ive been into photography for 35 years. Mostly using Nikon equipment but never a digital except for a basic point and shoot for work until I bought the Lumix.  I bought this camera based on the reviews but have been dissappointed because I find it very hard to get good, sharp photographs no matter what settings I use.  I almost always use a tripod when shooting, so I know Im not shaking the camera when the shutter releases.

Otherwise, the features of the camera are easy to use and it seems fairly well-built.  If only it would focus properly, it would be great.

<Content>It really is extremely difficult to take a bad photograph with the Panasonic Lumix FZ28K. Its that good.

Ive always been an Olympus guy and I still think they make great cameras but when I decided to upgrade the pixel count from my 7MP Olympus SP 550 UZ, the research I did on the net led me to the reviews for this Panasonic model and they were just too good to ignore so I did the unthinkable- I changed brands! Reluctantly mind you, but I did and I dont regret my decision.

This camera is just gorgeous. It is very well made, you can feel that as soon as you pick it up and start to play around with it. Sure its all plastic but trust me- its solid. 

The Leica lens is MAGNIFICENT- there is just nothing like it- from full 27mm wide angle (beautiful for scenic vistas) to full extension telephoto at 18 X optical zoom it is VERY fast, responsive and accurately reproduces your subject. Downsizing to 3MP file sizes you can actually zoom up to 32.1 X which is just incredible! Photos are still very usable at 3MP for up to 6x4 prints so dont dismiss this functionality out of hand for super levels of optical zoom.

Colors are magnificent and the photos are always sharp and vibrant. Its literally almost impossible to get a bad shot with this camera. I havent had one yet except for one night shot where I didnt have my tripod. As a guy who loves night photography, this camera takes the best night shots of any Ive used with minimal image noise.

The thing I love most about this camera when I compare it to every other Ultra Zoom Ive ever owned though, is its BLAZING FAST auto focus- seriously- its practically instant even in low light. Just amazing. No more blurry hunting around in the dark to try and find focus, with this camera it snaps on very quickly indeed. 

Panasonics Mega OIS (optical image stabilization) works like a dream even at full telephoto in eliminating hand shake for blur free shots.

The menu is so easy to navigate I have barely had to open the manual. I also love the quick menu which is instantly accessible via the small joy-stick positioned at your right thumb. 

It takes really good HD video footage (although the file sizes are HUGE) and what is really nice is that you can actually zoom whilst taking video unlike many UZ cameras.

I could go on and on but let me just say, this is the best Prosumer Ultra Zoom camera on the market at the moment in my opinion. Buy it, you will not be disappointed. Five stars easily.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera as a prelude to a DSLR which I hope to buy sometime in the future. The DMC-FZ28K is quite easy to use and it has a number of options to keep you busy. Most of the time, I just leave the mode at iA (intelligent Auto) which I find its pretty good unlike the Auto mode of the previous cameras which I have owned. The iA can differentiate between flourescent, tungsten and daylight conditions quite well. If there is one feature which I would like to add is a lens with a wider aperture setting. The current widest aperture opening between 2.8 to 3.5 (depending on light conditions and lens settings) is just not sufficient to really make good use of the aperture priority mode. Well, its the DSLR next...</Content>

<Content>I have owned many different digital cameras including a DSLR setup over the years.  What I have been looking for is a camera is easy to handle and that can take good pictures in low light without a flash.  You might say that I am the un-offical photographer for a local high school choir and drama department, since my spouse is the teacher.  The low light and the dance moves associated with stage productions are really challenging to photograph. I just dont like the size of the DSLR and changing lenses about the stage without disturbing the audience too much.  I have found the this DMC-FZ28K fits the bill.  I am very happy with the camera features, value ($299) and the results.  I especially like the intelligent ISO mode and the big zoom (I can really fill the frame with close ups). It works for me.  All I need is dark clothes, a tripod, the FZ28K, and a gentle touch. The students love the pictures and they have been very helpful to teach the student the visual aspects of their performances. One girl said, Oh, now I have to pay attention on stage, I never know when you are going to take my picture!       </Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera in early December, after much research and the realization that although I had thought I wanted a DSLR, I really didnt want to lug around all the additional lenses Id want.  Thats when I discovered the intermediate (more than point and shoot, not SLR) digital.

I had intended to buy a Nikon, upgrading my still wonderful CoolPix 4800.  But after reading a zillion reviews (owner and professional), decided that the Panasonic Lumix FX28 had the quality, features, including a Leica lens, and price that were just right.

I took the camera on my recent vacation and took almost 500 pictures, ranging from a leap by Shamu at Sea World to a Caribbean sunset to an ant tending some aphids on a plant in Curacao. Oh, and a couple of people pictures too! The card I had held all the pix with room for more, and I only had to change the battery once!

On the whole, I was quite pleased with the pictures. The telephoto works fantastically (I never would have had such good pictures of those whales we saw - in the wild - without it and the stabilizer), the regular photos are excellent, and the macro is pretty good, although I still have to completely master that mode with this camera.

I like the size and heft of the camera and dont mind that it doesnt fit in my pocket. Being an older photographer, I still prefer the feel of a real camera in my hands. This one feels as real as my beloved old (retired) Olympus OM1.

A con or two - I agree with the reviewer who noted that the manual focus button is awkwardly placed - early on I took a whole series of bad shots before I realized what had happened. There is a lot to learn about the camera if one wants to fully utilize all the features and controls and some might consider that a problem. Im looking forward to experimenting and learning.

All told, Im very happy with this camera and would have given it 4.5 stars if that were allowed - its better than a 4, but not quite a 5.  Cant wait for spring and all those flowers.</Content>

<Content>This in no Nikon, but it is an excellent value. 10mp, nice 35-420mm manual zoom.  Big, heavy, rugged, and fits my big hands like a real camera ought to. The articulating viewfinder is wonderful and comes in handy often. Images a bit contrasty out of the box, so go into camera settings and set it to low contrast and leave it there. For maximum image quality, turn stabilizer off. The lens is a fine Leica TV-camera-type 12:1 hand-operated optical zoom. This means you can go out hiking and shooting pix of wildlife or landscapes without lugging around other lenses, and reframe very quickly. Images are not as stunningly sharp as a much-more-expensive Nikon, but they are pretty darn good. Everything you read in the product literature is true and works just fine, with these caveats: Leave ISO set to 100 and turn the automatic ISO adjust off because at faster settings images will be grainy, especially in dark areas. Manual focus switch is in an awkward location and it is easy to forget you unintentionally left it on manual focus. Bottom line: Great pro camera if you cannot afford a Nikon D80 or better plus all the Nikkor lenses youll need. I EXHIBIT and SELL gallery-quality wildlife and landscape images taken with this great camera. [...]</Content>

Only negative is that is is rather large, comes with a neck strap not a wrist strap, wont be taking it everywhere, but great for special occasions where you dont mind carrying a larger camera.  I already have an everyday camera.</Content>

<Content>This is my hiking camera. It has a nice wide field of view at the wide end and honking zoom range. I use the small viewfinder more than I expected, its a nice luxury in bright sunlight. The plastic body keeps the camera surprisingly light (and cheap) but it is almost square, so it needs to be carried around your neck, or in a backpack, or in a very large beltpack.
The greatest weakness is the small sensor which gets noisy at higher ISOs (surprise). It also autobrackets only +- 1 EV. But it is easy to tweak the base exposure so one /can/ underexpose 1 EV, take a series of 3 bracketed exposures, then overexpose 1 EV and take three more exposures. Youll get 6 exposures that cover -2 to +2 EV (and one duplicate normal exposure). Since the camera takes the three bracketed exposures quickly, its easier done than said.
For a $300 camera its good. Id like to see Leicasonic put in a larger sensor; Id pay another $100 for that camera.

<Content>I decided I would take my Christmas bonus and spend it on myself! I had been looking to replace a very old digital camera. After looking at many reviews and opinions, I decided to go with this camera.

Within only a couple of days of receiving the camera, we had a horrible ice storm -- what better time to test out your camera! I have the most unbelievable pictures. The zoom quality was amazing.

After a snow storm (about a month after having the camera) I took a picture and sent it into a Boston News station, it was selected as the weather picture of the day.

I can not wait to take this camera on vacation!</Content>

<Content>I bought this to replace my HP digital camera that no longer turned on reliably.  It has a more powerful zoom and I was able to get a great picture of a hummingbird the first day I used it.  However, this is a camera that comes with a huge manual and a big chunk of it must be read before trying to set up the camera to use it.  Not for people who just want to take the thing out of the box and start taking photos.  Those willing to read the manual will get good photos.  And because its a digital camera, youll know right away if your photo is going to be bad and can try again right away.</Content>

<Content>I played with all the super zooms for weeks before deciding on the Panasonic.  I needed a bridge camera to hold me over until the full frame sensor SLR bodies become more affordable.  I am a low and natural light junkie and this is my first digital camera purchase.  Its low light, still and video performance is much better than your typical point and shoot which is what I am comparing it to. (That means I can live with it).  Ive only had it 3 weeks and I am still learning.  

Things I like.
-I love this lens!  At this price point you will not be able to find a lens anywhere that is this good.  This is an enormous zoom range and there is very little distortion or color error at its zoom extremes.  No, its not perfect, but I think they hit the perfect compromise between cost and performance.  If they had tried to stretch this zoom any further, like to say 20X, I think they would have ruined it.  Zooms with this range give up a lot and this one gives up as little as possible.  To see what I mean, take a sheet of aluminum foil (shiny side up) and crumple it into a ball and lay it in bright, high noon sun.  Then photograph it at full zoom and then look at the shot with the 16X digital zoom and you will see very little color. Mostly a little bit of violet or light blue.  If I photograph a white bird in bright sun, I get a print of a white bird.  I am not suggesting this is APO performance, just that this is a very good lens on a camera that only cost me $257.00.  It stands out among its competitors.  

-I like the flash...its good enough that I dont need or want an external flash.  So far the furthest I have tried is 26 feet in a darkened room and it did fine.  Some burn out on close up light colored objects but I am still in the learning process. With a partial discharge or used as a fill flash it recycles quickly.  (In comparison to its competitors).

-I like having manual controls and the ability to do time exposures.  (the limit is 1 minute) And I like the overall flexibility of the programs.  I like the Intelligent Auto mode and find it gets it right most of the time.  Color balance is great.  Shots taken under store, office, and home lighting look just fine. I have not gotten the swing of the aperture and shutter priority modes yet.  I am still struggling trying to translate this digital language into the 35mm film language in my head.  

-I like the viewfinder and being able to adjust it for my eyes.

-I am impressed with the battery life and like it that the camera came with everything I needed but the SDHC card.  

-Overall I like the quality of the video.  Units made after July 2008 got an upgraded sound system (according to the insert in box) and my videos cant be played on cameras made before that date.  The sound is not great but its OK.  We were on the tarmac at Dekalb Peachtree airport and I was filming the news helicopters coming in at the end of the day.  They were about 250 feet away and I could still hear my sons voice and the voice of one of his flight instructors over the sound of the choppers.  I did not get to listen to the older version of this camera so I cant make a comment by comparison.
  
-The speed of the camera...sometimes its fast as lightning...more on that.  I am using a Panasonic class 4 SDHC memory card (minimum recommended speed for HD video).  The class 4 card sped up the time between shots quite a bit as compared to the internal memory. So Im going to order a class 6 card and see if it goes any faster between shots.  

-Super light weight.  (The Canon was a monster to lug around). I can carry it for hours without issues. Not around my neck but in a jacket pocket or on my hip.

Things I dont like.
-To my dry winter hands it is a little bit too slippery to hold.  I wish it had a rubberized body.  My perception of the build quality is that if I drop it 4 feet onto concrete I am going to do some serious damage. I would be surprised if it survived. To be fair though, in the past, when I have dropped electronic items, the lighter the object the better it tends to fair.  It just feels and looks like hard plastic and not at all like the Canon SX10IS. 

-The focusing is maddening at times.  Usually it is really fast...and then other times it slowly goes all the way in and then all the way back out before locking.  I have not had it long enough to figure out a way around this but it bugs me.  I almost bought the Canon SX10IS over it because of this.

-The internal menu screens do not follow a consistent pattern from one program to another so I can spend a lot of time hunting for what I want.

-In the video mode any point of light that is a bit brighter than the back ground will cause a vertical light streak.  The landing light on the channel 46 news helicopter caused a vertical streak and it was still daylight.  The Christmas tree lights caused vertical streaks in a darkened room.  If I brighten the room a bit before filming to eliminate the contrast the streaks disappeared.  

-I would have liked a folding LCD screen for when I am holding the camera above my head.  The quality of the LCD is just OK by the newest standards.   

Summary:  I am happy with it and would buy it again. Its a feature rich camera that takes great pictures.  (And the video is not to bad).  It cant match SLR performance and does not pretend to.  Super zooms are a bundle of price/performance/bulk and weight compromises.  I could find no other camera that had a zoom with this range, with a lens this clean and fast, in a body this light, with a flash this effective, with such good battery life and with so many useful features, in a package this compact and at this price point.  Those features make me willing to put up with some of its fussiness.  It is what it is and I like it.  And I can tell from the recent upgrades that Panasonic is listening...

<Content>I received the camera very quickly, right before a trip. I did not have time to read the manual (believe it or not, I actually read the manuals), but the camera was very easy to figure out (thankfully). I am impressed with how light-weight the camera is, yet still feels solid and has so many amazing features. I especially liked the variety of scene modes ... as an illustration, I arrived at a beach right as the sun was setting. I put the camera on sunset mode, and the pics came out amazing! I was actually bummed about having to buy a proprietary battery, but it lasted so long, that it will be hard to go back to AA batteries in another camera. Also, I tried out the movie function to film the countryside on a high speed train, and it came out very nice. Overall, I am glad I purchased this camera!!! And, I am glad I received the camera so fast so that I could take it on my trip.</Content>

I have an older Panasonic FX7 point and shoot and wanted something with a little more quality and options. This hit the spot dead on. When you have this camera in IA (intelligent Auto) mode it picks the best scene and flash option for you. Its cool cause you will pan across the room and when a person enters the screen it locks onto their face with the face recognition and the scene turns to portrait mode automatically. I disagree with the last reviewer and I will say this camera is perfect for beginners. You could never take this camera out of IA mode and it would be a very good purchase. The HD video is very nice especially cause you can zoom while recording, which you cant on the competition. I will say this, the audio on the recordings is [...], and i mean [...]. BUT, after i imported it, I upped the treble and lowered the bass and it sounded way better. For some examples of video go to Vimeo.com and search for fz28. Here are some options for accessories that i researched the hell out of:

Bags:
1)  Tamrac 5696 Digital 6.$28
2)  Tamrac Micro Explorer.$20

Protective Filter:
1) 46mm  Hoya Multi Coated UV(0), I have this and its very nice, better than Tiffens.$20

SDHC Card:
1) Transcend 16GB, Amazon sells this brand in all sizes for cheap.$30

Extra Battery:
1) Lenmar DLP006. Ive been burned by off name batteries in the past, but this one delivers. It has performed equal to the panasonic battery. Only $15 wow.</Content>

<Content>I brought this camera last month and so far it has met all my expectations. Its small and lightweight (compared to my SLR).  I was looking for a high quality wide to very long zoom. Wide 28 - 486 MM 35 mm equivalent. I have been taking photos for over 40 years and was looking for a camera that I could take everywhere without a lot of extra lenses and other gear. The picture quality is very good at lower ISO settings and very satisfactory at higher ISO settings. It is not perfect and I knew that before I made the purchase, but I feel it offers the best of both worlds point  shoot and SLR.

I do not recommend this for a newbie since all it controls and features can be overwhelming. But for the more experience users it a great carry around camera.</Content>

<Content>I consider myself a knowledgeable amateur photographer. This camera is awesome! I was debating for months whether get a DSLR or an ultra compact. I chose the FZ28 mainly for the 18X zoom and price. I could buy 2 FZ28s for the price of one DSLR body....
I love this camera! I shoot 90% of my shots in manual and RAW+JPEG. The menus are user friendly and pictures are great. The zoom is awesome and pretty quick. This camera also does very well in full auto. My wife can point and shoot and get great shots. All she does is power it, point, and click. The battery life is ok. The HD movies are spectacular. The burst mode is fast. The flash is powerful. The LCD screen is bright. There not much negative about this camera.....Anything above ISO400 gets a little noisy. The only thing I would add would be a hot shoe and remote. Other than that, this camera is great. For ~$200, theres nothing that even comes close with 18X Zoom and HD movies....</Content>

<Content>Its not an SLR. If you keep that in mind, youll like this camera all the better. My biggest complaint about it is the position and operation of the zoom/focus lever, it doesnt feel very natural to use.

You will get some very nice shots from this camera, especially if coming from an older camera / point-n-shoot. The zoom is great but dont take it past about 10/12x without a tripod, even the optical stabilizer cant work miracles.

The automatic settings in certain lighting situations (bright, hazy day comes to mind, as does light outdoor shadow) tend to produce somewhat washed out shots, and there are definite challenges when shooting in direct sunlight, it can be hard to find an angle without flares and ghosting.

In hindsight Id have liked to spend a week with this camera before buying it. For the money youre getting a lot but if youre a fence-sitter about shelling out for a DSLR that might be the better way to go.

<Content>I was looking to upgrade from a Nikon 5400 to something newer and better. I was looking at the Cannon Rebel, but the price was a bit too steep at this time. I did want something with a closeup ability, as well as a better zoom function than the 4x I was getting with the Nikon. Enter the Panasonic. Although I first hesitated at buying a camera made from what I would categorize as a non-traditional camera manufacturer, I was pleasantly surprised by this camera. It takes a great picture with great resolution and superb color. The image stabilization is great, since I spent so much time on photoshop trying to sharpen my images taken by the Nikon. Now my pictures are focused and need very little doctoring.  This camera has an incredible amount of functions for every situation. Its also very light and compact, making it a joy to carry around. I used to have a Cannon 35mm with various lenses, and find that this camera is more versatile and more fun to use.  The memory cards are very inexpensive, and Im about to purchase a lens adapter that will let me use my 55mm filters from my old 35mm SLR.</Content>

<Content>It looks like everything that can be said about this camera has been said. I just wanted to rate the camera and remind everyone of a few bullet points.

This camera, while larger than the compact class, is smaller and noticeably lighter than the other ultrazooms I have looked at. This can make a huge difference when youre walking around all day with it at an event or on vacation.

The Intelligent Auto setting is most impressive. Use this and anyone can take at least good pictures and most people will probably consider their shots a great improvement over past photos. If you want to use Scenes or manual settings you may then learn to do so at your own pace but its certainly not a necessary step with this camera.

Indoor photos are much improved over my past cameras. Point-and-shoots may never match up with an SLR in low light situations but most of us dont want the kind of expense, quantity of equipment/weight, or learning curve required for this sort of shooting. For this class of camera my shots have been amazingly good and IA will make any adjustments possible, with or without flash.

Also in the indoor shooting idea, having a focal length that enters the Wide Angle range is very, very helpful. Getting down to 27mm gives great side-to-side coverage without the kind of distortion youd expect in an affordable camera like this. Very nice.

Controls are very sensible and easy to master and the button to flip up the flash is conveniently located and easy to use without looking away from the screen or viewfinder.

Ive always stuck with cameras that use replaceable batteries but Im very impressed with Panasonics proprietary battery. It charges fairly quickly and seems to last forever (well, a good long time anyway). Extra batteries dont seem over-priced, especially compared to the rechargeable ni-cads Ive been using.

Sorry, I dont like to use a still camera for video but my son couldnt resist and the results were pretty darn good. Its pretty impressive that an 11-year-old could figure out how to do this, it must speak well of the camera/menu layout. Other reviewers have said more about video for you to read than I can.

All in all this camera is a great example of fulfillment of the promise of micro-processors. Full auto photography has reached a point where drastic compromise is no longer necessary and high quality photos are possible with a minimum of fuss for the entire family. A terrific camera for almost any situation! </Content>

<Content>I dont know what cheated means-- probably an Amazon offer of four years ago that I didnt get, but I do not mean that for the FZ28.
My previous best experience was with the Canon power shot series, a Canon SLR and with an Olympus SLR.  For the SLR with ten years, I only used the telephoto twice, and then image stabilization was a problem.  I never once have used the tripod.  Image stabilizaton with Canon makes their lenses each cost the same as three Z28s.  It is just too inconvenient for me to pack up and carry all the SLR equipment not knowing if I might really need a wide angle or a telephoto.  What finally forced the issue was flyfishing in NM this fall with a herd of elk moving through.  
So, the Z28 is what I chose  to fit these needs.  I have had it two months, and initially I had some problems taking holiday portraits in weird home lighting with the automatic mode.  Since then, I am learning how it works, and it is great.  The best situation was my daughter singing among several hundred at a concert a hundred feet away.  At full telephoto, it looked like a portrait shot.
The problem is its bulkiness (albeit real light and sturdy).  I cant find a cool looking case that keeps the whole package small.</Content>

<Content>A Leica lens on a Japanese camera.... Impressive most of the time.  Bought it for photographing small objects to sell on ebay  It has truly center waited focusing.  Small objects photographed with ease (if you really work on the lighting) and 10.1 MP means that you can crop a small piece from a large image, then resize it back to full screen.  Color balance has been a little bit of a challenge - but with enough lights and trying different combinations - I have it working fine.  For $250 a bargain, for $350 I would look elsewhere.</Content>

<Content>I went to a local camera shop to purchase the Canon Powershot SX10IS when the sales associate recommended I look at the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 camera.  I brought in a SD card spent about an hour in the camera store taking shots with both cameras.   I was very impressed with the quality of pictures on the FZ28 and decided to go home and do more research.  After reading reviews here at Amazon and on some camera review sites, I decided to go with the FZ28 and purchased it on Amazon (at a way better price than the store:)  I am totally satisifed with the camera.  At this point I have taken over 1000 shots and am amazed with how well it does in different shooting scenarios.   Yes... the SLRs take better shots in low light but who wants to carry an SLR with lenses everywhere?  This camera is very light in weight compared to an SLR.   

I do recommend buying good quality SD cards (the faster the better) for this camera especially if you are going to take video clips.  Also keep in mind that the camera video uses the Apple Quicktime .MOV format instead of AVI.  Overall I am very happy and would highly recommend this camera. </Content>

<Content>  I bought this camera for our family after the birth of our first grandchild. Selected this particular model after about 2 months of reviews and recommendations. I am not disappointed in any way. Camera is easy to use, takes excellent pictures and has a nice software editing program for uploading, printing and organizing all of our family photos. Would recommend without hesitation as it is a good value for money spent. I am not an experienced photographer so the ease of use feature for me is a plus. Reading the manual assures me that this camera has a lot more to offer as I become more a experienced photographer. Its light weight and fits the hand well. The only thing that seems hard for me to adjust to is the zoom toggle levering left to right on the top/front of the camera - seems a little awkward to me. I would have prefered a rocker type lever that moves forward to back in relation to the zoom itself but this is not enough of a negative to take away from the fact that this is a great camera.</Content>

<Content>I have to say was a little skeptacle when I purchased this camera. I read all the reviews and I still was unsure about buying it. I had been using a Canon Powershot S5-IS which was a total disappointment to me however I went out on a limb and got the Panasonic and boy what a difference pictures where very clear I did a comparison of them between my Canon XSI and some of the pics you could not tell the difference, and the HD video is awesome and the playback on an HD TV will blow your mind. Highly recommend this camera for anyone looking for high quality picks from a point and shoot start with this camera. Fun easy to use very compact but sturdy. I am really satisfied with this purchase.</Content>

<Content>This camera is great if you want to start your first steps in photography. Im just a beginner and its fantastic to learn and adjust manual settings. I havent used many manual options yet, but automatic mode its fantastic, optical zoom absolutly incredible and battery life never seen before (new year party I did 300 photos with flash inside the disco and the battery was still alive). 
I really recomend it!</Content>

<Content>I actually want to give it 4.5 stars, but thats not an option.

I bought this camera because I wanted the long zoom capability for photographing wildlife, and I also bought an extra 1.7x lens for extra zoom.  I just got back from a trip to south Florida, and spent a couple days in wildlife reserves.  I got some great bird shots with this camera.  Ive also taken great general, non-zoom pictures.

The pros:

Excellent lens, great zoom range - 35mm equivalent 27-486mm.

Switching to 3MP mode gives tighter magnification, to 32.1x.  Its not true optical zoom, though - it gives you the middle 3MP of the 10MP sensor.  Cropping, but not cropping.  This gave me great shots of farther-away birds that are good enough to post to the web, even to print out at smaller sizes, but of course at 3MP you cant blow them up.

Intelligent auto mode and scene modes are easy to use.  This comes with the caveat that I had to learn through trial and error which modes to use in what situations.  Birds moving around a lot, sports mode.  Birds holding still, portrait mode.

The cons:

I only have one con:  If you want to focus manually, you do that using a tiny joystick on the back of the camera.  Ive repeatedly overshot the focal point and had to go back and forth once or twice in order to get it.  The best way to use it is to use auto-focus to get you close, then switch to manual mode to fine-tune the focus.  I usually have to do that if Im trying to photograph a bird in between tree branches.

Conclusion:

Overall, an excellent camera with great long zoom capability, and just about the best you can do without spending the money on a digital SLR.  Yes, a DSLR will be faster and give you even better results, but for a much higher price.</Content>

<Content>SUMMARY
This is a great tweener camera that combines an excellent wide-angle lens with great optical zoom capability. Its got image stabilization and all the features you expect from a modern digital camera. You feel like youre using one of those pricier DSLRs, but its sold at the price point of a PS.

PROS
Great quality lens and pictures. Focus is sharp, colors are realistic, and the flash is more powerful than what you get on more compact point-and-shoots. Good build quality, feels sturdy but not too heavy; comes with a nice locking lens cap that doesnt come off accidentally. Good battery life.

CONS
The Lumix FZ28 is kind of big for a point-and-shoot, and if Im going to lug around something like that, I want a real DSLR. The screen is not as large or as nice as those on some of the other newer cameras. The zoom is a little hard to control in tiny amounts (you may overzoom and have to go back a little).</Content>

<Content>This camera is the best.  Takes great outdoor pics and zoom in incredible without losing picture quality.  I do agree that taking indoor shots are a little trickier for the perfectionists out there.  I would recommend buying a tripod to steady the camera and to explore the manual settings for indoor shots.   Dont rely on the auto  mode all the time when shooting indoors.  The manual is very extensive and I for one cannot wait to experiment with the different setting.  I LOVE the HD movie mode - very cool and great videos.  I heard complaints about the sound quality was not quite matching the video quality, but i have no problems with the sound.  

All of the great reviews sold me on this camera, and after receiving it, I am glad I did.  The link below are some shots I took downtown and around my home in Dallas.  It will guve you an idea on how easy the camera is to use.   Used first day I got right out of the box..  So many more nuances I need to learn, but cant wait to get going and sharpening my photo skills.   I know this is the camera to get me there.  You will not regret buying this camera!!!  Check out my pics in the link below taken with this camera to see for yourself

<Content>i like the camera so far.  the only drawback has been indoor picture quality.  unless you have a great indoor lighting arrangement, its hard to get an amazing picture with the auto function (which sucks because thats when i take most of the pictures of family  friends). to compensate, i will use more of the manual settings in the future totry and create a better picture. however, i used it outdoors and at night to take some awesome pictures.  the nightime setting for illumination took absolutely amazing pictures of christmas lights around the city. i also took some awesome day-time shots of the mountains near my home and used the zoom to get some pretty tight shots (love the zoom).  </Content>

<Content>I ordered this camera to replace my Canon A620 because the flash went out.  Its a great camera for still shots and portraits.  I take a lot of pictures traveling, or of grandchildren or pets.  I took the camera out to take pictures of the kids playing and I missed every shot.  There is few seconds lag between the time the button is pushed to take the picture and when the camera captures the shot.  Just enough time for facial expressions to change.  My canon caught the picture when the button was pushed.  I also noted there was a longer lag when using the flash from the time the flash fired to the time the camera captures the pic.  Its long enough that subjects think the picture has been taken and move.  I also noted some blurring in the active mode.  Clarity of pictures is also not up to par with my old canon.  I am returning this camera.  I am having a really hard time replacing the A620 as so far nothing has been up to par.  Also wish Canon had more affordable long range zoom cameras.</Content>

I guess some of the Photo snobs would pick apart some of the things on this camera, but as an Average Joe  photogragher there is plenty of room for growth with this little gem. I did a lot of research before buying and found out that this camera doesnt do any one thing perfectly, but it does many things extremely well.
I look forward to learning more about digit photography now that I have this wonderful tool. I have been pleasantly surprised with the few photos I have taken and seen on this board from other owners.
The only warning I can give about this camera is to not read the whole manual at one time as it may result in a severe ICE CREAM HEADACHE!</Content>

I lost our FZ18k - so I went shopping for another one to see if there was anything else out there. And it all came back to this one - the FZ28k. Theres a few things different about this one - but its all good stuff. I really like the video feature on it as well. We hardly ever use our camcorder anymore. 
This camera really surpasses them all. Im so glad that we purchased from Amazon also. I got my order early and there were absolutely no mishaps with my order. 
I will order again from Amazon.

<Content>I had owned this camera for about 2 weeks and I like the overall performance of this camera. It holds great in your hand and has sturdy built. LCD screen is large enough for viewing and has sharp picture, just perfect to me. Has great zoom and navigation is easy. Great shutter speed too. Battery is excellent. It last me the whole day while travelling. Great price.

The only drawback I find on this camera is the contrast of the photos taken. If compared to Canon G10 or the S5-IS, I think Canon has better contrast but for the price, you cant beat this Panny. Plus it is still made in Japan....can take HD movies too!!

Overall, I love this camera.

<Content>Ive been using the Konica Minolta Dimage z2 for many years now. It was a great camera. Its time to get a new one and FZ28K was on sale for $239. @ Amazon, I couldnt pass the deal and got one.
Its fast and the flash is much better than the z2, it doesnt make the pictures come out so bright with flashes on your face. Its 10M so you can take with big picture and crop it and still have a decent size to print.
*The best thing is it has the HD video camera built in. It is amazing with the quality in 720p, although if you dont have a firm grip, and zoom too much, its shaky. I use VideoStudio 11.5 plus from Amazon to make AVCHD dvd to play in Blu-ray player.
*It has a timer to take 3 pictures at a few seconds apart for you to change posts and such which is great. Sure is better than 1 at a time.
*The zoom iz amazing, 18x allows me to take picture from far away and catch all these faces from my kids.
*The battery lasts quite long. I filled up the whole 4 GB with HD movies and pictures @5MP and it still has some juice left.
*The pictures are great under low light without flash.
*Automatic Focus is fast but not as fast as the Z2, but efficient.

Very easy to use, even my wife can take great pictures every easily.
The zoom button should be in the back of the camera where your right thumb usually is instead of the front which is very awkward. Bad design on this part. Other than that its a great camera until your right index/middle finger get used to the zoom button.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera to use when taking pictures of my children who are involved in sports, dance, and school activities.  My older, smaller camera just wasnt getting good clear shots.  It worked fine for close ups and pictures in our home, etc. but just didnt do well for far away shots and dim lighting.  The Panasonic has been fun to play and work with.  I have taken it to several different events and once I got to the correct setting or use the automatic settings it works great.  I got good pictures of my daughters basketball game as well as good pictures of my oldest daughters band concert.  It has taken me a little bit to learn to use as it is much more advanced than my other camera but I really like it and cant wait to learn more and do more with it.  I would highly recommend this camera.</Content>

<Content>I needed a replacement for an aging Kodak TTL that got flour grained sand into the zoom mechanism during a recent trip to the Mideast. After looking at various entries from Canon and Nikon, I selected the Lumix FZ28K.

The zoom (18x) is great for candids when you dont want to be in someones face and the image stability is really remarkable for keeping the image sharp in those situations. Color rendition appears to be very accurate and the flash is adequate in most situations up to about 20 feet. I am not a professional by any means, but have been able to obtain some great shots in the few weeks that I have been using the Lumix.

The only drawback I have seen with the Lumix has been with the video aspects. I understand that this was never designed to be a video camera, but periodically one needs to shoot a little video. The HD video quality is excellent, but the sound quality is less than what I was getting from my Casio point and shoot. The .MOV format is not PC friendly (one must convert it to an .AVI to do any editing if you do not have a MAC to work up the files, and the 8+ minute time limit on HD recording can be problematic if you do not keep an eye on it. However, if you are shooting straight video and sound quality is not a major consideration, the video quality is the best Ive ever seen from a still camera.

The ability to get the depth of field and detail from a lightweight camera without all of the paraphenalia associated with an SLR was important in my selection of a replacement camera. I am very happy with my choice of the Lumix and would recommend it to anyone looking for the picture quality of an digital SLR with the ease and convenience of a point and shoot.

Great features, especially the iAutomatic functionality. However, for a newbie like me, the pictures do not appear so sharp in the display when zoomed in starting at 4x, even at 5M resolution. Im not sure if this is also the case when uploaded in the PC. But overall, I am satisfied with Lumix FZ28.</Content>

<Content>WOW!  Amazing camera that can do almost everything the very expensive SLRs can do and sometimes better.  After a lot of research, I decided that this fit my needs better than the Nikon P80.  It can do all the manual stuff but most importantly, when you need to take a quick shot, its automatic functions are by far the best.  The optical image stabilizer makes a huge difference in taking handheld shots.  It outperforms every camera I have owned or used including two Nikons and several others.  The Leica lens is by far better than Nikkor or Canon.  Its unbelievable that  you can purchase this for such a great price.  Ive only had it a few weeks but have already taken over a thousand photos and it has never failed to delver a quality photograph.  Ive actually tried to take a bad picture in IA mode but it always corrected and took a great photo.  Even in very dark settings without a flash, you will be astonished.  Even if you own an expensive camera, you will want one of these to use especially when you dont want to haul around a bunch of lenses and tripod.</Content>

<Content>first , I am happy with FZ28K .
This is my third camera .
The first two were sony P9 and Canon A570 . These small cameras are terrible for indoor pictures .
FZ28K produces great indoor picture sometimes I even thought that there was not enough light but the picture turned out great .
I have a hard-drive camcorder as well (not HD ) , what I found was I didnt take over 1 hour video in a year .
It turns out I use cameras video function to capture more video of kids,pets and vacation . Carrying two machine on vacation is also a trouble .
So I decided to find a good camera with good video function , which leaves only one choice : FZ28K 720P HD .
Canon have a similar model which only produces DVD quality , not HD .
Now Mark II is out with HD , but thats a different game . 
For the price and function , this is the best for a average consumer who takes family pictures and videos  .

<Content>We are having the same experience as Byron Bunge (review on December 14): using the iA (Intelligent Automatic) setting, we are getting consistently bad indoor photographs. Without the flash, the pictures are correctly exposed but almost invariably blurry, apparently due to camera shake or incorrect focus. With the flash activated, there is a HUGE shutter lag. We had to go back to our point and shoot camera to capture our holiday pictures. After reading all these glowing reviews, we have to presume that we got a lemon. Anyway, were calling Panasonic and will be returning the camera unless they can help.</Content>

<Content>Frankly I was very dissapointed with Amazon at first. Because after receiving the camera I used it for 2-3 days. Then I tried to upload photos but I couldnt coz amazon kept on giving the annoying error something like u cant upload photos before 24hrs of purchase... But now I think that was indeed useful because otherwise I could have missed a lot of features I discovered after using the camera over one month.

I am not a pro photographer but I can consider myself as an experienced novice. My first digital camera was Sony cybershot (2MP) 11 yrs back. I used that for a long time. Then I used Canon (5MP or recent A-series), Nikon, Olympus. Recently I decided to buy a megazoom camera. I would be lying if I say that my first choice was Panasonic. I hardly knew about this `Lumix series. So I restrained my search to Sony, Canon, Nikon and Fuji only. One day I was searching amazon for prices then suddenly this camera caught my attention. The first thing I noticed is the `Leica lens. I saw many of my pro photographer friends are really crazy about Leica lens. Then I went through the reviews (that is very important) and finally I decided to take the risk (coz at that time also I was not sure about its performance).

Now after using it regularly, I thought taking the risk was worth and the camera is worth the price. I am listing few features those impressed me most.

1.The iA mode is superb, u cant make a mistake even if u want to.

2.18x zoom is great. Even at full zoom, there is no distortion and focus remains accurate.

3.It has a true manual mode. Unlike other cameras, here u can adjust all the settings in full throttle like ISO, Shutter speed, F-Stop.

4.Unlike many other cameras, it has live Histogram function. U dont need to be a pro to understand it correctly. Just follow the rule (In general, the more pixels that are toward the right of the histogram, the  righter (or lighter) the photo will be. The corollary is that the more pixels there are toward the left of the  istogram, the darker the photo will be. There is no perfect histogram, because creative photographers take creative photos, which have all kinds of unlikely looking histograms.).  You can always check the histogram later but soon u will cherish the usefulness of getting it live.

5.It has Leica lens. It produces some super colors and finest details.

6.ISO ranges from 100 to 3200. Although it is always recommended to use lower ISO to minimize noise but hey, u may need it once suddenly.

7.Shutter speed ranges from very fast to very slow (as slow as 60 sec). Although longer shutter speeds (1/60th or 1/30th) are more likely to be blurred than shorter shutter speeds (1/250th or 1/400th), but longer shutter speed is required in low light condition with lower ISO. I would recommend u to use a Tripod in that case (a basic tripod is less than $20).

8.F-stop ranges from f/2.6 to f/8. Larger aperture numbered (f/8.0 or f/11.0) result in more depth-of-field than smaller aperture numbers (f/2.8 or f/4.0). The higher the f-stop number, the smaller the opening and greater the depth of field. So here, f/8.0=to maximize depth-of-field

9.Here u have Aaperture priority mode and Shutter priority mode. These modes are automatic--meaning, for example, that the aperture priority mode automatically sets the shutter speed based upon the aperture setting -- you have to first select an appropriate aperture setting! The same thing applies to the shutter priority mode.You set the shutter speed to be what you want and then the camera sets the aperture to get the right exposure.

10.There are lots of scene modes like party, fireworks, pets, baby (this particular has some cool features) and lots more. But I prefer Manual mode like for fireworks (f/8.0, ISO 100, Shutter speed 4-5sec). I have uploaded the firework pics and I am happy with the deliveries.

11.There is also programmable custom modes where u can save any of urs favorite settings for future use.

12.The video quality is great. It was my least expectation to get HD video from a still camera. Camera jurk is minimum with `Mode 2 stabilization. U can get great video even if holding it with hands. The good thing is that u can also use the optical zoom in videos. What else one can ask from a primarily still camera.

There are also few down things like in iA mode it produces high sharpness after removing the noise which may be unacceptable to someone. During video recording, if u zoom in or zoom out too quickly, auto focus takes time that causes some blur in the video. Moreover u cant get RAW format in iA mode. In bright sunlight, the LCD as usual gets little dim (thats when the Histogram is useful). In low light in iA mode, some noise is visible without flash. 

Although there are few drawbacks but those are not at all serious compared to the great features it has. Performance is superb and value of price is also great. I would definitely recommend this camera to those who are mainly concerned about quality and performance.</Content>

<Content>OK, so I do not quite understand the 5 stars everyone has given.  I bought this camera because I wanted to take pictures of my four boys and I read almost all of the great reviews.  I am not a professional photographer.  I am just a mom who wants to take great pictures of my kids.  I also happen to teach technology to elementary kids (K-5) and we do a lot of projects with digital cameras (we primarily use Canons, but I saw these great reviews).  I have been searching for a camera for personal use and I did not want to take the plunge into the DSLR cameras.  I guess I will have to.  This camera takes fuzzy pictures no matter what setting I am on.  It is so frustrating!  I would say if you are taking pics of subjects that do not move at all (ie. they do not breathe) then this could be the camera for you.  If not, dont waste your time or money.  This camera will not work for you.  Also, if you are into outdoor photography, then this could possibly work, but indoor pics are horrible and grainy.  If you are a parent who wants pictures of your kids, do not buy this camera!   </Content>

<Content>This item: Panasonic  Lumix DMC-FZ28S 10.1MP Digital Camera with 18x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver) has gone up $40 in price just in the last 3 weeks. It was $279.99 just before Christmas when I had hoped to get it as a gift. I assumed that I could buy it just after Christmas (naively thinking it might even go on sale) only to find it then listed at $309.99. That was 3 days ago and I looked at it today and it is now $319.99. I guess I  had better hurry up and buy it or it might be $500! Is it so popular in this economy that the price has to escalate by 15% in several weeks? I was down to this camera and the Nikon equivalent. This price escalation for the Panasonic makes the Nikon look much more buyable. </Content>

<Content>Bought this for myself as new Digital camera as well as to use to take HD videos. Received it in two short days from Amazon. All I can say so far is that this Panasonic FZ28K camera takes beautiful pictures and does a great job shooting HD video also! I also bought Panasonic SDHC card and cables to playback pics and videos directly on my Pioneer Plasma TV and WOW! I am an amatuer picture and video taker so I keep it in AUTO mode always and it does great! I like the simple menus that are easy to navigate through to go from picture to video mode. The zoom at 18X is fantastic and allows you to get close ups and it stays clear when zooming in on videos. Overall, couldnt be more satisfied with Panasonic FZ28K and Amazon!</Content>

<Content>I searched the internet and read reviews on many different cameras for about a month before deciding on the Panasonic Lumix Fz28.  Finally I narrowed it down to either the FZ28 or the Canon SX10IS.  I was leaning toward the Canon only because it had a 20x optical zoom instead of 18x zoom, but then I compared the quality of the pictures taken by both cameras on flickr.com and the FZ28 blew the Canon out of the water in my opinion.  I also loved that I could use filters on the fz28.  

I was looking for a good affordable camera for my wedding and honeymoon in Hawaii and Im sure this is it!  I received the camera for Christmas and in 2 days, I had taken over 800 pictures!  It is very addicting and now I updated Myspace, Facebook, Flickr, etc.  One thing I was very impressed with was the sunset scene.  I was in the car the other day and I took some beautiful sunset pictures.  The camera did all the work!  I look forward to taking many more awesome pictures with my new Panasonic Lumix FZ28.

I am so glad I chose the FZ28 over the Canon SX10 IS!!!! Just to let you know I never type reviews, but I just had to share this awesome product with people out there so they can make a good decision. Thanks!</Content>

<Content>I own several digital cameras including a Sony Alpha and a Canon 990IS.  The Alpha is for my Minolta lenses and the Canon is for hiking, kayaking, etc.  The Alpha is fine but not so good at higher iso and the Canon is really a fine pocketable.  I bought the Panasonic for its lens and its ability to fit in between the luggable Alpha and pocket Canon.  It does that perfectly with its small size, great zoom lens and low price.  Ive taken several hundred pictures with it and find that it gives me all the control over aperture and speed that I need.  It has a nice wide angle view at the short end of the lens which comes in handy for portraits, etc.  It has fine macro ability.  I dont care about the video focusing problems that others have commented on so I havent yet investigated that.  The camera menus are very intuitive and easy to access.  Big thumbs up from this reviewer.  </Content>

<Content>At age 71, I finally got to the point where lugging my Nikon DSLR, 3 lenses, flash, batteries, filters, etc. around became just too darn much.
I originally was going to get the Nikon P80, but the reviews on Amazon scared me off of that one! Being a 30+ year Nikon nut, I just could not go to Canon - heresy!
I knew Panasonic made grest consumer stuff and Leica sure knows how to make lenses, so that was my next place to look. I read the Amazon reviews and bought one and love it! Wonderful wide angle lens (like 27 or 28, forget which), fast, sharp pistures and, for me, the ability to shoot in raw fromat.
Unfortunately, Adobe Photoshot Elements does not recognize Panasonics raw format, so I have to use their supplied software which, it turns out, is pretty darn good. If you shot using jpeg, no problems, use whatever software you do use now.
Im not a movie guy, but it does a credible jod. You can even shoot in HD ~ if you can figure out how to obtain the required cables from Panasonic to show them on the TV.
Use it as a pint and shoot, use some of the zillions of scene modes or, like me, stick with apeture mode and I think youll love the results.
Cons:
No external flash. On the other hand, one less thing to drag around.
New software to learn for processing raw files.
Pros:
Light, responsive, excellent quality pictures.
Great price point.
Even comes with a lens hood!
Allows use of 46mm filters (cant live without my circular polarizer!)

<Content>I have purchased several Lumixii over the years,And have nothing but great things to say about Panasonic cameras.My main 2 were DMZ 50Ks and broke my teachers bank.Then one diedon me. Fix or replace, fix or replace. FIX ( money short fall)
WARNING, DO NOT get involved with the Limaceous Xanthocephalics at the Panasonic Service centres Not even worth the phone call. Run do not walk to Digitech, 1-626-359-0439.Yes an american who stands by his work. So while Panasonic was jerking me around, I bought what I thought of as stop gap, as I live to photo birds !
 The box arrived. I thought it was empty. It was so light !
Out of the box, precharged battery in. AWESOME. NOT a stop gap, but a joy to have. Fantastic pics, in minutes. ie when I decided to read the guide. CANNOT recomend enough. Still learning the nuances, like the lock on focus, but still getting good flight result. Quality = personal ineptitude !This may at first glance, look and feel like a cheap plastic toy. I guarantee it is not. 3 thumbs up.

<Content>The product is 5 star - however, when I originally reviewed the product I was led to believe it was a kit and included an extra battery pack, a case, a memory card and tripod.  I told my brother about it, who is an avid photographer and he checked it out and was led to believe the same thing.  When I received the product, it was the camera only.  This is bait and switch advertising, as far as my brother and I are concerned.
However, I am 100% satisfied with my camera.  Thank you.</Content>

<Content>I am a professional photographer and have had close to 40 digital cameras in the past 7 years.  I can easily say that this camera is the best of all cameras - especially for everyday use.  I carry this camera around everywhere in my car or on my person.  The main points are:

1)  Double image stabilization. This cant be stressed enough when youre talking about an 18x zoom camera.  I get amazingly sharp, handheld, pics at all zoom levels.  Also, you can hand hold no flash pictures with great results.

2)  Wide angle, starting at 27mm.  This is a VERY useful range.  Great for indoor family pics - you can get the whole gang in.  Great for big landscape shots outside, too.  Little to no fisheye curving at the corners.

3)  Big zoom - with little to no curving in at the corners.  

4)  Electronic View Finder.  (EVF)  This is great in brightly lit outdoor situations where the LCD is hard, or impossible, to see.  (though I havent had that issue too much with the LCD on the FZ28).  I wont buy another digicam without an EVF or a regular viewfinder.  Too many times Ive been stuck where I cant see what Im taking.

5)  10mp.  This isnt super important, but it helps when you want to get some shots that came out blurry at 10mp but look fine whene scaled down, so you can still get a nice 8 x 10 out of it.  Having said that, I shoot at 3mp or under most times, for regular family and fun shots.  Anything serious or artsy, go the full 10, perhaps.

6)  HD video with ZOOM capability!!!  Very few cameras allow zooming.  The quality is excellent even in normal indoor lighting.

7)  Great LCD.  Big and hi-res.

And more.  Like great controls; SMALL camera and very lightweight.  Fits in a fanny pack.  Comes with a lens hood, for sunny outdoor shots.  Lecia lens!!  Fantastic.  Quick and responsive.  USes SDHC cards.  Great battery life.

Truly, this is a no-brainer.  And for around $300, its just plain AMAZING.</Content>

<Content>I am a hobby photographer , especially of flowers and nature, so , I was looking for a camera with excellant macro  zoom. 

I researched all the internet reviews and also read the reviews here at Amazon. There are almost 100 reviews for the FZ28 black model, same camera, just a different color  the silver model  has a lower price  !! There are also some great pics to look at on the Amazon reviews.

Based on my findings I bought this camera, and love it !! I first thought it was going to be hard to operate , but a short once over with the manual while the battery was charging (about 2 hours), I was ready to take pics. I was very pleased with the shots...no red eye in a close up portrait, natural skin tones. White flowers did great ,no flash wash out. Zoom was fanatastic. Face detection great ! Picture from a distance in a dimly lit room was great.  This camera can make you look like a pro at taking pics ! 

I was always a AA battery fan but after seeing my friends similar style Kodak camera eat them after only a few shots, I am glad this camera had the litium ion and charger. I ordered a spare that was recommended on the reviews.

I look forward to learning more about what this camera can do from a camera geek friend of mine who is anxious to see it after sending them some shots I took.  Great camera for a hobby photographer !</Content>

<Content>bought 1 month in order to replace my 4 years old Olympus C8080 Wide Zoom.

In picture quality, FZ28 almost reaches C8080 standard.(Olympus got huge optical lens 5x Zoom, Highest Quality in its field)
In Camcorder aspect, FZ28 surpasses 8080 a mile. HD 1280x720 60 FPS vs 320x240 15 FPS. 

The cons are: cheap built, all plastic (C8080 is build on Magnesium alloy which is still shining when sets side by side with FZ28K),
moive sound is low and dull. HD movie recording time is 9 minutes a time no matter how big your SD memory card is.

But for the money, FZ28K is the best. C8080 costed me $[...] four years ago.

With this option you can take several pictures in a row with just one push of a button.  So your sure to get at least one really great picture. The portrait setting with soft skin is great for family/holiday photos.  I would highly recommend this camera.</Content>

<Content>When i read all the reviews before buying camera, everything else looked fine. I was initially a bit skeptical about the video taken by the camera. There is a lot of stress on HD video and capacity in the reviews. Although i was not looking for any HD video feature.

WVGA Video - I went to an Ice hockey game last week and tried the manual shutter speed adjustments, sports mode and video shoot the game in WVGA quality which is next to HD in the camera options. I was actually impressed by the quality of the video and sounds captured in the video. I could very easily and smoothly zoom in an zoom out while shooting the video and it captured everything with a very high quality even while using 18x zoom. i was sitting far behind in the stadium.

Sports - Also the sports mode worked really well. I could capture some really rare shots pretty well. 

IA mode at night - I also tried to shoot some Christmas decorations in my neighborhood at night. And at some point the Intelligent auto mode was actually better than my manual settings. The IA mode really rules. 

I am uploading some sports shots and night shots for reference at Panasonic  Lumix DMC-FZ28S 10.1MP Digital Camera with 18x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver). I am really happy i chose this camera.</Content>

<Content>I have had an FZ8 for about 16 months and like it a lot.  I just received my new FZ28 last night, so this is only a preliminary review.  The FZ28 is a much-mproved version of the FZ8.  One of the things they improved is the speed of image download to the computer.  On the FZ8 they claimed USB2, and technically they were correct, but the actual speed was more like USB1.  On the FZ28 it really is USB2.  There are also more burst-mode options, including some that are machine-gun fast if you are willing to accept 3 mb photos (which are fine for most ordinary purposes).  The lens offers a much more useful wide-angle of 27mm (35mm equiv.) versus the FZ8s 36mm.  Viewing photos is more convenient now, with a dedicated switch within easy reach.  A first look at the high-ISO side shows better color and less noise than with the FZ8, though the FZ8 wasnt bad in that respect.  Theyve kept the camera light in weight and it has the same efficient battery system.  The high-def video, which was an important reason for me buying this camera, looks good but it runs at a data rate that is just a little too fast for my 2.4-gh Pentium IV desktop - the video skips and freezes.  It runs fine on my newer dual-core laptop.  Looks like Ill have to do some upgrading on hardware and software (for video editing).</Content>

<Content>This Camera is just a fun machine. It is loaded with tons of  fearutes of which I liked the most are iA mode, face detection, Ultrazoom lense (18x at 10MP and the lense power can be increased by adjusting to different picture resolutions *excellent feature*) and the video shooting mode.

DMC-FZ28 is powered with the newly developed Venus Engine IV that supports a faster response time enabling the camera to shoot and reload quickly for the next shot. (Cannot expect the responsiveness of a DSLR though..)

The Video capabilities are just amazing, accept for the length of the clip that restricts it to 2GB in HD mode. (thats acceptable for a PS camera).Another interesting feature in this camera is that you can zoom in and out while shooting a video clip.

The still picture quality degrages at higher ISO settings but it still holds good amount details at reduced picture size.

Panasonic has tried their best to pack as many fearures as possible for a PS into this model. But the camera lacks the outer feel. The buttons gets a cheap feel compared to the other competitors like Nikon P80, Sony H50 and the Canons. But if you just care for quality photos and ignore the aesthetic aspects this camera is definitely a best buy.

Although I am not an expert in cameras or its technicalities, but  photography is my hobby and I found this camera just the right thing to choose off the lot.</Content>

<Content>I just got this camera recently and am very happy with it so far. The pictures are sharp and clear, the zoom is AWESOME!, the video is great and one of the nicest things about it is how lightweight it is! For a camera with video, so many features and such a powerful zoom, I was expecting something big and bulky, but the small size makes it great for travel or carrying in your purse or bag. My other camera is a FujiFilm FinePix F20, which I absolutely LOVE, but its a tiny little camera and the zoom has its limits. Although the picture quality of the FinePix is phenomenal, I wanted something with a better zoom and better quality video ability. I did my research and discovered the Panasonic DMC-FZ28. Some of the features that sold me on it were the Leica lens, multiple picture taking modes, image stabilization and a 486mm zoom in a portable point-and-shoot camera. Im still experimenting with the MANY features this camera offers and have barely scratched the surface of what it can do, but so far, Im VERY impressed and would recommend this camera to someone who wants a lightweight camera with an excellent close-up zoom, clear pictures and great video capability. There are some additional lenses offered for this camera and I will definitely consider them for an ever closer zoom and more options. </Content>

<Content>I had a shoot and point, a Nikon Cool pix 4800.  It took wonderful, clear pictures, but the shutter speed was slow and the shutter itself was sticking.  I purchased the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 almost as soon as it came out to use on a trip and to take pictures of children.  I liked the idea of having more zoom for trips and having a faster shutter speed.  I loved the outdoor pictures that I took on the trip, they were clear and nice, although I think the Nikon pictures were just as good if not better.  The indoor pictures have been very disappointing-usually fuzzy and out of focus. The image stablizer doesnt seem to do its job even though it is supposedly on.  I have read the manual twice and have tried all kinds of settings-nothing has helped.  Once in a while I will get a decent shot, but not very often.  I emailed the company about my concerns three weeks ago, but have received no response.  Dont buy this product!  </Content>

 The HD Video on this camera is amazing.  You cant find many cameras with both a great picture, while also being able to get a nice video quality as well.  This was a great buy, I recommend for anyone trying to just have a nice quality camera before taking a big step into the SLRs.</Content>

<Content>This is my third digital camera.  I still have my Nikon SLR but dont use it anymore.  Digital is the way to go.  But the image quality of my two previous digital cameras wasnt really great.  My previous digital camera was the Panasonic DMC-FZ15 (4 Meg, 12X zoom).  I was thinking of moving up to a DSLR (Cannon or Nikon) but couldnt bring myself to spend that kind of money or have to go back to multiple lenses.  So I read some reviews of the FZ28K and decided to try it since I was reasonably happy with the FZ15 except for the image quality (I do lots of wildlife photos and heavily crop many of my pictures to get closeups).

Well, the FZ28K is WONDERFUL.  The image quality is quite nice.  The zoom is better than advertised.  You can actually get a 32X zoom at 3Meg.  And the image still looks fine.  The color is MUCH better than the FZ15.  The anti-shake is MUCH better too.  The only negatives Ive run across so far (after a few days) is the camera is almost too small, at least for my hands.  And the camera is light.  Again, almost too light.  The manual is TERRIBLE, much worse than the FZ15 manual which only had a little of the translation problems you often see with  Japanese gear.  But, overall, Im very satisfied with this camera and dont expect to be looking for another one for some time.</Content>

<Content>I bought Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28S recently. Initially i was rather doubtful to buy Panasonic. I was strong believer of Canon and Nikon research in cameras. But when i went through reviews of Canon SX10IS, SX100IS, Nikon P80 and Panasonic FZ28S, i decided to go for panasonic for following reasons:
1. Same configuration in low price
2. Better reviews than the Canon and Nikon Cameras in the same range
3. Easy to carry in spite of 18x optical zoom (I did not want SLR.. it is very inconvenient on Hikes. I have used one before)

When i had my first photo session mainly indoor, i was really astonished to see the Intelligent Auto mode of Panasonic FZ28S. It is so powerful that you can actually focus on small objects and blur the rest of the background. It took really good indoor photos in low light. The IA mode selects the correct mode automatically and displays the focus. you can change the focus using AF lock features The portrait mode can even detect faces on the television screen. 

I am yet to explore other features and will post their reviews later.  I ordered Case Logic TBC-4 Camcorder Bag (Black/Grey) for this camera and it fits perfect.

I personally give this camera 5 stars. This is merely a sampling of the high-def video. The still shots and intelligent auto on this camera are amazing and Ive taken several thousand pictures with this camera already. 

If youre in the market for a great CONSUMER-level camera, then this is definitely a choice you should consider. If youre a professional youre probably not even looking at this camera. Keep in mind that the lens selection for this camera is consumer grade. If you are thinking of getting extra lenses and stuff like that, then you need a higher grade camera. This camera deserves 5 stars for the price and function regardless!</Content>

<Content>I had done a lot of research when pondering the upgrade from my trusty Sony. I had initially intended to just go ahead with Sonys DSC-H50/B but after reading lots of reviews about it, and realizing that they have not sorted the Chromatic aberration issue that i oh so well knew with my H2, I had to look elsewhere. This is when i stumbled across the FZ28K. I am happy with my decision, and I must admit that my first time use was a bit disappointing as there are so many different adjustments that can be made with the camera (Im never happy with the full Auto modes although I AM impressed with this models Auto function). I bought it with the Sandisk Ultra III 8GB SDHC card, as by default you cannot take Videos longer that 2GBs in size, and if i wanted to do video Id buy a Camcorder. This time around I opted for a proprietary battery pack as opposed to the rechargeable AA variety. the reason for this i will say is that the regular NiMh rechargables cannot deliver the current required to recharge the flash, so there is a dreadful pause between shooting. but the down side of proprietary packs are that you need the special charger, and of course you can only use the batteries which are intended for the purpose, for this reason I got an extra battery. Im gonna have to sit with the manual and play with it for a few days to acclimatize myself with it. Ill update my review when I get more shooting time.</Content>

<Content>Why should I go into detail on this camera? As always the Panasonic accessories are wanting and expensive, but this camera stands out. 7 shots per second if you can figure out how to do it. Multiple color standards like many cameras. Very intelligent focusing mechanisms. The optics are astonishing, but you will probably want a better lens for closer and further shots. 
You can also get the lenmar batteries that are suggested for this camera. You will probably want the 16 gig minimum SDHC cards. The high-def video can EAT your memory up in no time. However, I can assure you that if you study the manual just a little bit and get to know your camera you will be taking professional shots in no time. This is definitely a great medium between point-and-shoots and DSLRs. </Content>

The 18x zoom was so fantastic that I used the camera instead of binoculars.  The shots taken at 18x zoom look as though they were taken right up close - the autofocus is incredible. After a whole day out on safari the battery was still going strong. The video looks stunning and the anti shake makes it possible to casually film without a tripod. The camera is really light yet durable. I was able to figure out how to use it in an hour without touching the manual. I highly recommend this camera.</Content>

<Content>This is a great point and shoot. It has nice range, it is light, it is easy to operate once you read the manual, it takes great photos. I am a former professional videographer, so the video side of the new cameras doesnt bother me. This camera has enough manual control that you can override the auto exposure, auto focus, auto ISO. 
PROS: Focal range, ease of use, Leica lens, manual controls, joystick manual control, quality of photos including choice of RAW to less resolution, battery charge, price.
CONS: VF resolution, focus hunting in some situations, no tilt LCD screen, lens hood doesnt collapse, no focus ring.
If you want it all, get an SLR. Otherwise, this is it for now.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera to replace our old walk around camera (Sony Cyber-shot DSC-S650 7.2 MP).
I was looking for a camera with a better zoom capability, better indoor picture quality, and higher resolution  video.

I shot over 120 pictures this Thanksgiving (indoors and out) and 4 HD mode videos (indoors and out).
The outdoor pictures were very crisp, true colors in Ai mode, and auto focus was very reliable.  Indoor pictures without a flash, in a well lit room, came out better than expected (in Ai mode) - colors were still true (maybe slightly muted - but still good).  The indoors pictures with flash were very sharp and well lit.

Youll love the autofocus face focus boxes that track your subject (even multiple faces).  Your subject can be on the side of your shot and will still use them as your focal point.  This will allow for depth in your zoom shots.

The video is good, but will not replace a HD camcorder (that was my wish).  The sound in the video is not great and the video playback look slightly jumpy on my kids running around outside.  I still will need to buy a HD video camera (if Santa doesnt bring one - come on Santa :-)

Battery life was great - never moved off the fully charged indication all day (dont buy a spare battery).
SDHC card with 16MB of memory will hold over 4000 pictures in the highest setting (never came close to filling this thing up while even shooting video).

Im very happy with the camera.</Content>

I could not have been more wrong.  The pictures that i have taken are breathtaking.  I have now a Flickr page and there is a whole community there dedicated to this camera, and the pictures made by others are fantastic!!! real gems.  I can not say enough great things about this camera and would reccoment it 100% !!!!!!!!

03/28/09 UPDATE
This camera continues to make me happy .... after months of very heavy usage and including the fact that i now own a very high end SLR camera.  I still use this as the workhorse for my shooting.  It remains the easiest to use and yet can do anything my full SLR camera can do.  This is a very cost effective way to determine if you really want to get into photography as a major hobby.   This is a bridge camera labeled by many and yet the only restrictions it has are the ones that I impose on it through my lack of knowledge... I do not know how it can be topped.  I would without hesitation buy this for anyone in my family.  I suggest strongly that you really read the manual and learn all that this camera has to offer.  It also is making the transition into the full SLR a lot less scary.</Content>

<Content>I thought long and hard before buying this camera. I owned the previous model, the FZ18, and did a lot of research to conclude (or convince myself) that the upgrade was really worth it, and also to find out if there wasnt a better ultrazoom / bridge camera for me. After visiting the forums and reading reviews of the Panasonic and also of the new Nikon, Canon and Fuji ultrazoom models, I concluded that not only was it a valid buy (and gave the FZ18 to my mom, who owns an ancient Olympus camera), but also that the Panasonic was the best bridge camera out there. 

However, it remained to be seen whether my one big gripe with the FZ18 -- shutter lag, read my review at Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ18K 8.1MP Digital Camera with 18x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) if youre interested -- would still be present or if Panasonic had at least minimized it in the new model. 

The FZ28s operation is, of course, very similar to the FZ18s, so for me it was a breeze to set it up. There are only slight button changes in relation to its predecessor, but I found bigger ones in the menus, like more metering and focusing options. I referred to the manual (well organized and very easy to consult) to find the ideal configurations for me. Then I set out to do some test shots.

To my satisfaction, the flying airplane that was in the middle of my frame when I hit the shutter was still in the middle of my frame when I looked at the photos in my computer. This meant that not only had I set the new camera up correctly, but that the shutter lag issue which annoyed me so much in the FZ18 has been drastically improved in the new model. This makes the FZ28 a viable camera for bird shots -- my main use for it -- and I wont be seeing photos of empty blue skies anymore.

Furthermore, despite the small sensor (a characteristic all compact digital cameras share) and increase in resolution, from 8 to 10 MP, image quality has also improved. Shooting at ISO 400, the noise levels have decreased, requiring little or no post-processing in the computer. Image artifacts, like purple fringing, are still present in specific conditions -- such as shooting a dark object against a bright sky -- but much less than before. And the FZ28s handling of low-light situations has also improved considerably.

The incredibly compact and light package still remains, as do the high-quality Leica optics, making the FZ28 a great all-around camera. It has lost a bit in optical zoom, from 506 to 486 mm, because the wide-angle capability has increased (from 28 mm in the FZ18 to 27 mm in the current model), but it doesnt seem to make that much difference overall. And a wider angle is nice in an all-around camera.

Ive taken several hundred shots in all kinds of light and distance situations, and even tried iA, Intelligent Auto, something I rarely did in the previous camera -- I normally shoot in Aperture mode -- to see how well it worked. It gave me some very usable images. So if you dont want to think about the settings and just use the FZ28 as a big zoom point-and-shoot, youll be fine. But tweaking and controling the settings is very easy too.

Battery life is still amazing, but I advise you to get a couple of spare batteries (an original Panasonic or a Digipower will do the job. There are also good reviews on the Lenmar battery, and Ill be giving that one a try). Each photo with the highest resolution and quality is around 4 MB, so several SDHC memory cards are also a good idea. I havent tested the video capabilities yet, but Ill get around to it eventually.

So far, my conclusion is: if I already liked and enjoyed the FZ18 despite its shortcomings, the FZ28 is a promising step up from that.

<Content>Nice Camera, upto 32X optical zoom with lower res.  However, no protector that you can buy just yet. I guess Panasonic is working on it.  Very Lite compare to the SX10.  you have to buy cable for HD viewing, but you view HD on Dual Core computer or fast single.  Pictures are very good.  Menus are easy after a couple of days.  I like the buttons for on and off, and Record and Play.  Manual focus works well.  only problem is the protector lense is not offered just yet from Panasonic.  Pics in JPG and Movies in MOV (QIUCKTIME). Battery seems good (1 week on first charge, still have battery left.  Big menus, Day light viewing seems good. zoom has a nice sound to it. 

yet another fine line between camcorder and Camera.

Loads quickly to Computer.

<Content>This is my third Panasonic Camera. My other two are both Lumix FZ-10. I am inclined towards Landscape and Flowers type of photography. To me, the most important part of a camera is the Lens more than any otherwise. Panasonic use Leica Brand lens on the FZ28 which is built in Japan under strict Leica Supervision. The resolving power of the lens is second to none. Its colour is vivid yet not overwhelming. Its detail presentation is almost impeccable to the finest degree, especially in shadow area. Yes, I agree that photoshop can do amazing things to a picture and can almost turn it 180 degreee around. However, no matter how good an editing software is, it still has to rely on the fundamental information captured by the lens. Only human eyes, created by The Lord, can  outperform the quality and integrity of any lens made by human engineering. Next in line, in my opinion, is Leica Lens. Thank you. </Content>

It has a lot of features that my camera savvy girlfriend loves.  The stablization is a nice feature.

Overall, if you are a simple camera user looking for something more high tec without blowing 600 bucks, pick this camera up.

<Content>Some great benefits of the camera are:
1. Lense range is 27mm unzoomed and up to 486mm zoomed (27mm X 18). To see how this looks with the human eye go to Tamrons website[..]
2. Raw format when not using Auto (uses jpg in auto)
3. Filters attach (it is rare for a camera at this price to have the ability for filters). Use a 46mm UV filter (to protect the lense) and a 46mm polarizer to darken blue skies etc.
4. Image stabalization.
5. 10 mp

I bought this for my wife to use because she does not like using my Canon XTI DSLR, and I wanted something smaller for her. I still have the ability to use many features that I am used to if she asks me to take a picture with the Panasonic. I am not under the illusion that the pictures will be as sharp and clear as my expensive lenses, but its a great bargain at the price.

<Content>Purchased this camera several weeks ago to replace a Sanyo Xacti C6 that failed a while earlier.  The FZ28 is nothing like the Sanyo.  The Sanyo was very small and lightweight and it was extremely simple to use for both pictures and movies.  However, the overall picture/movie quality and low-light performance of the Sanyo was inferior to the FZ28.  I am very pleased with the FZ28; the iA mode setting makes it a simple to use point and shoot camers.  The 18X optical zoom is amazing.</Content>

<Content>I am a review junkie, so I looked at a lot of cameras before deciding on the FZ28, and I am thrilled with this camera!  I am a total beginner, just trying to move up from the point and shoot and I am taking an online photo course, so Im still learning all the capabilities of this camera and which settings work best in each situation (and Ive taken some bad shots because I forgot to re-adjust the settings), but in the automatic mode, Ive taken great snaps, and the video is fantastic compared to my pocket digital.  I wish I realized its harder to get a shallow depth of field with all point and shoot/super zooms versus a slr, Ive seen some fabulous shots online taken with a macro lens attached to the fz28, and I can get good shots at the macro level and with full zoom, but for portraits, I cant get the background nice and fuzzy!  I guess Ill work on my Photoshop skills!  It does make a dslr still on my wish list though.  Otherwise, I love this camera!</Content>

<Content>I am not a pro. This camera is replacing my Canon S2. I still have a lot to learn about it. I have taken it to dog agility shows and the action shots at 7 frames per second are closely competing with what the professional photographers are getting with their thousands of dollars worth of camera equipment. Sunset pictures are gorgeous. I took pictures of butterflies that are incredible in clarity and detail. The battery life is very long. It is easy to start using right out of the box without reading the directions. It is almost hard to take a bad picture. I cant find a single fault with this camera.

<Content>I bought this camera site unseen (other than on the internet) I have been using a Canon G3 for quite some time, and was question not getting another Canon product. The FZ28 is quite a camera. The zoom works great (cant believe Ive been shooting with a 3X this long). The stabilizer is very nice, and the auto focus is quick. There are enough menus to fit pretty much any situation, yet manual enough to enjoy experimenting. The only drawback (as noted by other reviewers) is the lack of a swivel LCD display, and hot shoe. I was impressed by the flash though. Has more than enough light for most shots. As far as weight, I thought it was a store demo and they left out the guts of the camera. Very Light !!</Content>

<Content>this isnt going to be a detailed review, however as a owner of 6 canon powershot cameras including the A640 which I felt was a very good camera, this camera is groovy....yea I am from that era...This camera is lighweight, takes incredible shots, has very fast shutter response, and the Leica lens is fantastic.  I particularily like that I can screw a 46mm filter on without adapters, the being able to zoom out further by reducing the megapixels on the fly, and the image stabilization.  I have shot over 900 shots in a week and only found 4 bad shots.  That is an incredible improvement over my Canons...  I was considering the Canon SX10 which my daughter just bought, but I will tell you with side by side comparisons my pictures were truler to color and the clarity was the same.
The only lost was the hot shoe which the Canon has.  The Leica lens has better low light capability however.  Oh by the way the camera is made in Japan (that is unusual in todays world)Great camera, very happy with it.</Content>

<Content>Ive put off buying a point-n-shoot for the haus frau for one simple reason; I want to be able to enjoy it too!  [Im saving up for a D3]  Enter the Lumix FZ28.  WHOA!  The Leica optics, feature set and ease of use makes this old film dog happy.  Im old school and still havent given up BW film yet but the bw mode along with the instant sepia is way cool.  The anti jiggle though makes feel like Ive been on a bender but thats okay, its a way of telling me to quit being lazy and go get the tripod.  The viewfinder and its diopter adjustments are a godsend for these tired old [50ish] eyes.  The missus digs the video capture feature too.  Low light capacity is first rate too and the optics paired with 10+ megapixels guarantees nice big and sharp blowups.

All in all, Ive been singing the praises of this tool to anyone looking for a high quality and highly capable consumer grade digital camera.  The only thing I wish Id bought along with camera is the ND filters but Ive already remedied that now.  Highly recommended.  Selah.  </Content>

<Content>Panasonic  Lumix DMC-FZ28S 10MP Digital Camera with 18x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)
I began taking scores of photos as soon as the camera arrived and have been completely satisfied with its performance. I use it a lot for nature shots, especially animals, and find the 18X exceptionally effective. My HAND-HELD SHOTS AT FULL 18 X zoom are amazing - strong testimony to Panasonics image stabilization. My assessment now is that this may be the last camera I will need. Worth the full 5 stars!</Content>

<Content>My wife and I have shot a lot of photos through the years using slrs and quality lenses. Gave my wife a fuji digital camera a few years ago and were hooked. From close-ups of flowers to distant shots of national park scenic wonders, that little camera was awesome. But a couple of drops made it more and more difficult to use. My wife wanted just an updated version of that camera she had come to love. However, I did some consumer research and came upon this Panasonic Lumix and read the reviews. Thought Id take a chance of upsetting my wife and replace her beloved camera with this product. She loves it (as do I)! It is so much more versatile and allows for more options than come with most slrs. If you just want to point and shoot, it takes great photos. If you want to venture out for more special effects or a particular lighting option, this one will do it. If you want to zoom in while shooting on video mode, this one will do it. The only criticism we have is that some of the controls seem to be too crowded. If it were me, I would have designed that a little differently, but that is a minor issue. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that we have only had it a few weeks and dont want to give a final judgment until we have put it through all the rigors. But from where we sit at this point, if you want versatility and want to lug around just one camera that can take tight wide angle shots, zoom in on wildlife and scenic wonders, experiment with some cool lighting, or just shoot a few seconds of quick video, so far, this camera does it all with pleasing results.</Content>

<Content>My first Panasonic Lumix was purchased several years ago; I bought their second ultra zoom model available in the US.  The camera was heavy and bulky, but, oh, did it ever take great photographs! Because I travel for pleasure several times a year, I decided that I would be more comfortable with a point and shoot camera, a Canon. Somewhere along the line I sold the Lumix, and Ive regretted it ever since.

When I got back from Alaska a few weeks ago, I decided that I would begin anew my bi-yearly camera research.  I was prepared to purchase a DSLR, but when I came upon the Lumix DMC-FZ28, I could not resist.  It took me almost three weeks of intensive research and driving myself crazy before I took the plunge and bought the silver model.

I am very happy to report that I am in the processing of getting to know my new FZ28.  While its not as compact as my old Canon, my new Lumix is going to be easy to travel with.  Happily, its not as heavy as my first Lumix, and it is not nearly as bulky.  I am so pleased to have a super zoom camera again, I just love landscapes and whale watching -- what better way to photograph them than with an FZ28?  One of the reasons why I didnt buy a DSLR is because I love movie mode, and while newer DSLRs are beginning to incorporate that feature, they have a long way to go before Im going to spend the kind of money on a camera that I wouldnt like as much as I like (love) my FZ28.

Manual controls are very important to me, and so is an optical viewfinder.  The FZ28 has both.  The quality of my photos thus far are superior to even my old 35mm.  This camera will make a great holiday present to yourself or someone you love.  Im going to MX in April, and I cant wait to along bring my new traveling camera.  </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera in lieu of spending the extra money on a digital SLR. I had several reasons for this, not the least of which being the fact that digital SLRs add so many new features and enhancements to their quality each year while dropping in price. The notion of investing a good $700 or more on something that will be quickly replaced by a much more powerful model within only a year or two just didnt sit well with me. So in my search for something to get me a step up from totally novice point and shoot photography, the superzooms looked like a good option. I will eventually purchase a digital SLR, but my advice to anyone who is uncertain if theyre willing to part with that much money just yet is to wait it out. Look at some of the models from only three or four years ago - they offered an average of around 7 or 8 megapixels, lacked features like image stabilization and live view LCD, and cost a few hundred dollars more than todays units. I know that if I had invested a good thousand dollars into something that is noticeably less powerful and feature laden than todays units costing hundreds less, I might be kicking myself pretty hard. 

This unit may be just a point and shoot but it has one of the best lenses available. It is almost comparable to an SLR in many respects. It shoots in RAW mode as well as offering one of the longest zooms in its class. I would have wished it offered a lower minimum ISO than 100 (my old Canon Powershot A610 compact offers a 50 setting) but with such a high quality CCD, the long zooming Leica lens and twice the megapixels of my old Canon it seemed a far trade off when all things were considered.

The features and modes are quite numerous and of very good quality. They do well to guide even the most inexperienced users to get some great shots in various situations. I have to especially praise the intelligent auto mode above all others when it comes to beginners usage. The camera does a surprisingly effective job at recognizing the situations in which it finds itself. (One gripe I have with this setting however is that it doesnt allow you to shoot in RAW format - its JPEG only - more on that later.) Being more of a photo geek than the average person, I use the manual setting most often; and its a true manual setting rather than semi-manual like many other manufacturers offer. I have full control of everything just like on an SLR. One of the features I liked best while shooting in the manual mode is that the cameras metering is active and gives you feedback for the best setting. Say for example your shutter speed or your aperture needs to be raised or lowered - the cameras meter will show that as youre focusing. Following this electronic advice gives near perfect exposures every time; but youre still free to make your own creative judgments since it is a manual mode.

The menus are relatively easy to navigate considering the amount of settings and options available. I also really liked that I could choose between 4:3, 3:2, and 16:9 aspect ratios (SDTV, 35mm film, and widescreen TV respectively.)  The HD video option is a nice little extra - but keep in mind you only get about eight minutes of video on that setting regardless of how large your memory card is. Then again I figure if shooting video is a priority you would buying a proper video camera. The image stabilization works very well as do the higher ISO settings should you find yourself wanting to take a shot in the dark without a tripod. Of course you shouldnt expect to make artist grade compositions in conditions like that, but if you need to snap a quick picture of something in low light it will serve you well. Im actually excited to see what the future holds as technology improves upon the image stabilizing and the noise reduction at higher ISO speeds. Hopefully in a few years we will start to see models that shoot some very impressive images in low light conditions. As far as long shutter speeds if using a tripod, this unit offers up a full minute. I was able to take a close up shot of a rose last night in only the light of a waning moon, and it come out so bright I actually had to darken it a little in the post processing just because I wanted it to have a night time effect.

Physically speaking, this unit feels solid and employs good ergonomics. It is relatively lightweight but does pack some bulk and volume. (Dont expect to be pocketing this for everyday, everywhere random use - but that isnt the purpose of a superzoom or an SLR.) It fits nicely in the hands and has a very polished, professional appearance. Essentially it is a Panasonic SLR body with a fixed lens. Get yourself a nice bag and a few extras and you will have a very respectable hobbyist level outfit. 

The superzoom (18x) is wonderful. Last night I took a picture of the moon and it came out very detailed and clear. It certainly helped that the lens is threaded for 46mm filters - allowing me to use a polarizer. The autofocus system also had no trouble at all which surprised me. I thought I was going to have to manually focus an object so far away and bright. I havent yet been able to use the long zoom for things like bird photography but I have seen images taken by other users and it seems they are quite good. 

But now the most important thing when it comes to investing in a camera like this: image quality. I hate having to say it, but I wasnt as impressed with the FZ28s JPEG images as I had hoped to be. I might have been spoiled by the super sharp, low noise imaging of my A610 at ISO 50, but for my money the FZ28 didnt measure up to that old Canon. The images were slightly soft, maybe a little jagged at close examination. Taking macro pictures of my corals, I noticed some artifacts that werent present on the older images from my Canon. I was really hoping for tack-sharp details but didnt get them. The colors werent as saturated as the Canons, but at the same time many might welcome that fact because it gives greater post processing control, especially owing to the RAW format capability.

This is where the FZ28 really shines. After being a little disappointed in the JPEG processing (a bit too aggressive on noise reduction seems to be the problem making the images too soft) I tried the RAW format and started getting the results I wanted. Straight from the camera (SilkyPIX Developer comes with the package and does a decent job) the images were near perfect. Just a little bit of processing and then an export to either a TIFF (lossless) and/or JPEG (lossy) and I have some truly great pictures. RAW format will take up quite a bit of space on your memory card but these days memory is inexpensive so carrying a few 4g or 8g cards should not set you back too much, and considering the type of camera this is Im assuming that anyone looking into its purchase would be concerned enough with the quality of their images that the extra investment is already being considered.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this unit to anyone looking to step up from their compact point and shoot digital camera to something a little more professional. While being a fixed lens unit and not entirely on par with the better SLR models, it certainly offers a very effective step in their direction for a far more reasonable price tag. Unless youre a professional or very advanced hobbyist who absolutely needs an SLR, this may be about one of the best camera choices on the market at this time. Naturally one can not future-proof themselves when it comes to digital technology, but the reasonable price of superzooms compared with SLRs makes a compelling case at this point in time. So until SLRs are closer to this price level (and they will be, albeit with more features, megapixels, and image quality than todays units) my advice is to go superzoom. Speaking for myself I would be a lot less disappointed to see something I bought for $300 or less go obsolete than I would something for which I paid upwards of $700. Canon and Nikon also have units in this class getting some great reviews. Its all a matter of choice I suppose. I went with a Panasonic, though Im sure I would have been quite happy with the others as well.


Pros - Likely best lens quality in its class, 18x zoom, threads to use filters, great array of shooting modes, intelligent auto is wonderful for effortless use, manual mode offers full user control, great image quality in the RAW format, SilkyPIX included, professional look and feel. SLR-like capabilities at a point and shoot price point.

Cons - Noise reduction is a little too aggressive when it comes to in-camera image processing for JPEG format resulting in images that are a little soft and can appear a little frayed. No RAW format in auto mode. Some users may find the images less saturated than they would want. (But this is easily changed in post processing.)</Content>

<Content>No doubt, I love this Camera which I am still waiting for.

I placed an order for FZ28k in Amazon website thinking that amazon being a well-known company will be responsibly handling my order and deliver the ordered item on time. But unfortunately my experience was different. They charged the amount on my credit card and after sent a mail to me that my bank is declining the transaction. I called Bank of America to verify this claim. BOA has told that the transaction is approved and Amazon has tried to make multiple transaction of same amount. I tried to sort out this issue by calling Amazon customer representatives who are in India. They told me there is no record about the transaction they made with my credit card, with them. Now my credit card company has told me to ask Amazon to cancel the transaction. I called up Amazon regarding this, now they are saying they will investigate the issue and after some days they will let me know if they can do anything regarding the problem I am facing.
I am not trying to say amazon is a fake company, but I made a mistake by placing the order through Amazon even though better offers are there in BH and JR, thinking that these are small companies and no trustworthy as Amazon.
Now I realize that I should have better gone for a smaller company than a bigger one like Amazon which is fully in a mess and dont keep any track of what they are doing.

My order was for a Panasonic FZ28K Camera, aCamera bag, a Memory stick, a Memory reader and a small tripod. They split this order into two different shipments (Against my preference of sending all items together when available), one with the Camera and the other with rest of the items in the order. The company site shows that shipment which doesnt include Camera is in transit with the carrier(USPS). When I checked with the USPS tracking site it shows that Amazon has just informed them about the item to be shipped, not actually shipped.

Maybe the experience is unique to me :(. be careful with this giant who is now arrogantly careless about their customers credit card data.</Content>

<Content>I have olympus C5550. I wanted to upgrade it and was in the market for sometime. After reading quite a lot of reviews here and on dpreview.com, I finally decided DMC-FZ28 is the right one for my needs and budget. And I am glad I made the right decision. Great camera w/ incredible features. The picture quality is just amazing. I also recorded few video clips and they were pretty good. I used them to upload to youtube. Love this video feature so that I can shoot my kids short video and post them on youtube for my folks to watch. It has so many features that I still didnt get a chance to explore all of them. I guess its time to make a trip :-)

BTW, can someone please recommend a good camera case that can fir this camera and its accessories? I got this camera case : http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16830994096 but it does not fit in it.

<Content>The FZ28 is one of the best digital cameras Ive ever used. Its user friendly, the manual is clear for the more complex functions, its loaded with features and has an incredible 78x digital zoom (18x optical). Id been gimping along using an old Olympus for years (although it did its job admirably) and finally buckled to get a new one, because although I prefer using film and a darkroom, my bank account doesnt. After a ton of research, I settled on this camera and Ive never regretted it. Normally Im a bit of a Canon purist, but the Canon equivalent was blown out of the water with this one. Id recommend it to everyone from beginners to photographers like myself. </Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera as an update from my beloved Canon S2, which had served me well for 3 years and taught me the basics of using the manual features of a bridge camera.  I consider myself a camera enthusiast, taking photos of mostly my travels and my children.  I originally planned to upgrade my S2 to the newest S-model being released by Canon.  I was so excited when the Canon SX10 was announced and had actually even preordered one online before I realized that it would not accept a polarizing lens.  During a recent trip to Hawaii, I had fallen in love with my polarizer and couldnt see paying $500 for a camera that wouldnt allow use of additional lenses.  I thought about upgrading to a DSLR but decided that I wouldnt like the bigger camera and expense.  Online reviews pointed me to the FZ28, and I couldnt be more pleased with my purchase.

The camera offers a variety of very good presets as well as full manual controls.  Noise levels are very good, even at higher ISO speeds than my previous camera would accommodate.  Overall, I agree wholeheartedly with all of the reviews previously posted, so I wont bore you with restating what has already been stated.  I did want to provide a bit of information for those of you who may be interested in using add-on lenses for your FZ28, as I dont think this has really been covered much yet in the reviews.  Unlike my previous camera which required an adapter tube AND an additional lens cap to accept a UV or polarizing filter, the FZ28 has threads on the end of the lens tube itself to accept a 46 mm lens.  The lens screws directly onto the cameras lens, extending and retracting as the camera is used.  It essentially becomes part of the camera.  Therefore, there is no need to buy extra adapter parts or lens caps in order use either of these filters with the FZ28.  When you turn off the camera, the add-on lens slides into the camera and can be covered with the cameras regular lens cap.  (As a side note, I understand that Lensmate is releasing an adapter that works with the lens hood for the Canon SX10 very soon, but its still an additional expense and a separate piece to be used with the camera rather than becoming part of the camera like the FZ28 model.  Having personally used both a Canon separate adapter and the FZs built-in threads, I much prefer the convenience of the FZ models threaded lens.)  Teleconverter and macro lenses are also available for the FZ28 if desired, although I dont anticipate needing either for my own use.   

The pictures I have taken have been sharp and colorful, even in less than idea lighting conditions.  Even photos taken through a double-paned window at a distance were detailed (see bird and berries photo in customers images on this site).  I havent had an opportunity to use the video components yet.

In summary, this is a great camera offering beautiful photos and seemingly foolproof options.  I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a small camera with big potential!

<Content>I am an amateur that shoots mainly four things... nature scenes, macro plants and insects, running and playing dogs, and dog still portraits. I got this camera looking for two things... I wanted the extended optical zoom and I wamted to shoot infocus photos of my dogs running that were large enough for me to crop and still print 8 x 10s with.  I have owned and still own several digital point and shoots as well as the Rebel Xti, and each has its own special use for my shooting purposes, however a stop action point and shoot and a good zoom were missing.  Reviews said this might be the camera for both. I hoped this camera would be the go between for the pocket point and shoots and the DSLR.  Got this camera yesterday, shot 200 photos with it on a fairly dark, cloudy day, and I LOVE it.  Its fast, crystal clear with the great Leica lens, and the zoom is all its advertised to be and more.  Exposure couldnt have been better.  I mostly used the intelligent Auto mode, but did play around with some other settings just to learn about the camera. Only two problems... I had a bit of a problem with the camera telling me something was in focus and it wasnt when I reviewed the photo...and, I kept missing the running dogs since the camera fired just before they came fully into view... guess that is positive and means its faster than I realize???  Both these problems will resolve with more use of the camera I am sure.  I would also prefer an automatic pop-up flash rather than this one that I have to physically open to use.  Guess I am spoiled about that???  All in all, despite its light weight and cheap feel, this camera promises to be exactly what I was looking for.  Would I recommend it??  In a minute, in fact I already have to several friends!!!</Content>

<Content>We bought the camera as a step between point and shoot simplicity and SLR confusion. Turns out it works pretty well as both. You can set your own settings and have the camera remember them or you can fiddle and tweak to your hearts content. The bottom line though is, unless youre actually *trying* to screw it up, you almost cant! Even pictures Ive taken with the camera screaming, I am *NOT* responsible for the poor quality youre about to recieve! Have turned out fairly remarkable. My first pics were of a pre-sunrise; quarter moon hovering with just a hint of lightness on the eastern horizon. The moon came very clean for *not* having a tripod.

Our first thought when we ordered the FZ28 was that wed hang on to the point and shoot Kodak as a snap shot camera. Turns out the FZ28 handles that so easily Ive retired the Kodak and am thinking seriously about buying *another* FZ28 for my husband... I just *hate* to share. :-P

<Content>I bought this camera because I like the way that the Panasonic camera operates. I currently own a DMC-FZ7 and it has served me well for over 2 years. I thought I would upgrade to the FZ28 for the increased zoom length and 10 megapixel ccd. However, what Panasonic doesnt make clear is that the zoom extension is on the lower end of the focal range. The zoom range on the high end is still the same (35 mm equivalent of 468 mm)as that of the FZ7 with the 12 power zoom. Its a great camera, easy to use but Im disappointed over the zoom range.</Content>

<Content>I was sitting the fence for a while: FZ28? SX10? P80? FH20? SX1?
Finally, I bought FZ28, and I am extremely pleased.
SX1 and FH20 probably would meet my expectations better (CMOS rather than CCD), but SX1 is not sold in the US, and FH20 is double the price of (and SX1 would be same if sold around here).

I replaced S1 IS that I liked a lot, so my first impression with FZ28 was that it was so light that the plastic must be cheap. Thats actually not the case; its light but solid.

I would prefer AA batteries, but I can live with Panasonics choice (especially that Lenmar has a cheap and presumably excellent replacement). After taking 50 or so pictures, playing with the settings for several hours, taking 10 30 seconds or so movies, the battery indicator hardly moved left, so I expect that the reports on the very efficient energy management are confirmed.

The LCD is bright, but I prefer using viewfinder. Switching is convenient and easy. The only complain I have is the glossy surface, but I applied a screen. This is a preference, I guess; I always install matte screen on anything glossy (like my iPhone, iMac, PowerBookPro).

BTW, while on Mac topics, software for Macs is included. The camera works with my Mac with no problem. The videos are in QuickTime (.mov) format, so I like it too.

I like the menu system on FZ28 much more than on Canons (we own/owned a few PowerShot models). Its really easy to play with customizing pre-built photo settings on FZ28 if you want to experiment beyond the iA.

The photos that I took under a variety of conditions are excellent (I settled for highest resolution with 16:9) -- as far as my completely amateur senses are concerned. Video is also great in HD 720p, and I do not have a problem with sound. My AppleTV does not do any better than 720p, so for now I am fine. The 2GB video limit (~9 minutes) does not bother me at all, since I use the video feature on a camera only for very short clips.

No hesitation with giving the camera 5 stars.

I also bought (and recommend after a lot of research, especially with the case):
- Tamrac 3320017 Aero 20 Digital Camera Zoom Case (Black)
- Lenmar DLP006 Lithium-ion Digital Camera/Camcorder Battery Equivelent to the Panasonic CGR-S006A Battery
- 2 x Transcend TS8GSDHC6 8GB SDHC card (SD 2.0 SPD Class 6)</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera as an upgrade from an earlier version, and I couldnt be more happy with it.  This is everything I was looking for in a camera, and it is very easy to use too!  When I bought my previous Panasonic camera, I was not sure what to expect, but now that I have owned 2 and they have both been great, I would recommend Panasonic to anyone.  The HD video mode on this camera is awesome too.  Panasonic hit a home run with this camera, you wont be disappointed with this camera!  </Content>

<Content>If you have not yet owned an ultrazoom (10X or higher), you will probably like the FZ28. Its a nice camera, smaller and lighter than my Sony, but loaded with features and options.

In the past 6 years, I have owned 3 or 4 digital cameras. One or two years ago, I bought a Sony DHC-H5, primarily for its 12X zoom, which was a stunning improvement over the 10X I previously owned. I was one click away from buying the Sony DHC-H50 when I started reading rave reviews about the Panasonic Lumix FZ28. A bit of research convinced me to buy it from Amazon. In less than 24 hours, I returned it. (I admit I should have given it more time, but my basic disappointment would not have changed.)

There is a gotcha in comparing zooms. A 12X is not necessarily 20% better than a 10X. The X factor is based on the unzoomed wide angle lens. The FZ28 has a much wider lens than the H5. On the plus side, the FZ28 will capture more of the scene before you because of that wide lens. However, that wide angle lens means 18X isnt as much of a zoom as one might think.

To truly compare lenses, you must look at the 35mm equivalents for each lens. The 18X FZ28 zoom maxes to 486mm; the 15X H50 is 465mm. Both should reach farther than the 12X H5 at 432mm. But in careful testing, taking pictures from the same spot with the FZ28 and the H5, the zoom shots were virtually identical. (Actually, the H5s auto mode captured a brighter image than the FZ28, but the zooms were undistinguishable.) Because of the vagaries of the X factor, I didnt expect a huge improvement, but I still expected to be wowed and I was not. And by not being wowed, I was disappointed, even though this zoom will wow anyone who hasnt used another long zoom.

I considered hanging on to the FZ28. It has many newer features lacking on my older H5, such as face detection and smile detection. Unfortunately, the LCD is smaller and less sharp than the H5.

The tipping point was a rather minor feature, ironically. Most cameras record JPEGs, which is fine for most uses. A lot of high-end cameras shoot RAW format, which stores much more information than a JPEG. That info can be very useful in a powerful photo editor. Frankly, I crop and make minor tweaks that work fine in JPEG format. But, the fact that the FZ28 offers RAW + JPEG (one shot, two pix) tipped me towards the FZ28. And back again.

You cannot shoot RAW if you use the fully automatic mode (Intelligent Assist). I cant understand why that is so, but it is true. So, if you want RAW, you forego auto and vice versa. Crazy. Unacceptable to me, as minor as my interest in RAW is.

Im not trying to steer anyone away from the FZ28 except for someone like me who is trying to pick between it and another camera and is swayed by the 18X zoom and RAW format. Make sure you have other reasons for buying the FZ28.

<Content>I needed to replace my PS camera and after doing a lot of reading I narrowed it down to the Lumix Z28 and the Cannon G10 and SX10IS (since I could not get my hands on a Cannon SX1IS).  I use a Nikon DSLR for most Important things but It is too bulky when I travel or vacation and also my wife finds it hard to use. I also wanted to be able to shoot video that was at least decent so I would only have to lug around one camera so it was a must to be able to zoom while shooting video as well.

My first choice was the Pannisonic FZ28, it seemed to have everything I was looking for however, after one day of shooting it was obvious that there were some major problems such as CONSTANTLY WONDERING AF WHILE SHOOTING VIDEO, INABILITY TO TRACK FOCUS WHILE SHOOTING VIDEO, WASHED OUT SHOTS (stills) and a few other operational and menu issues that were unacceptable. I.E. face recognition was on when menu said it was off, zoom reversed. 

That left the two Cannon cameras.  I chose the SX10IS over the G10 due to the fact that the G10 WILL ONLY DO A DIGITAL ZOOM WHILE SHOOTING VIDEO Yes, The optical zoom does not work for video.  I see this as a deal breaker for me since digital zooms add far too much noise to the immage to be usable.  Plus, the added focal length, cost diff. and articulated VF on the SX10IS influenced me as well.  Too bad about the G10 since I really want to like it.  Only down side to the SX10IS is no ability to do RAW format.  Hope there will be a hack to fix that in the future. </Content>

<Content>You cant beat this camera. It goes from 27mm wide to all the zoom you could need. It is lightweight,  and has a Leica lens. As a professional photographer, I like simplicity. This camera is tops. My second Panasonic Dmz Fz series camera and I recommend it for anyone who doesnt want to lug around heavy cameras, but still can get shots that can compete with the best of them. And dollar for dollar, Id say it is probably the best buy around.</Content>

<Content>Ive taken several pictures.  The zoom works well; I get nice pictures with the camera set to 3MP (=~1.5MB/photo), which allows a 32.1x zoom. The minor annoyances: 
1) The filenames of the photos cant seem to be set to the date taken (they are sequentially numbered)
2) video mode is on the opposite side of the dial from the intelligent autofocus (annoying because these are my two favorite modes).  
3) The video files are so big that my older computer (Inspiron 6000 laptop) cant play them back smoothly (I may need to lower the resolution for video)</Content>

<Content>Ive had this camera for about a month now, and am thoroughly in love with it.  I love the huge zoom and the more than adequate wide angle.  I love how quickly it powers up, and cycles between shots.  I love how long the battery lasts.  I love the quality of the shots with the Leica lens.  I love how easily the zoom lens (the zooming speed can be adjusted to match the users desires) precisely travels.

The camera has a plastic body, and probably wouldnt handle being dropped real well.  Im not sure about the construction of similar class offerings by Olympus, Canon, etc.  But the camera seems to be pretty well-made in terms of the motor and computer.  I get the sense that if I treat it well, it will treat me well.

My research led me to believe that I would get the best quality pictures with the easiest interface - at the best price to boot! - with this camera (of any super zoom).  So far I havent been disappointed.</Content>

<Content>Purchased this camera after doing research on super zooms, viewing several models and reading reviews of the Panasonic FZ18 which it replaced.   The FZ18 received top super zoom ratings in several reviews.  A key factor for me was the 27mm wide angle zoom; I have found 28mm wideangle a very useful feature for family, architecture and landscape pictures on my 35mm SLR. The FZ28 promised improvements to the FZ18 in image processing and high definition video with zoom.   I have used the camera for about a month and I am very pleased with its performance.   Image stabilization is superb--I have been able to take clear pictures at maximum zoom in low light.   Pictures in a variety of lighting conditions have been very pleasing.   Resolution is very good.   As reviews of FZ18 discussed, the small sensor displays noise in low lighting, high ISO, but I find it not objectionable in pictures that I have taken(family photo album).   This camera will replace my 35mm SLR, several lenses for the SLR and a camcorder as a light weight and versatile travel companion.   The Silkypix software bundled with the camera is a very capable and easy to use photo enhancement product--there is a bit of learning curve, but after some experimentation and learning I find it easy to use and it has produced excellent results. </Content>

<Content>Great pics, great HD movies, just make sure you get a BIG memory card.  Also, the HD movies are good quality, but require a newer computer to view correctly.  I have a 2 GHz G5 iMac, and the video skips a bit.  However the camera encodes it, it appears to require more processing power than my G5 can do.  Ive replayed the video from multiple starting points, and it doesnt skip in the same places, so it doesnt appear to be an encoded skip, rather my Mac is having a tough time replaying that level of video, in the way the camera encodes it.

<Content>I have had my FZ28 for about 3 weeks now and I am very happy with it. This is an extremely versatile camera with very good image quality. The highpoint of the camera for me is the huge zoom range it is capable of. The image stabilization works wonders at full telephoto (18x), and sharp, hand held shots in average light are very possible, if not routine.

So far I have taken mostly outdoor landscape, and full zoom photos of wildlife. The landscape images are sharp and well exposed. I had a little more trouble with the full telephoto wildlife shots as many of these were taken in less than full sunlight conditions resulting in less sharpness and less color saturation than I like. I was able to do some post processing and improve many of them, though. Im hoping as I use the camera more my technique will improve and I can get sharper telephoto shots.

I also had the opportunity to use my FZ28 at a dimly lit coffee house to shoot some video and stills of a friend playing live acoustic guitar. I really wasnt able to get any infocus stills because I didnt want to use a flash and disturb the performer or the other patrons during the performance. I did take about 7 minutes total of high def video by placing the camera on the table in front of me. I was very pleased with the results. Fairly smooth video capture and decent sound considering how little light was available. I am going to make a DVD of the videos for my friend.

I have also shot some macro photos with impressive results. This thing focuses so close it is like having a 10MP microscope! My friend asked me to take an extreme close up of his eyeball (weird, I know). His ophthalmologist has got nothing on these photos! They are amazing. I converted the photo to black and white and cropped it super close for him. He has it as his desktop background on a 22 monitor! Very striking.

The reason I didnt give this camera five stars is there is a fair amount of noise present in all photos even at low ISO settings. I have a large format 13 x 19 printer so I am more aware than most people of the effects of noise on a large printed photo. I have to do a fair amount of software smoothing (which results in a loss of detail) to be able to print clean photos at that size.

In addition to the noise problem, I also have had some issues with recording video with the camera (or subject) in motion. If I slowly walk around my apartment taking video in average daylight the camera has a very hard time following the motion and staying in focus, especially if I zoom in and out some. I love the HD video option but I am disappointed the output isnt a little better. Also, it is important to buy the fastest SD card you can afford. I have an A-Data 8GB Class 6 Turbo SDHC card (cheap: $17.50) and I have had the camera stop after recording about 45 seconds of HD video, and give me an error message saying my card is not fast enough to keep up with the video capture. This only happens occasionally and I think it must depend on what you are taking the video of. I didnt have any trouble taking video at the dimly lit coffeehouse but I got these errors outdoors at full zoom while taking a video of a seagull having a snack.

Even with those 2 problems I heartily recommend this camera, and from what I have read it is the best in the long zoom consumer camera category. </Content>

<Content>Im not quite sure why there are only 3 reviews for the silver Lumix FZ28 and 22 for the black model at the time of this writing. I debated over which one to get myself and ended up choosing the silver. After looking at both of the models on the Panasonic website, I found that the controls on the back of the silver model are much easier to see. When I got it in the mail and opened it up, I wasnt disappointed. The silver camera is just beautiful! I own a Canon sd870, which I love and keep in my handbag at all times since it is so small. I was in the market for something with more manual control and a greater zoom. I didnt want a DSLR because of the price and having to purchase and carry around additional lenses. This camera fits the bill.Im not going to repeat all the features that this camera has since they are all listed on this page for you to read for yourself. I love the fact that you can set this camera to IA mode and get great pictures without really having to think about any settings, but you would be doing yourself a disservice to always use this camera that way. I purchased several books here on Amazon about digital photography (The Joy of Digital Photography by Jeff Wignall being one of them) and along with the camera manual, I have learned quite a lot about the many great features this camera has (I have even taken some RAW pictures and then adjusted them using the included software-they came out great). I also invested in a decent tripod - you can get much better shots using the zoom if the camera is steady. The pictures I have been getting with this camera are vibrant and beautiful. There is so much more to this camera than a point and shoot and with so much to still discover about it, I dont see myself getting bored with this camera anytime soon. I highly recommend this camera. Now if I just didnt have to wait another 3 months for my vacation to give it a good workout.... </Content>

<Content>HI.
I started out years ago with FZ10 then to FZ15, FZ20(2), FZ7, FZ30, FZ50, last month i accidently dropped my FZ50 in the water on my trip in Thailand on a canoe trip, its now malfunction, SO!, i need a new FZ!!
i came to the newly FZ28, i bought it about 10 days ago, with no surprise, FZ28 is smallest in FZ series that ive owned, but it packs with heavy fearures, the wide angle at 27mm i really need, the tele at farther at 486mm is needed too. Still got LEICA lens at f2.8, great!!
WELL, i shot about 500 shots already, it produces nice pictures as its brothers, with lesser noise, i have shot at 1600iso too, very useable images with some noise reduction in CS3. 
Images still razor sharp, clean and bright. I do use custom white balance 1  2, 1 i set for outdoors, 2 i set for indoor.very happy with the results. Amazing small camera that does it all, excepts it does not have external flash, i missed that hotshoe mount.
The lens hood is too big for the body size, it will block some of the popup flash, so you need to remove the hood before use the pop up flash.
A great everyday camera and for travel.
I paid 312$ here thru Amazon, good deal..
Dont think twice, buy it!!!

<Content>Very sharp lens and takes filters. Exceptional ability to lock focus even on extended telephoto and, in my case, on a moving platform ( a lobster boat in Maine ) The IA feature is also extremely effective  - having been a manual film camera user, then a SLR and DSLR user I do not recall ever having left a camera on automatic - this was a first for me. Exposure compensation through a dedicated button was also helpful - indeed the use of dedicated buttons for a number of functions, in addition to the usual menu access made me feel quite at home.   Good work Panasonic.</Content>

<Content>The camera was purchased from Vanns through Amazon. It was exactly as advertised, in its original packaging, and arrived in perfect condition and on schedule. Vanns kept me apprised via 3 emails of its progress at every step with the 3rd email providing access to complete tracking information. 
This was a replacement for a Panasonic DMC-FZ8K Camera whch I have used for about 2 years and which performed well for me. The FZ28K is the third and newest model in the series and offers many improvements which I am now enjoying. It has a very impressive set of features which allow virtually complete control of picture-taking but will do it all for you if youre in a hurry with its point-and-shoot mode labeled iA (or intelligent Auto) mode.        </Content>

<Content>As noted in the title, I already own the FZ-18, but when I saw some of the enhancements in the FZ28, I decided to give it a try since I had been so happy with the FZ-18.  One of the greatest improvements is the resolution of the viewfinder LCD.  I feel the camera is more stable, especially at long focal lengths, using the viewfinder LCD, and thus, holding the camera close to my face.  The new viewfinder has significantly more resolution, and it actually feels like you are looking through an SLR viewfinder.  The higher megapixel resolution is also a plus, and it further brings out the crispness of the Leica lens, which has always been spectacular.  I have also enjoyed using the automatic backlighting adjustment and the ability to set a limitation on the cameras automatic selection of ISO.

I have friends with digital SLRs, and occasionally they show me a picture that I simply could not take, but for the most part, my camera easily challenges theirs in all lighting, focusing and fast picture taking situations.

The FZ-18 I got is black, so I decided to go with silver for the FZ-28, and its very nice looking.  My only complaint at all with these cameras, and its both a positive and a negative, is that they feel so light.  I guess we associate heft with quality, so the light weight of the camera makes them feel a little cheap, but it also makes them easier to carry.  You hardly know its hanging on your shoulder.

I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a lot of control, a spectacular lens and a huge range of photo taking features.  I did lots of research before buying either of these cameras, and they are head and shoulders above the Canon, Nikon and Sony competitors.</Content>

<Content>After many hours of research and reading many blogs and reviews, I decided this camera was the one for me.  I previously owned an Olympus ultra-zoom and knew the ultra-zoom category was where I felt comfortable for an everyday camera.  I was looking for a camera that takes SLR quality pictures but  is smaller and lighter so I can take it with me in my purse.  The FZ28 lives up to the great reviews.  Ive owned the camera about a month so I will post a more in-depth review in the future.  Here are the things Ive noticed so far: 
 
(+) Very easy to learn and use, manual was actually very helpful  
(+) Intelligent mode is very smart  
(+) Takes sharp photos in quick motion  
(+) Low noise in my indoor pictures, especially compared to my Olympus  
(+) Outstanding quality for the price - most pics rival my dads D200, I spent $1000 less  
(-) I havent found anything negative about the camera yet

My camera came with a lens cap, lens strap, camera strap, lens hood  adapter ring (for taking pictures in bright sun), battery, USB cable, and AV cables for hooking up to a TV.  I purchased it soon after the camera was released in August through Vanns on Amazon.  There was a shipping issue with UPS  Vanns was top-notch - their customer service was very helpful and quick to respond to fix the situation.

<Content>As many people said before me, this camera is great! I received it from OneCall a few day ago in perfect condition for a low price. It was new in the box and was delivered right on time. Trying on this camera was a similar experience. It is great! 
    I am not a professional photographer, I just like to have a versatile camera that can do it all. First off, it has great picture quality in most given conditions. I made most of my pictures inside of my house to test low light conditions and it handled it well. Previous cameras I used always made pictures with yellow tints from indoor light. FZ28 has a party and indoor portrait mode which can eliminate that. And if that is not it enough there are manual settings that can be tweaked in every way. 

IA MODE:    Perhaps the greatest part of this camera is the intelligent auto mode. It is the best one I have ever seen. I would say, 9 out of 10 using IA were perfect. Its not 100%, but what is? 

FOCUS:     I am also very impressed with the focusing abilities of this camera. It is very good considering the 18x zoom. Sometimes is takes a little bit to focus well, but once it does it is great.

MOVIE:    The movie mode is very good on this camera. It is high quality and there are 5 different quality setting. To use HD make sure you have a fast SD card.  

SIZE:     It is clear that you will not be able to fit this camera into your pocket. However, it depends how much size means to you. Personally it took me a long time to decide to get this camera and I am surprised that it is actually very small for its parameters. It gives A LOT for its size. So I suggest if you have somewhat of an issue with size but really want a lot for that sacrifice. Buy the camera. Its really not so good to carry a camera in a pocket anyway.

OUTDOOR PICTURES:  WOW. WOW. WOW. Outdoor, sunny, well lit places are simply phenomenal!!

ZOOM: 18x optical zoom with 10 megapixel? Heck Yea. And up to 32x optical zoom (125x with digital zoom) on lower megapixel settings (7, 5, 3).

IMAGE STABILIZATION: Panasonic has the best OIS in my opinion. At 18x the manual says a tripod is required, I find otherwise. With OIS mode 1 the picture is stabilized with the shutter button halfway pressed. You can still take a great picture if you can limit your shaking hands.

OVERALL: There is still so much to write about this camera. I am very satisfied with it. It has all functions in a relatively small body. Every picture is great because it could also be tweaked with RAW editing software. Finally, it is easily adaptive to any user. My whole family can use it. I read the manual and set a few custom modes that my parents will most likely use. One for my brother and one for my self. In the end there is still a great auto mode and raw editing.  

I have some sample pics uploaded.

<Content>Amazon doesnt disallow the writing of comments/reviews based on whether someone owns a product or not.  Ive used and owned other similar Lumix models, so can speak confidently of the great quality of Lumix cameras in the FZ series.  

However, for those inclined to upgrade to this camera without reading the specs carefully - naturally assuming it will have everything some previous models had and more - be aware that this model lacks a hot shoe (external flash mount) and manual focus ring.  For some people (like me) these are indispensable features.</Content>

<Content>I finally decided to give up my old Minolta 7000i film SLR camera from 1989, but just didnt want to take the D-SLR plunge beyond budget cameras, mostly the cost of camera body, set of several lens and flash unit together is too much. I played around with wifes PS, but still wanted something with more control. This gives it.

First, my issues - Zoom lense gives a great range but is touchy, sometimes overly fast beyond what slight nudges I want to give to frame a picture/scene. 
I dont always trust displayed view for exposure on LCD, especially if auto LCD adjust is on, so I turn auto LCD brightness off and use histogram for better exposure decisions.

Burst mode will racket resolution size down quite a bit. Scenery modes mostly work, sometimes (rarely) needs a little tweaking, but not allowed much leeway.
RAW and RAW+JPEG Saves really take time (almost 2 secs each shot) while JPEG only Saves is much, much faster (less than a sec.)
Manual can be difficult to find things in later, better to go through the manual with camera in your hand and try things as you read.
ISO above 800 can get grainy but acceptable.

Features Im drawn to - Quick menu joystick is handy when not in auto or scene modes; ability to do RAW if needed; histogram, scene and exposure-sharpness controls, autobracketing

its not a DSLR, but close on most control abilities. 
Video is OK but not the strong point here, camcorder has better controls and capacity. 

Update 10/31/08 - I just came back from month-long trip and took over 3000 pics and several dozen videos and want to add further comments.

Battery life - With the camera continually on with 5 min power save, battery life is about 300 pics - roughly 4 to 6 hours as a tourist taking intermittent pictures, so a second battery is needed for a full day shooting. Provided charger is quick, can charge during lunch/dinner if needed.

Videos - Clear Focusing not as good as camcorder, also night video has vertical streak runs based on lighting (in 1 of 4 night videos taken). 8 min video timeout is enough for most of what I shoot.

Photo quality is quite good, extended zoom still needs a steady hand or tripod. 

Wish the autofocus was quicker, continous AF helps but battery life is then reduced slighty - approx. 200 pics or more.
Also wish the IA mode saved in RAW.

I still want a DSLR, but this is still a very fine camera and will make a great backup when I get that DSLR later.</Content>

<Content>My husband and I own one digital SLR (Nikon D40) and two compacts. However, I feel the DSLR is a bit complex for me (requires patience) and the compacts do not offer enough functionality to the extent that I like. I was looking for something in between and I found it! I bought the DMC-FZ28 a week or so after it came out and was slightly hesitant as there werent enough reviews out there. But there were tons of great reviews for the FZ18 and I took a chance hoping that Panasonic was improving on a good product. Let me confess, I am not disappointed. I bought the camera right before leaving on vacation and I cant remember the last time I had so much fun taking pictures. The quality of photos is great. There is some noise at full zoom and you definitely need a steady hand taking pictures at full zoom, but I also think I still need to navigate through the P and M functions. The IA function is great and takes near perfect photos. I also need to fully understand the burst and continuous shot capabilities, and must admit that it might take a couple of reads in the manual to completely understand how they work. But overall I couldnt be happier and I highly recommend it. My husband was impressed by the zoom - his D40 with a zoom lens couldnt capture some of the shots that my camera did. </Content>

<Content>The leica lens is excellent. Even at 6400 iso and poor light I get great pictures with little noise. I really dont understand where from comes the noise that the experts talk about in small sensor dslr like camera at above 400 iso. At almost full darkness photos become poor but acceptable showing details that the naked eye cant see at this light conditions. Using 3 mega pixels and x32 zoom it is possible to get great photos that can be further cropped. Focus is fast and accurate at poor light and even at short distances without activating tha macro function which seems auto activated in most modes. The video is OK and zooming is possible. I highly recommend the camere despite the relatively small sensor.

cons: the manual is unclear for new comers, it shold be more focused and include glossary for all terms. The evf is OK and quite big but its location is inconvenient, the diopter adjusting is too though.</Content>

The bag fits this camera perfectly and also has room for the charger, an extra memory card, and an extra battery. Perfect fit with those 3 items. However, if you want to add anything else this bag will not work for you. I just wanted the basics, and it is very good for that!

<Content>Instead of reiterating the positives from other reviews, Ill focus on perceived negatives to help potential buyers.

1) The manual focus button on the top right of the camera is very close to the power button. If you have large fingertips you may turn MF on accidentally and fail to notice unless you study the screen a lot.

2) The record/playback switch is now on the upper part of the rear grip, which makes it prone to being accidentally moved by your thumb. But it is a convenient location. The component out jack nearby is also prone to having its cover flipped open, which could snap off if you dont notice.

3) My first Lumix was the bulky but well designed FZ20. It came with a hood with which you could completely shroud the lens using a UV filter to keep dust out of the mechanism. The FZ28 comes with only a petal hood. Apparently its tricky to engineer a full hood that doesnt vignette at the new 27mm super wide angle. It would be a custom job and might add too much width. This is my main disappointment with the camera.

4) The EVF is smaller and chintzier than the one on my FZ20. The view has curved edges, apparently because you see it at high magnification. I think they did this to keep the camera small but I use the EVF all the time outdoors. Its usable but the resolution is mediocre. Despite some claims, Ive seen no LCD backs you can really use in direct sunlight. You cant gauge exposure or frame accurately if youre squinting at a bleached image. Also, holding a camera with arms extended adds unsteadiness, which can be critical as you approach 18X. Panasonics OIS does work well at 18X with a good hold braced against the eye.

5) The dull, compressed sound in HD videos doesnt match the image quality. You can finally zoom (slowly) while recording but autofocus may lag. If theres some way to synch-record with an external microphone it would be ideal. Its fairly amazing to see 1280x720 video come from a camera that does so many other things. But HD video playback (QuickTime) often cleaves during fast panning; sections appear to be shearing off each other. Ive been using a Patriot class 6 SD card which is supposed to keep up with the data rate. Buying this largely for the HD video would be a mistake; get a dedicated camcorder.

Other comments: I find less high-ISO noise vs. my FZ20, even with the sensors 36MP/cm² pixel density. As with many digicams there is some muddiness to broad color swaths like far away leaves, but you have the option of RAW shooting or turning NR down. Chromatic aberration seems well controlled at max zoom, possibly assisted by a UV filter.

Dont hesitate to buy this camera if you can live with the above. It is compact, light and fast on the draw.</Content>

<Content>UltraZooms have came to bridge the gap between Point--Shoot cameras and DSLRs. They may not be the easiest to carry in a pocket (especially in the summer) but offer much better lenses, sensors and features than their cell-phone sized cousins. This is what has came to be known as the CREATIVITY segment of the camera market - and the PANASONIC FZ28 is the its absolute leader.

For months now I kept borrowing my brothers FZ18 as I was researching the market for my own UltraZoom. Since this could not go on indefinitely (and my summer vacation was coming up), I decided on the NIKON P80. Although a very good camera I found it fickle and unpredictable if left on full Auto. My belief that NIKON would never put out an inferior product was confirmed but I am not a professional photographer: I missed the simplified perfection of my brothers FZ18.
Luckily the Internet merchant I had bought my NIKON from offers an upgrade insurance option: for a small percentage of the total cost I bought the option of returning the camera within 12 months (provided in perfect working condition) and having it replaced with a latest model (from the same merchant of course). So, when FZ28 became available, I did just that.

As with the FZ18, the Intelligent Auto (iA) setting is a dream! Perfect crystal clear pictures under (almost) any conditions, EVERY TIME. There are more tweaking options than one could desire of course, but elusive scenes often do not allow for minute setting fidgeting: a reliable Auto is a good friend in a tight moment.
The older model was reported to sometimes have a problem when there were intense sunlight and shaded areas in the same shot: nothing of this sort with the FZ28. I have posted some sample photos (at the black FZ28  page)to illustrate exactly this.

The new features of FZ28 include a new sensor (10.1MP/2.33) coupled with the also new Venus IV engine; an enlarged high quality LCD (2.7 from 2.5); a wider lens system (starting from 27 instead of 28mm - but also ending at 486 instead of 504mm); a new auto-tracking focus feature; an auto backlight compensation function (missing from FZ18) and (finally!) zooming while taking video.
The cherry on this cake: FZ28 comes also with a leveling function which helps align buildings or the horizon with the subject - even after taking the picture! (OK, essentially it is cropping but still...)

My only gripe: as with FZ18, FZ28s zooming control is counterintuitive! One zooms IN the picture by pushing in it, whereas zooms OUT by pulling back. Well, as with the FZ18, the direction of the zooming control is in the opposite directions. (If someone knows how to contact Panasonic-Japan by email please let me know, I would like to offer them my opinion).

<Content>I am so glad I ordered this camera online from e-bay.I got a brandnew camera with Panasonic warranty,8 gigs of memory,cleaning kit,and extra battery,a tripod,etc.I had tried 3 models of the sony point and shooters.They were the H2,H7,and the H9.These cameras had some very good features but none of them could produce pictures like this Panasonic DMC-FZ28.With all three of the Sonys, results were varied.Sometimes I could get a great shot and sometimes not, even using the same settings under the same lighting conditions.I am so happy with this camera since I received it via UPS a few days ago,I havent been able to stop taking pictures.I havent had one that didnt turn out good.Ive only used the IA setting so far but I could use this setting for days and days and never be disappointed.The zoom of 18x is fantastic and the pictures are great when I handhold the camera.I dont notice any blurring, out of focus results.The 10 mp feature is fantastic for blowups.I have blown one of my 10 mp pictures up to 16x20 and it looks so sharp and clear.This camera uses the Leica lens instead of the Carl Zeiss lens that Sony uses.I think the Leica is definately better in my book.I was thinking about buying one of the dslr cameras after the Sony models because of bad results with my shots.I am so glad I gave the Panasonic a try first.It had only been out a couple of weeks when I was able to order it.After having the fz-28, I dont think Ill ever have a need for a dslr.The only slightly negative thing about the dmc-z28 is the fact that the lens adapter doesnt come with the camera and you have to purchase it extra.To me though,this doesnt bother me that much because I know its really worth it.When that adapter arrives Ill be able to use a polarizer,nd,uv,and other neat filters on the camera.The filter size will be 46mm compared to Sonys proprietory 74mm filter size.Trust me on this.This is the camera you should buy.If you dont love it,I would be very surprised.Panasonic DMC-FZ28K 10MP Digital Camera with 18x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)</Content>

<Content>I suppose its best to be very objective when reviewing any camera, but its really hard when it comes to the Panasonic DMC-FZ28. Getting into the technical aspects is best left to the experts. For people like me, the fun factor is more important, and this camera is FUN! To find a camera that does so much so very well is rare, but this one does - in spades. Features that set this baby apart from others are many and varied, from the incredible optical zoom ratios that can be attained, to the incredibly easy auto features. There are so many things that are right about this camera, that finding foibles or flaws is a real chore. I gave up looking for faults long ago. The camera also comes with some really useful software, such as PhotoFun Studio and Silkypix Developer Studio, for processing RAW shots.

The camera is new, and professional reviews are scarce right now, but when they do come, Im sure this camera will come out very well indeed. This is a camera for people who want it all in a fairly small, one-piece package. Panasonic has scored a home run with this one.

In conclusion, this kind of review might not be as specific as some would like. But getting into the specifics of this camera would take a whole lot of words. Suffice it to say that if you buy this camera, you will never be sorry you did. It is that good!  </Content>

<Content>I bought a Panasonic fz18 last year and finally returned it and waited its upgrade. 
I bought fz28 from Amazon a week ago. I must say Panasonic fz28 is a great upgrade. 
1 I can change the zoom when using video function, fz18 cannot. I suggest turn off the continuous AF function if you want to have a clear HD video (fz18 doesnt have HD mode).
2 Set ISO Mix to 800, I got beautiful pictures with acceptable noise (better than fz18).
3 The battery life is superb. I shot 380 pictures and 40+ seconds video, the battery indicator didnt turn to red yet (better than fz18).
4 iA function is more intelligent than fz18, I hardly miss the scene that I want to shoot.
5 LCD is larger and clearer than fz18.
Finally I have to emphasize the lens again. Leica lens with 18x optical zoom, equals 27mm-486mm (10 mp), and 27m-866mm (3mp). WOW. You can shoot anything far away from you and get nice pictures (better to use tripod 12x and up).
This fz28 suits all my leisure travel or family event needs. Its little bit bulky but very light, better than carrying small PS+ bulky DSLR + heavy camcorder bundle.
I recommend fz28 to everyone.</Content>

<Content>Let me state for the record that I am a Canon lover and I bought this camera just because I was looking for a high zoom camera and Canon just refuses to go higher! Sorry Canon, I still love you, but now I love my FZ28 better!

Here are my (more than) 2 cents:

Pros:
----------
 27 mm Wide angle - No more asking people to squeeze in so they can all fit in the frame! I have a Canon S5 IS too and I took shots of the same place with both cameras and the difference was striking! FZ28 wins hands down!

 18x Zoom - Yes its only 486mm, not that much of a difference as compared to S5 ISs 432mm, but if I choose the 3MP mode instead of 10MP mode, I get 32.1x zoom, i.e. 866 mm. Thats just awesome. Yes, some of you will freak at only 3MP resolution, but hey, my first camera was a Canon A80 at 4MP and I have awesome 8x10 prints from that camera, so for sizes like 4x6, a 3MP resolution is sufficient unless you want to crop the image.

 HD movie recording with zoom - Note that the resolution is 720p and not 1080p. (FYI, I recorded a 4min 36 sec video today and it came to 735 MB. So its a memory hog, but with that resolution, you cant complain)

 Light weight - Yes its bulky, but at least its light

 The iA mode worked wonderfully! I took several low lighting shots without the flash and the results were amongst the best I have seen. Admittedly there was some noise (there always is at high ISO), but it was very bearable given the low lighting.

 Face recognition

 Orientation Sensor - I dont know why dpreview.com says no for this. The camera DOES have an orientation sensor.

 Minimum shutter of 60 sec - I can now take some night scenes at low ISO = low noise!

 RAW mode

 Smooth opening covers for all the ports. On the S5 IS, I had to pry them open.


Cons:
----------
 No external flash - Not really a con for me because I dont use an external flash, but I know that many of you do, hence this comment.

 No 2 second self timer in iA (auto) mode. The 2 second timer is available for other modes.

 No flip out and twist LCD (Argh! I really like this feature on the Canon models)

 Custom battery. I much prefer using standard AA batteries that I can buy easily and cheaply in case of a battery emergency

 I took away 0.5 points for construction because I felt that the cameras exterior looked cheap when compared with that of the S5 IS. The buttons are very plastic looking and the shooting mode dial also doesnt look as sophisticated as that of the S5 IS although it functions just as well.

 I also took away 0.5 points for ease of use because I felt the menus were more cumbersome to use than Canon menus. Of course, this is a matter of personal preference but I feel Canon has done better in this regard by simple things such as putting some commonly used features as buttons, for instance, the ISO selection button.

 2 GB limit on video recording - Argh! I still need to buy a camcorder!

 MOV format for movies - Again, personal preference. I personally prefer avi.

----------
Thats all folks. I will update this review if I find more things worth sharing. 

Bottom Line:
----------
An EXCELLENT purchase!</Content>

<Content>I have been using a Panasonic TZ1 for a little over two years. Thats a nice 10x zoom pocket camera. But its ISO is a bit low for indoor use. The shutter lag of TZ1 also cannot keep up with my growing two-year-old twins. They move too fast for the camera to chase.

My main use for the new camera is to record my kids life. From time to time, I extend my artistic interest to scenes, buildings, animals, insects, flowers...

Ive had this camera for a week and took over 1000 photos. Its simply fantastic.

Things I like:
1. The shutter response is much much better than my old camera. In most cases, it will focus quickly and accurately. I use iA mode occasionally. Most time, I set it at program mode with Fn(Function)button programmed to select different focus mode. Contrary to one of the reviewers, I feel its very responsive. And Face Recognition really works on this Camera.
2. The lens is great. You can capture incredible photos far and near.
3. Wonderful IQ! I constantly mess around with different shooting modes and do comparison shot. I have to say that the iA(intelligent auto) mode in many cases is doing a better job in focusing, exposure, white balance, etc than I do(Hard to admit a machine is smart than I am. :-D). Im still trying and learning. But I feel eventually I might give up and let the iA totally controls me. 
4. The menu system is well-written. Im only half-way through the manual(Probably Ill never finish the other half). But theres not a function I hesitate to use or feel frustrated when maneuvering through the menu system. 
5. The lay-out of the buttons is well thought-out. I especially like the dedicated record/playback button. Why no one else thought about it. So convenient! Love it.
6. LCD. This is perhaps the brightest LCD I ever had. Everything is nicely detailed. 

Things I think the next gen Panasonic FZ should improve:
1. ISO. I have very usable photos which are shot at ISO 400. But there are several times I hope the ISO will be even higher for low-light conditions. 
2. Ghost-band(Purple/blue vertical lines) on LCD in strong direct light condition. This happens to many digital camera system. But I feel it shows a bit more on this camera.

I frequent dpreview. A few people there(Plenty never set their fingers on the camera) complain about the small EVF of this camera. I primarily use LCD for taking pictures.  So I dont really care about EVF. But to be fair and objective, I tried EVF with about 100 photos. Its clear, bright and nice. 

Conclusion: Its a fantastic super-zoom camera which can take incredible photos. A nice step-up from simple PS. What are you waiting for? (Panasonic didnt pay me to say the last line)

Update 09/30/2008: Ive been using this camera for about one month. Literally thousands photos taken. Again and again Im impressed by this camera. This is truly a versatile camera. It takes excellent photos under a broad range conditions. Its hard to go wrong with this camera. 

Update 12/27/2008: Its been four months since I got the camera. The more I use it, the more I appreciate its functionality, features and build quality. Best buy ever.

Update 04/14/2009: I found out that my computer/camera illiterate wife uses this camera much more than I do. (Of course, she spends more time with the twins too. )She was intimated by all the buttons at the time when I bought it. Now she just leaves the setting at AI and doesnt bother to mess with anything else. Photos almost always turn out to be perfect. Nothing says more of the camera than this. Great job Panasonic!!!</Content>

<Content>This camera is everything you want in a point and shoot. Closest to a bridge camera Ive seen.  One drawback is the shutter lag is waaaay to long.  The quality of image is a 10.  Buy an extra battery (PANASONIC ONLY NOT A LOOK-ALIKE).  If you are going to shoot RAW get a 8G SDHC card. Shooting JPEG only using a 4G card gives you 700+ pics.  Shooting RAW+JPEG gives you 200!!  If you dont know why the FZ28 is a little pricey IT IS THE LEICA OPTICS.  The SILKY PICS RAW software is very easy to use.  Adobe 6 doesnt recognize the Panasonic format,so you have to develop in SILKY and save as TIF or Jpeg and then reopen the TIF in adobe for any final manipulation.  Having a lens hood is a great accessory. ELF has a dioptor contro for adjusting to your own eyesight.  
This is the camera to buy!  If you cant afford it wait and get the soon to be released (SEPT) Kodak Z1015. It doesnt shoot RAW but, it is a GREAT camera.  Check out my website for pics I took with the FZ28 and the Kodak Z812.  [...]</Content>

<Content>UltraZooms have came to bridge the gap between Point--Shoot cameras and DSLRs. They may not be the easiest to carry in a pocket (especially in the summer) but offer much better lenses, sensors and features than their cell-phone sized cousins. This is what has came to be known as the CREATIVITY segment of the camera market - and the PANASONIC FZ28 is the its absolute leader. 

For months now I kept borrowing my brothers FZ18 as I was researching the market for my own UltraZoom. Since this could not go on indefinitely (and my summer vacation was coming up), I decided on the NIKON P80. Although a very good camera I found it fickle and unpredictable if left on full Auto. My belief that NIKON would never put out an inferior product was confirmed but I am not a professional photographer: I missed the simplified perfection of my brothers FZ18.
Luckily the Internet merchant I had bought my NIKON from offers an upgrade insurance option: for a small percentage of the total cost I bought the option of returning the camera within 12 months (provided in perfect working condition) and having it replaced with a latest model (from the same merchant of course). So, when FZ28 became available, I did just that.

As with the FZ18, the Intelligent Auto (iA) setting is a dream! Perfect crystal clear pictures under (almost) any conditions, EVERY TIME. There are more tweaking options than one could desire of course, but elusive scenes often do not allow for minute setting fidgeting: a reliable Auto is a good friend in a tight moment.  
The older model was reported to sometimes have a problem when there were intense sunlight and shaded areas in the same shot: nothing of this sort with the FZ28. I have posted some sample photos to illustrate exactly this.   

The new features of FZ28 include a new sensor (10.1MP/2.33) coupled with the also new Venus IV engine; an enlarged high quality LCD (2.7 from 2.5); a wider lens system (starting from 27 instead of 28mm - but also ending at 486 instead of 504mm); a new auto-tracking focus feature; an auto backlight compensation function (missing from FZ18) and (finally!) zooming while taking video. 
The cherry on this cake: FZ28 comes also with a leveling function which helps align buildings or the horizon with the subject - even after taking the picture! (OK, essentially it is cropping but still...)

My only gripe: as with FZ18, FZ28s zooming control is counterintuitive! One zooms IN the picture by pushing in it, whereas zooms OUT by pulling back. Well, as with the FZ18, the direction of the zooming control is in the opposite directions. (If someone knows how to contact Panasonic-Japan by email please let me know, I would like to offer them my opinion).

<Content>Having used the fz18 model for while, i had a chance to look at this model a few days ago. While i did not use it for more than a few hours i managed top get a nice handle on it. The camera is designed to be do everything ok but master nothing. To master everything is probably not realistic since you do not have the luxury of DSLR lenses for everything length. I think i will mention my likes and dislike.

Likes: 
1. video mode is very good, video is clean and has decent sound.
2. good image quality, even at 12x+(must use tripod for anything after 12x)
3. Nice lcd screen
4. good battery like. i shot about 400 shots before they were depleted.

Dislikes:
1. still too heavy to use for macro, must have a tripod
2. as light dissapears so does the qualify of the evening shots.
3. flash is a bit weak

overall, i think if you have used these type of models (with 12x+ lenses) you will not find anything earth shattering. but you will enjoy the new upgrade.</Content>

The problem....no time to learn how to work the camera, so I learned how to turn on the camera, find the subject, press the button, and a beautiful picture appeared! Very happy with every one of them.

Now when I learn all the OTHER things that this cute camera can do, I will certainly raise my rating to 5+ stars.

I would tell everyone to get this camera, I have the blue one. Easy to handle and small. I know that I will love this camera and will be glad that I bought it.  Try it, you will love it!</Content>

<Content>I bought this as a Mothers Day gift for my wife based on several online reviews of the product.  Within an hour of taking it out of the box it died.  The LCD screen ceased to function properly.  The image disappeared, a set of vertical lines marched across the screen from left to right and then the screen turned red and died.  I called Canon tech support and they offered to fix it but, since it was brand new, I opted for the exchange, which Amazon handled very promptly and courteously.  However, they didnt have another in stock so I took the refund.  I then ordered (also from Amazon) a Canon SD1200IS.  This has functioned flawlessly.  1 star for the SD1100IS only because I couldnt give it zero.  5 stars for the SD1200IS.  </Content>

<Content>My sister was the one that did a lot of research on point and shoot cameras.  After much research they decided to purchase this camera.  I waited until they received it to purchase mine.  I am very pleased with this camera.  
My husband and I also have a Canon S3, but I wanted something more portable and less bulky for family gatherings and less intense picture taking.  The SD1100 offers everything the S3 does, but in a much smaller package. 
The face finder feature is great, plus you can crop pictures directly from the camera.  You can also change the setting to shoot in black and white or antique brown.  Not necessary, but definitely fun to play with!

I havent honestly found any cons with this camera.  Maybe because Im used to using a Canon.  The one thing I didnt want on a point and shoot was the time delay from taking the picture to the time it displayed.  This camera is pretty fast with that.  Almost instant.  So no complaints there!  Definitely get what you pay for.  I do believe they have come out with another newer model, but Ive heard that model isnt as good.  I wouldnt hesitate to spend $200 on this camera if I had to!!!    </Content>

<Content>This is the third PowerShot I have owned.  They get better and better. Easy point and shoot with great results.  I will compare my photo quality with almost any other. We do a lot of traveling in the U.S. and Europe and the convenience of its size and weight is fantastic.  I laugh when I see others carrying larger cameras when my small camera does the job so well.  The versatility is beyond my skill level, although I keep trying new features.  If you are going to own only one camera, this might be the one.  My only wish so far is that there was a battery charge status indicator.  I will reserve a 5 star rating until I see that feature.</Content>

<Content>This camera was purchased as a gift for my wife a while ago. I use Canon gear to shoot weddings, and will only recommend Canon gear to friends when looking for a point and shoot, or SLR camera. Nothing against Nikon, have used a Coolpix 950 way in the past, and never used their SLR line.

This camera follows suite with any other Canon product weve owned. The image quality is stunning. Pictures are correctly exposed for the given conditions. The face tracker actually works quite well. The shutter delay is acceptable for a smaller point and shoot. Many point and shoots suffer from a prolonged period of time from when you press the shutter to when the picture is taken. 

There are a number of custom functions which allow for creative play in the menu system. Youre not going to get full manual exposures on this model camera, but creativity modes are easily understood even for the novice. The menu system follows like all other Canon menus and are intuitive, displaying what keys to press for a given action. In other words, you dont need the manual in front of you to change operating modes. One of my favorite is color selecting. You can point the camera at a given color in the focal range. Select that color, when you take the picture, that will be the only color exposed, the rest of the image will be in black and white. 

The body of the camera tends to scratch rather easily. Id suggest keeping it in a camera case Crumpler Thirsty Al is great Crumpler THIRSTY AL Camera Pouch! 

The videos taken by the camera are acceptable. Not that youd expect anything phenomenal from gear like this, but they work in a pinch. They are imported right into iPhoto which makes editing on the Mac quite easy. 

One of the points that I made to my wife in getting her this camera over the Axxx series that Canon produces is the rechargeable battery. The battery seems to last forever, and recharges quickly. The battery is compact which adds to the compact size of the camera. 

Finally, Canon gear holds its value quite well. I am hear writing this review 6 months after she got the camera, and it has been superseded with a newer model, and the price is HIGHER than what I paid for it then. Ive been quite successful in reselling well kept Canon gear for only about 30% less than what I paid for it. This makes the progression to the next model much easier to swallow price wise!  </Content>

<Content>This is my sixth (yep, 6th) Canon SD series camera.  The Image Stabilizer makes a big difference over prior versions when shooting at long range or with considerable motion.  This feature alone was a big selling point for me having been the recipient of the notorious ultra-compact shake and blur.  

Because this is not a DSLR you cant expect the glass to be comparable nor the level of manual control to compare.  That said, you are probably buying this camera because you want a camera that can be easily packed for daily life.  It starts up quickly and takes decent shots on your vacation, at your kids dance recitals, soccer games.

It is lighter than many previous SDs and feels less substantial.  Id say that the build quality is down from the SD500-series but unless you have one to compare, you are not likely to notice.  

Bottom Line ... for less than $200 you can get this camera and a 16GB SDHC card that will address 98% of your needs.  I paid $184 for both in May 2009.  Enjoy!</Content>

just dont drop it in the sand at the beach.......not even once, like i did. This is the replacement for an older model which was excellent until the sand got in the lens.....then it couldnt move to focus....bummer.

<Content>I bought this to replace an old Canon Powershot that stopped working.  Camera arrived promptly and is easy to start using right away, especially if youve used a Canon in the past.  Image quality is very good, particularly indoors or shooting subjects against a bright background.  I think image quality of all of these point and shoots has improved a lot over the last couple of years.  Small and light enough to drop in a shirt or pants pocket.  Pretty good value for the money.  I have no significant complaints so far.</Content>

The quality built is strong and slim, fits perfectly into my pockets. My only complaint about this product is the camera/video/view media switch on the back. It could have been better designed. Other than that, awesome product for its price range! I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN WITHOUT HESITATION.</Content>

<Content>We bought this to replace an old 4MP Nikon.  The main reason we bought it is that it uses the same battery and charger as our older SD630.  We paid $150, and Im shocked to see what the price is up to now.  I guess with it being replaced by the SD1200, thats the new cheap guy on the block (but it uses a different battery.)

These cameras are great.  The IS seems to work ok.  They are small, and tough.  This is the kind of camera you can take with you everywhere, just by keeping it in a pocket or purse.  Plus you cant go wrong with the Canon name.

<Content>I bought SD600 years ago. Wonderful little gem fits in shirt pocket. This year I bought SD1100 for my mom. Lots of major step up. Focus, shuttle speed, turn on time. The digital zoom beyond 3x optical zoom gives better focus than that of Kodak P880 I have at normal range. Battery life is great on mine.

One thing Canon could do better is to spend a few more cents on the things like mode switch, battery cover. They look cheap and squeak a little. This would make this little gem a perfect DSC.   

Good job, Canon!</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for the sole purpose of capturing decent pictures of my active children. I did a lot of research and settled on this one. I am SO glad I did! I have been nothing but thrilled with it. I was most impressed when I tried to take a picture of my 4 year old. Being his typical self, he RAN at me to try to avoid getting his picture taken. I clicked anyway. He came out CLEAR mid stride! I was sold at that moment. I have gotten many GREAT shots of my kids. I was iffy on purchasing because just about all of the pictures displayed are of macro shots (amazing!!!) or scenery (Also amazing). I really wanted to see more of what it could do with people. Let me tell you, it does a fantastic job! You will not be disappointed!</Content>

<Content>I recently purchased a Canon PowerShot 1100 through Amazon.  With regard to Amazon, I was extremely pleased with the speed of delivery and the quality of packaging - no problems there!  And the camera is amazing!  For something so tiny, its packed with features.  I think the feature that surprised me the most was the movie capabilities - I guess Id missed that on the specs.  Its also easy to use, which is especially important to me since Im still having trouble setting up my address book in my cell phone.  The pictures so far are superior in color and clarity to my Olympus 35 MM point-and-shoot: not bad, considering Ive been very happy with the Olympus.  All in all, a great experience!</Content>

And, NO CAMERA!
I have checked my credit card account and it doesnt appear that they has charged me, at this time.  Obviously Im concerned not knowing how long they may have my cc info to possibly try to charge at a later date.
Definitely, DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!
Note:  I would not have given the company any starts, if I had been allowed to.

<Content>Perfect little camera.  Doesnt have all the bells and whistles of a lot of the competitors but this just does what I want and need and does it very very well.  I have had a couple small Canons in the past and was never really impressed with the battery life.  I can say that so far so great with this one!  The battery is awesome and the quality of the photos is superb.  I usually read dpreview.com when looking for a new camera and this saved me a lot of aggravation once again.  I was on the fence between this camera and the similar Casio (with some really cool looking features) and after reading the reviews I went with this one.  Thankfully I did!!  My dad bought the Casio and even though we are not professional photographers you can see the difference in the quality of the photos, which is the most important thing at the end of the day.</Content>

<Content>We travel extensively and I always take hundreds of pictures but before we went to Hawaii I decided its time for my wife to have her own camera.  After much research I decided the Canon SD1100IS was the ideal unit for her.  I got it for her in the blue color that matched her eyes and they really lit up when she got her hands on it.  During the 3 weeks we just spent on Maui she was never without it and she joyously snapped hundreds of photos on to her 4 GB chip.  Best of all, even though she has very little experience the photos are beautiful..... in some cases better than I got with my much more expensive camera and years of snapping away.

The camera does everything well and as she gains experience she will take advantage of its further capabilities.  This is the best point  shoot camera I have ever handled and one of her friends has already bought one just like it (but the pink one doesnt match her eyes).

<Content>I actually have now purchased this camera twice. First for my not so tech-savvy mother who before I offered to pick out, set up, and teach her to use a digital camera, was planning on going out and getting a 35mm in April of 2009. After receiving it for her and setting it up for her use, I ordered it for myself as well to replace the Kodak digital camera I had been using.

This camera is easy to use, takes nice pictures, battery has a good life, charges fast when it does need to charge, has very solid image stabilization (great if youre like me and have shaky hands), and very fair priced. Only thing still left to be desired: I still would like better night pictures. This camera is 100 times better than my old Kodak in dark conditions, but still not quite as nice in similar conditions as my girlfriends Olympus.

As a side note: My mother loves this camera due to its ease of use, which is basically all that matters to her. A very solid choice for a point  shoot.</Content>

No matter what the ambient lighting conditions, the subjects always come out bright on a very dark background. This occurs even with quite bright indoor lighting. Setting to Indoor mode on the function menu does not seem to help much. The best Ive usually been able to do is turn off the flash, and hope for no motion blurring. </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera because I wanted a pocket-sized camera for a trip to Hawaii; I also lugged a friends video camera along with me. Well - I was so impressed with the video quality on my little Canon still camera, that I never bothered with the real video cam. I suggest you buy the 16 GB card if you want to do video. And sure - you wont be able to film the next Star Wars on it - but I got a surprising amount of video on the card; At least 7 or 8 minutes - and I still had room.

Oh - and the still pics are great too. Also - with the 16GB card - there is room for over 4000 pictures on the high quality mode - and 9999 on the lower setting. Its very easy to use for both still and video, and it starts fast (in case you need to take a pic in a hurry!), and the time in between photos is very fast at the low setting, and pretty fast at the high.

If youre looking for great pictures in a camera smaller than your wallet - this is it...</Content>

I researched sub-compact digital cameras for several weeks before choosing this one, and am glad I did. The zoom lens is far better than expected at this price.  The images are comparable to a much more expensive camera but this one is easier to use.

Positives: Takes great pictures, zoom is great, easy to use, different colors helps them identify theirs, battery fully charges in about 1 hour (remove battery from camera  plug into wall charger), fits into pants pocket or purse, upload into computer/facebook/email.  negatives: memory card only holds about 15 pics, so bought a 128mb memory card which holds about 50 pictures. The price of camera + 128mb memory card = less than $200.  A great value.</Content>

 Picture quality is very good. The menus are fairly clear, and settings can be customized to your taste. It does take some navigating through the menu tree to make changes, but that is the universal drawback with ultracompacts (not many dedicated buttons).Overall, an excellent buy.</Content>

<Content>I just bought this camera to replace my Samsung Digimax A7 which only last about 2 1/2 years, so I am hoping to get more from my Cannon. Shipping was super fast, it is very small which I like. I only gave it 4 stars because I did find it a bit hard to use. I am also still searching for a reset button if there is such a thing, I would like to get the camera back to how it came new. I guess I will have to play around a little more with it. Overall great pictures and video. I took it outside today and it did a really nice job on taking outdoor photos. SO far I am happy with this purchase. </Content>

<Content>I will put it this way - the best of the best. I used to have few cameras and all of them left us totally unsatisfied, but this one is something. We heavily are using this camera for the last 10 months - our son was born and we made more than 4000 pictures by now. Considering the fact that we were making pictures and videos of a small baby and of a baby-on-a-move the percentage of good pictures and videos is nearly 95%. Very impressive. I would recommend EVERYONE. Very good purchase - all-in-one!</Content>

<Content>Weve had another digital for years but I really wanted a new one and a compact camera. This one is fantastic, takes great pictures, and the transfer of the images to my computer is easy.  The only thing Id say, for potential buyers, is be prepared to buy a larger memory card. The one that comes with the camera holds very few images.  I made sure to look for a camera that had an optical viewfinder (not just the LCD viewfinder as that can be hard to use in bright light).  This was the only quality camera of this size that had the optical viewfinder and Ive already found it useful.</Content>

<Content>I go through a lot of cameras so I have tried many different models in many different price ranges. This is on the lower price end of the ones I have owned but I am still impressed with the pictures it takes. It is not going to give the the same quality as a SLR or even G series camera but for point and shoot you cant go wrong with this camera. It is super light and small enough to fit in your pocket so you can take it everywhere you go. I noticed that I took more pictures when I owned this camera just because of the fact that I had it on my at all times. Larger cameras you need to where on your belt or around your neck and it is just to inconvenient to take them everywhere except for special occasions. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is thinking of buying it. Also Canon is my favorite brand of digital camera for overall quality of photos and size and look of the cameras themselves. You will be happy! </Content>

<Content>I had an older Canon PowerShot that I loved, and it broke after like 4 years (I must have dropped it and the inner screen shattered), so I purchased this Canon PowerShot SD1100IS in blue (cheapest color). 

Pros: 
Very easy to use, uses an SD card that I can pop in and out of my computer or switch out. 
Rechargeable battery (comes with charger)
Large view screen
Good picture quality
When you switch from take picture to view picture, the lens doesnt close (this could be a pro or con, as I see why they do it, but it kinda annoys me)
Very small - fits in a purse or pocket fairly easily (this is my favorite part)

Cons:
3x zoom isnt much, so its hard to take wider or closer shots
Something is wrong with the flash I think - Ive had problems taking pictures in various light settings, and I cant figure out how to adjust the light settings. 
On that note, there are a lot fewer user settings than the older version of the camera, so you cant do quite as much (e.g., no redeye setting).
Battery does wear out over time (dont overcharge!), and a new battery costs almost half of the cost of a new camera.
Obviously, it can break, as my last one did.

So get a case with it!

<Content>My daughter gave this to me as a gift, and I couldnt be happier! I am not one for lots of bells and whistles and manuals. I want to be able to pick up a camera and use it and thats exactly what I can do with this camera. Nothing complicated! I have another digital camera that is larger in size and has more features that I still dont know how to use. This camera is easy to use, the pictures are clear and I love the size of the camera even though its taking some getting used to after using a much larger camera. The quality of the pictures I have taken with my larger digital are close to that of the PowerShot, but on close-ups, theres no comparison. Awesome! I am totally satisfied with this camera and would highly recommend it to anyone.</Content>

<Content>This may be a good camera, depending on what you want in a camera. I returned mine mainly because it does not have an internal memory. I find this to be a necessary requirement for a camera. The camera is also very small, great for my teenage kids, but too small for me to work comfortably. I do not like how the zoom control is on top; I like it on the back - much easier for me to use.  Working through the menu seems very complicated, not easy like my Kodak Easyshare.  </Content>

<Content>We bought one of these cameras several months ago and couldnt be happier with it.  Ive owned several other Powershots over the years, and replaced them as the the megapixels became larger and the features more numerous.  Its always been a completely dependable camera.  The great thing about it is that you can put it in your pocket or the smallest purse and carry it along wherever you go.  If a camera is too bulky to be taken along, it just doesnt get used as often.  How many times have you decided against bringing a camera along because you just didnt want to carry it?

This camera has a lot of great features that are very intuitive to use, more so than most cameras.  They include digital zoom, flash, no flash and autoflash selections, macro, infinity focusing among others.  Ive taken some very sharp photos with the macro.  The flash lasts for about 300 times on a charge and the charge without the flash seems to last for a very long time. It has a long-exposure mode that lets you set exposure times as long as 15 seconds manually.

The pictures are sharp and clear and the colors very natural.  With Canons Face Recognition Tracking, its a snap to take focused pictures, emphasizing the persons face as the sharpest focus.  Even if the person moves while you are preparing to take the picture, Canons Motion Detection Technology follows the persons face and keeps it in focus.  This is a great feature when taking pictures of children or taking pictures at parties.  The LCD screen is large, bright and easy to see. There are lots of other features, many that Ill probably never use.

If you want a reliable, easy to use, point and shoot camera at a good price, you cant go wrong with this one.

This tiny camera has more than met my expectations.  Its easy to use, shoots great videos (allowing you to zoom during the recording process) and adjusts effortlessly to macro focusing. The battery seems to last well and, with an upgrade to a 4gb memory card, there is plenty of room for pictures and videos without the need to download often.</Content>

<Content>I have always purchased Canons, and as usual, I am very happy with this product. Ive had it for about a month now, and its been great. The picture quality is pretty clear for a compact camera. I had previously purchased the Canon Powershot SX110IS which had a better picture quality, but was much too bulky for my taste. I would recommend this as an everyday camera, but those looking for top pic quality may want to spring for a larger camera with better zoom. </Content>

So, I left it for a while  and a few weeks later,I tried again and it turned on. Then a few  weeks later the same thing. On and on. I now have to send the camera to Canon to  be fixed. I have read other reviews online where people have the same problem.  If youre looking for a camera that is reliable, I would  not get this one.</Content>

I selected one of my photographs for a 20X30 wall print when I came home and it turned out incredible!  I am continually amazed at how powerful this little camera is!  I selected the brown one and it is a gorgeous color - very unusual.

<Content>First thing i noticed was the size(about the size of a credit card and around only a 1/2 inch thick) and the build of the camera,(more metal than plastic)definitely a good looking camera, and it comes in many different colors. The camera has many different features, and shooting modes which i would recommend you completely read the manual to get the best use of the many features. The camera takes very good quality pictures, and with the many scene options it makes it easier to take even better photos than in the regular auto mode. The LCD screen is very bright and easier to see in the sunlight than some other cameras. The battery life is excellent! If you go on vacation(overseas) all you really would have to do is to buy a extra battery(around $10 or less) and you could take well over 600 pictures before you would have to start to worry about your batteries dying. other small cameras that take AA batteries can get expensive and annoying. Finally, and most important to me is this canon sd1100is has a VIEW FINDER, most cameras(except some canon and sony) do not have view finders, as this feature is getting harder and harder to find. One last note: the optical zoom is ONLY 3X, so if your looking to shoot at hard to reach objects(such as animals) then this is not the camera for you...</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera while rushing to get ready for a trip to Peru... it was fantastic value as I was able to get it at Costco for 149.99 w/ a memory card and a case! However, I feel I should try and warn people about some quirks I noticed about this camera...

Pros:
First off, this camera takes impressive photos. Once you get the hang of its modes, you can take some truly amazing shots. I got a lot of compliments on my shots of Peru which had some amazing shots (yknow, that Machuu Picchu place)..other pros include:
1. seriously compact size (so light you forget its there), more than small enough to fit in your jeans pocket
2. great lookin - I had a brown one which people raved at
3. amazing battery life - I never had to recharge once. I just did to satisfy my own paranoia. That includes a 4 day trek through the Andes by the way.
4. Powerful flash
5. Very cool editing options - you can change things to black and white or sepia...AFTER taking the photos. You can get rid of red-eye. Its sweet. And this is all in the camera before you transfer... ah, technology.
6. You can digital zoom during video. (be realistic, you have to pay at least a hundred more for a camera that can optically zoom for a video)

Cons:
I had an SD600 from back in the day which unfortunately got KIAed after being accidentally dropped in water. However, the same limitations I noticed on that camera are still present in Canon point-and-shoots...
1) Takes forever between shots. Sometimes you just get frustrated and push the button all the way thru despite the fact that the focus never wakes up. You are then rewarded with an awful pic. It seriously takes a full 3-4 seconds between pics for this thing to get ready and that feels like an eternity when youre trying to get shots of something that is fleeting.... i.e. a temple w/o people in the way, etc.
2) Night time modes still suck. It is seriously tricky to get this to work - usually things are blurry or way too over-exposed. And yes, anything over ISO 800 is totally useless.
3) Zoom is very limited. Sometimes you can honestly laugh at how weak the optical zoom is. But I have to say theyve improved the digital zoom quite a bit from the 4 MP days.
4) Dust noise is markedly worse - yknow those annoying spots you get from dust? I guess this is a side effect of having a more powerful camera but it can get seriously ridiculous

And the elephant in the room is....the LENS ERROR. This is a defect unique to Canon and was truly a shock to me. Im used to Canons bouncing back from rainy days and being accidentally dropped. After using this camera ONCE at an outdoor wedding reception (with some dustiness inevitably ocurring) my 2 month old 1100 IS gave me a lens error 5 times within 30 minutes. Each time I had to remove the battery and start over. 
This is a serious flaw and frankly fatal for me, I ended up returning what I had considered up to that point, to be a pretty sweet camera. So for all buyers out there, be aware that if you find yourself in a humid situation (rainy) or a dusty situation (outdoor receptions, etc) your lens mechanism stands a risk of failing. If you google this, many many people have run afoul of this issue and have had to pay over a hundred dollars to get their less than 1 year old cameras repaired by Canon. No thanks!</Content>

<Content>As a previous Canon SD Series camera owner, Ive to say that they really made a wonderul job with this model, my previous camera was a Canon SD600 and compare to this one all the improvements are remarkable.

First, battery life is much better, around 300 pics with flash and the recharge response is way faster, every time you need a new picture you will get a flash, not like before.

Also they add the battery meter (I dont know how they miss this in the previous models)

The picture quality,as always with Canon is superb, nice colors, virtually no blur and a fast an intuitive menu of functions, multiples types of shots and picture quality and size.

If your looking for an slim, fast and affordable pocket camera, this is the one you need.</Content>

It was put in a box that way too big with absolutely no padding.  When I picked it up from the post office, it was sliding all over the place inside the shipping box. Two of the corners on the product box were crunched.  Fortunately the camera wasnt damaged. I love the camera though, I use it almost daily and it takes great pictures. Its small enough to carry everywhere, its very quick to turn on and has a quick recycle time for taking a lot of pictures very quickly. 99% of the time I am taking pictures of kids, and so far the camera has not let me down. This is a 5 star camera, but 1 star service, so it gets a middle of the road rating. Definitely try to get it from a different seller if you can.</Content>

<Content>I read about the canon SD1100 having a Lens error  problem. Well I bought the camera anyway because I liked everything about it. Took great pictures. But then out of nowhere I went to take a picture and when I turned it on all that happened was a beep and the screen said lens error, restart camera. Ive tried restarting about 100 times and it still doesnt work. This camera is not even a year old! I will NEVER buy another Canon powershot. If you read reviews about this camera this is a common problem. Wish i would have listened!</Content>

I would recommend this camera to almost anyone who wants a small, camera that takes quality pics.</Content>

<Content>I had this camera for less than a month, and loving it. 
Pros: Very compact,can fit in your shirt pocket
      Battery life is good. It only takes 1 and 1/2 hour to charge
      Takes crisp pictures (I use 3.1mp to 8mp settings)
      With 8GB sdhc card, I can take videos with sound at high def (680i)
        quality!!
Cons: It takes 2-3seconds to actually take a shot after you press the 
        shoot button so you miss some spontaneous moments.
Overall impression: Very happy with my purchase.

<Content>After reading reviews and shopping, I purchased the Canon SD1100IS. The camera is everything all the 5 star reviews said. The only thing that is a change for me is getting used to the zoom control.  It is different than all the rocker switch controls that I am used to and is mounted on the top of the camera. I would redesign this control. Otherwise, this is a great little camera that I would recommend for anyone to take with them wherever they go.</Content>

this camera is so amazing left me with a smile.... i found out a better way to use this camera to use available light inside the house... yes indoor lighting................ i switched the mode to DIGITAL MACRO !!! 

for some reason it set up the camera just right without even using flash 
and took amazing pictures =) i even used zoom in /zoom out 
-iso was in auto 
-no flash 
-antishake is on 
-fine 
-M1 
-autofocus and that icon that looked like a flower w/ the letter D 
-u can zoom to 4x 

i even took pics of television and the image of tv was captured beautiful 
idk if this will apply to all point and shoot camera with macro setting 
but this particular model i have - powershot elph sd1100is - does the job great......... 

if i discover some other successful experiment i wont hesitate to share...

I love all of the features this camara has...I can edit my pics right from the camara. I have a nice Sony, but I wanted something that takes quality pics that I could carry in my purse.

Needless to say, it was a disaster the pics would be fuzzy and nothing you wanted to share.  WELL after reading a blog I decided that it was time to not only upgrade my camera, but get back into my pause***click days!  

I just got my camera and Ive already taken tons of photos and Im enjoying it.  Its fun sized, so I pop it in my bag or pocket and Im out the door.  I love it!

I love the screen auto-rotation feature so you can see portrait style pics in full screen. I also like that it comes with a rechargeable battery because AA batteries dont have a large capacity and dont last as long. If you are afraid of your battery power running out on you, simply purchase a replacement battery and have it charged for back up. This camera is a MUST HAVE for the ordinary photo lover.</Content>

<Content>I absolutely adore this camera. Ive gone through a couple of digital cameras in my day (Im clumsy) and this one is by far the best. Not just because of its apparent durability (it bangs around inside my purse and comes with me everywhere) and its size/weight (fits inside my purse!) but because of the gorgeous pictures it takes. With just a few shooting modes, you can take terrific pictures in any condition. I often feel like a photography genius when I use it. The battery lasts for a very long time. So long that I dont feel I need to carry a spare. The shutter lag is a little long but other than that, I have no complaints. This is the perfect camera for an amateur who just likes to document their lives and share pictures with their friends and family. </Content>

<Content>The Canon PowerShot SD1100IS is a great little point  shoot camera.  It is tiny - fitting easily into a shirt pocket - and takes great pictures, even in difficult lighting.  I have yet to read the manual.  I was surprised to find that the camera knew to enable flash in backlit situations, and even more surprised to find that it had face-recognition software built in (which really works).  A great buy!

My only complaints: the camera shipped with a small memory card, so I had to purchase a larger card separately.  Youll also need a simple case/sleeve to protect the LCD screen (also missing from package.)</Content>

<Content>If you are looking for a compact, easy to use, point and shoot reliable digital camera with a reputable name - then this is the camera for you.  With Canons Face Recognition Tracking, taking focused pictures has never been so easy.  I am really impressed how when reviewing the pictures in the camera it shows two images of the same shot.  One of the entire image and the other one shows an up close look of the face.  Even if the person moves while you are preparing to take the picture, Canons Motion Detection Technology follows the persons face and keeps it in focus.  The automatic red eye removal is a terrific highlight as well. Also another wonderful feature is the video mode.  You are able to use the 3X zoom feature while recording videos, my other digital camera will not zoom while recording.  I paid a few hundred dollars more for my other digital camera and this camera by far beats it quality, features, advance technology and reliability. Any other camera that would offer what the Canon Powershot SD100IS has you would expect to pay hundreds more.  

I purchased this as a camera/printer combo at a great price over the holidays.  I cant give a review on the printer since I have not tried it out yet.  I normally do not print out photos since I usually just upload the pictures to a CD or insert them in my digital photo frame.  Wow how the times have changed.  The bundle was offered for $20 more than the camera alone so how could I resist.  I have no doubts that the printer works great since it is by Canon.  

Make sure to get an SDHC card to be able to store plenty of photos and mutliple video images.  I purchased the Transcend 8 GB SDHC SD Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6E [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging.  This card will hold approximately 2000 photos depending on size format.  I have priced memory cards and Amazon prices cant be beat.

Buy this camera, you will not be disappointed.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera mainly because it was a Consumer Reports Recommended Buy.  I have not been disappointed.  The camera was easy to use right out of the box, but has way more features than I had imagined.  It will take me some time to learn and use them.  I immedaitely took it on a trip to Jamaica and got beautiful pictures.  The controls are very intuitive, especially for those who use cell phones, ipods, etc. and I was able to use many of the features without referring to the manual.  The camera is small and easily fits into a pants or shirt pocket, but, be careful to use the wrist strap as it can easily slip out of your hands.  The view screen is large and bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions.  I highly recommend this camera as it has all the features (and more) of cameras costing much more.</Content>

<Content>I was just looking for a small camera to supplement my Nikon D50.  Something I could throw in my pocket when going out to dinner with friends.  This camera definitely fits the bill.  Also, the price point is reasonable.  To go up to the next set of features (long zoom, better LCD) you need to add 50% to the price--a bit more than I want to spend for a second camera.

Most of the pros and cons are covered elsewhere, so I will mention some you dont hear about. First, the camera has a stop-action movie mode, that shoots a frame every second or every other second.  This is really fun for parties.  Set the camera in a corner, and end up with a movie that shows the entire event in a few minutes.  I set it up in the corner and made a quick 30-second video of us cooking dinner last night.

Second, when using the time-delay shutter--which I often do for group shots--you can set the camera to take multiple shots when the timer goes off.  No more running back to the camera to take another shot.

This is a great, take-it-anywhere, fun camera.</Content>

The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because I would like to be able to plug the camera directly into an electrical outlet to charge the battery.  You have to remove the battery and slip it into the battery charger, then plug the battery charger into the wall.  It does have a usb cable to connect to a computer for downloading pictures and I dont know if that will charge the battery as well.  Havent yet learned about all the little nuances of this camera.</Content>

She claims she didnt harm the camera in any way, but it just wouldnt close one day.  Now when we try to turn the camera on, it makes a clicking noise for a while and then displays the error, lens error, restart camera.  The camera is completely useless now and will not operate.  Im going to call Canon for service, but many of the posts I have read state that this is not covered by warranty.</Content>

<Content>I am not a professional, but this is a wonderful camera for what I am looking for.  I love that it is compact and sleek. I am able to easily take it camera with me to capture my kids when we go trips.  I would buy it again and I would tell my friends how great it is for my needs.  You do need to keep the instruction book handy and play around with the camera, though.  I had it on a function that was all wrong.  Dont even know how I did it.  I found the correct function and everythings great again!</Content>

<Content>I cant say enough good things about this awesome camera! I was in the market for a simple yet sophisticated camera from an older Kodak that Ive had for years. I was looking around and the price and specs on this camera seemed to fit the bill. It can slip easily into your pocket and in your hand for quick snapshots! I love the fact that the images come out so clear! I took a small road trip just the other day and took many pictures as I was driving (I was careful!) and all came out clear :)  . . Also, my parents have multiple dogs - two great danes and a boston terrier (who is VERY hyper) - and I can take pictures of them too and theyre not blurry! The fact that it also takes SD cards made the switch from my old camera to this a breeze since it took the same type. No need to buy new specialty camera cards! I also love the Color Accent Mode- Im pretty sure everyone that I show it too is jealous that they dont have that feature on their cameras. I also have tested the panoramic image feature and it was quick, easy, and truly a great feat! This camera packs a powerful little punch. I understand you can get it in different colors - but I chose the silver one and at this point I cant say anything bad about it! If your looking for a simple, inexpensive yet great digital camera - this is the one to consider!</Content>

Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera 
This is my second Canon camera, its so easy to use.  The best thing is I can snap a photo while my husband is driving with the built in image stabilization.  I can also catch my Corgi in many cute poses without a blurr.  Its lightweight and takes a very clear picture.  No batteries to deal with is another plus.

<Content>Ive had a couple Canon cameras, and this one replaced an SD300 which I loved. The SD1100 is terrific! The menus are easy to use, it takes great photos, and it is small enough to tuck into a pocket or purse. I also have a long zoom digital, but this is the one that is most likely to go with me everywhere. 
Battery life is great. We took a 5-week trip to Asia, and visited several places where electricity was not available. I had brought 2 backup batteries, and rarely needed even one. I easily fit 1000 photos on a 4GB SD card too. There are decent manual controls, which allowed me to take photos of a native dance indoors at night as well as great outdoors photos, including sunrises and sunsets. I love my long zoom camera, but the portability and long battery life of this one make it the one I most often rely on.</Content>

This camrea is very nice.  Although it has a smaller sensor by 2MP, the images are still awesome.  Mind you not as good as my Canon 50D, but for quick grab and shoot, it offers a very nice compromise of size and quality!</Content>

<Content>I ordered the Canon PowerShot SD1100IS after doing a great deal of research on Amazon and other camera sites.  What I was looking for was basically a point and shoot, but one that would take nice, even somewhat artistic photos.  I havent been disappointed.  The battery life is great, the flash is super powerful (some people have even said a little blinding), and the ISO settings let me set it up so I can take pictures in low light.  The display is pretty accurate, the buttons are easy to use, and I can easily hook it up to my Macbook and download the pictures directly from the camera in an instant.  I had also been considering the Canon SD790 IS, but 10 megapixels really seemed like more than I needed.  It doesnt end up giving you better quality photos per se.  The photos just end up taking up more space on your card and on your computer.  
I would recommend the Canon PowerShotSD1100 IS to anyone looking for an excellent point and shoot.  Also, be sure to buy an extra battery just in case and an extra memory card (I bought a 4 GB one and am very happy with it).  You should also invest in a nice case to protect it; its pretty small and I always worry about it getting knocked around in my messenger bag.  </Content>

<Content>The PowerShot SD1100IS is the second Canon ELPH that I have owned.  The first was a 4MP model from about five years ago.  I liked that camera so much, I decided to stick with Canon.  I spoke to a Canon representative at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January and he told me to go with the 8MP model rather than spending the extra money for 10MP (as long as you dont plan to enlarge to more than 11X14).  I am completely pleased with this camera.  The photos look great (3-4MB each).  I also purchased a 4GB SanDisk card, which I would strongly recommend (the camera comes with a 32MB card which will only hold about 10 photos in fine quality).  With the larger memory card, you can get up to 30-minutes of good quality video.  Also, the battery life is much improved compared to older models.  I recommend keeping the instruction manual handy until you learn all the functions (which are many).</Content>

It takes great pictures and videos.  I reccommend it for anyone that wants to take great pictures at the drop of a hat.  Right now I havent encountered any negatives with this camera. </Content>

<Content>My wife has loved her trusty old Canon A410 for a long time. It was literally falling apart, and she still didnt want me to replace it. When I finally insisted, she gave me two criteria:

1) It had to be a Canon (because shes familiar with the controls, and the software on the PC side)

2) It had to have a viewfinder (not just the LCD on the back)

My wife is nearly legally blind (and still takes incredible photographs), and she insists that the viewfinder is the only way she can reliably line up a shot.

In order to make for bigger LCD screens, most cameras have dropped the viewfinder altogether. That made picking the Canon PowerShot SD1100IS very easy for me (after very little research).

She loves the camera beyond description, and I rarely have to muck with the images before posting them to my blog (on the A410 I used to have to lighten or darken them frequently), as this camera takes terrific photos on nearly every shot.

Highly recommended!</Content>

<Content>I got this camera a few days ago and it is my 2nd compact camera. It replaces my Nikon Coolpix 4300 that I had since 2003. This camera is very compact.The battery only takes 90 minutes to recharge. This camera takes excellent quality images. This camera is small enough to take to concerts which is one of the main reasons I chose this one. It has an automatic lens cover when you power the camera on or off which is a plus. (no more lens caps).Only has a few buttons on the back, but they are the ones you will use the most. It does not have many manual function settings- it is basically an automatic point and shoot. The only things you will need to complete this camera is a 4 or 8 GB SD card and a carry case.This camera is selling for $100 less from when it first went on the market a year ago.This is one of the few point and shoot cameras that still averages at least one rave review per day on amazon and one of the most reviewed cameras.(around 650 reviews as of 2-21-09). This camera is definately 5 stars!</Content>

Ive used the party (indoors) shooting mode with great success.  I captured the party streamers shooting across the room at a birthday party.  In the Kids and Pets shooting mode Ive captured great pictures of the cat and dog playing.  Once you learn to use the different modes you can get very creative.  Although I have yet to try the vivid color mode, you can create special effects in the camera without using photo editing software.  It even offers manual settings for those who want to tweak their photos.</Content>

<Content>Weve used Canon point and shoots for several years and without a doubt they consistently take the best photos.  Bought this as an entry-level replacement camera for my husband (who unfortunately dropped his last one), and who is not very technically minded.  And he absolutely loves it and is taking much better photos now. This is a great point-and-shoot camera for a beginner, or someone who doesnt want to mess with settings - or as a back-up if you have a much bigger better camera and just want something that will fit in your pocket, but still give you a great quality photo.

This model includes face recognition, which seems to be the latest trend now - but it works just great.  Said husband always used to manage to take out of focus pictures whenever there were two people in the shot - because the camera would focus between them - face recognition successfully resolves that problem.

Image stabilization helps to avoid the blurs.  Also offers great quality movies that you can zoom in and out of while shooting.

However - it is quite tricky to access the great choice of pre-defined settings: the usual suspects such as indoor, outdoor, sports, etc. and some great extras like fireworks, aquarium, underwater, kids, color swap (theres more).  They are a couple of menus deep, and not very intuitive to find. We never use these settings, and still manage to get good shots 99/100. But - theyre there for the beginner who wants to be a little more adventurous.  Also, the zoom button is a little difficult to manoever.  It comes with a printed manual (rare these days) that really does give excellent instruction on how to use all the different modes.

In summary - if you want an entry level point-and-shoot that is pretty much guaranteed to give you beautiful quality pictures, this is your camera.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera so I had a powerful, yet small camera to carry with me wherever I went. I didnt expect all the features in this power-packed little camera.

Its fun to use. Its a beautiful camera. It fits in your purse or pocket. I bought a nice leather case for mine. I suggest you buy an extra battery. Buy.com has them as I write this at a very low cost. I also suggest you get an 8GB SD card. At least a 4GB.

The zoom is excellent and easy to use. The surprise is the macro. It picks up the dust on my keyboard. And I can use the macro without a tripod. The stabilizer is fantastic.

There are lots of reviews on YouTube, all over the Web and here on Amazon. So I wont do an in-depth review. Let me just say that you wont be disappointed with this camera.

Also, should you need support, Canon has about the best support there is. At least they did the last time I used them with another Canon I had. Ive not called them with this camera.

I bought mine from BuyDig for $149. Shipping was free and they sent it by FedEx the same day. I got it in three days. Also got my leather case there. I recommend BuyDig.

Highly recommended.

The brown color is pretty and distinctive. It interfaced smoothly with my Mac and the pictures just loaded right into iPhoto. I did buy a larger memory card to go with it.  </Content>

<Content>This is my 3rd digital camera and definitely best yet- great pics  easy to use.(my old cams: canon A75 3.2MP, sony w70 7.2MP) After my two young boys broke the zoom on the sony (argg!) it was time to get a new camera. Some others I considered were the powershot A590IS  SD770IS, and Sony W150.

I chose the SD1100 IS for the SD card compatibility, the small ultra-compact size which I think is great for everyday point  shoot, Canons reputation in digital cameras, optical stabilization, the 230K pixel pure color 2 LCD, and the relatively inexpensive price, 139$ new. Retailers are charging different prices for different colors, which I think is ridiculous.

The 2.5 LCD is plenty big enough on an ultra-compact, in my opinion. Theres a trend in digital cameras to replace the optical viewfinder for a larger (2.7 or 3.0) LCD. Now for the included 32MB SD card...really Canon? Give me a break! If you must include one make it at least 1GB, please. Otherwise save the half cent you spent and keep your 32MB baby. Personally, I picked up an 8GB SDHC Kingston.

I recommend picking up a 2nd battery for a backup. Unfortunately, the Lithium-Ion battery Canon chose for this camera isnt the best. I got a Lenmar, cheap. Battery charge time isnt too bad though @ 1.5hrs. Also, a small case if you dont have one.

I have a few minor cons beyond the battery- appearance wise I really wish the sides were color coded instead of black, optical zoom should be at least 5X, the black plastic mode slider should be some sort of metal button as this gets used often, and the non-locking battery cover is flimsy (handle with care).

The 8MP size is perfect for my needs. The megapixel war, with digital cameras featuring 10, 12, or 14MP is just overkill for most ppl. Unless of course you are a pro photographer that need the ability to massively blow up and crop photos. The biggest size Id print is probably 8x10 and more commonly 5x7, with uploads to PC/email @ 640x480.

Overall, though this is a great small camera for the cost. Id recommend it.</Content>

<Content>I use the Canon Powershot SD1100IS for birding - held up to my 20x scope/tripod or 10x binoculars, otherwise the 3x zoom is of rather minimal use. So far Ive found it to be adequate to the task though the ability to attach an adapter would be helpful.  I shoot at raw power to allow for image enlargement if necessary and the pictures are good.  The most important charateristic for my purposes are size (ease of carrying), image quality, video capability, and price.  This product fills the bill.

<Content>This is my third digital camera and out of all the ones I have owned, it is the most intuitive and easiest to figure out. I only thumbed through the manual and was taking pics in no time. Its great for basic point-and-shoot projects. 

The brown color is unique. It stands out among the silvers and blacks. I was worried that it would look cheap -- but if anything, it looks more expensive than it is. 

Very happy with the price, although I dont understand why the brown color is 20-some-odd dollars more than the pinks and blues. Great value for the low price.</Content>

<Content>I did not yet buy this product (although I probably will within the hour!) but Id like to help out some other customers who are shopping for a camera. It was not clear to me that the battery and charger are included and I had to look through a couple of customer reviews until I found one that informed me of this important fact. Thanks to John P. Robertson who writes, I have... two spare Lenmar batteries in addition to the Canon battery that came with the camera. That helped me with the info that a BATTERY is included. For the info about the charger, I thank Lynn H. Pierson who writes, It was not clear to me on Amazon that the camera came with a recharger (IT DID)... I hope this review is helpful to others.</Content>

<Content>I hate technology and I hate reading manuals, but I love pictures of my kids.  So when my Kodak digital camera finally died (what a piece of garbage that thing was), I did my due diligence before deciding on this camera.  It holds a charge for a really long time, it takes and stores tons of pictures after a cheap memory upgrade, its easy to download and the quality of the pictures themselves are outstanding.  I mean, my kids are so gorgeous its hard to get a bad shot - but seriously.  This camera is the perfect purse camera for anyone out there who wants to take good pictures with no fuss.  And yeah, youre kids are probably good-looking too and with this camera youll have oodles of evidence to prove it.</Content>

I have had an SD400 for the past several years, and my husband wanted to take that one to keep at work for documenting his manufacturing plant.  So...I gave him mine - and bought the SD1100 IS!  I love it so far!  I love the image stabilization feature.  My SD400 never gave me any problems and took great pictures - I expect the SD1100 IS will do the same.

At less than $150.00 it is truly a best buy.</Content>

<Content>I purchased it because of the good review by consumer reports. I was surprised by its low price and then realized you get what you paid for. The most inconvenient thing is the compact memory card. The one that comes with the camera is only 32mb and can take up to a dozen photos only. I own two other canon cameras and a few memory cards but now none of them are usable. The lagging time of shots also seems long. The overall quality and ease of use is not the best. It is an ok camera if you do not expect much. </Content>

I bought a Kingston 2GB SD memory card for it and it works very well.  I noticed that the memory card was made in Japan.  And thats a plus in regard to quality.  Also it was formatted already so that was easy.  I set it for Super fine sharpness and can get 550 pictures with it.  That is more than enough for general snapshot use. </Content>

<Content>Great camera.  Small size makes sure you take it with you to actually capture moments.  Have had numerous digital and SLR cameras in the past and found no matter how great the camera was, if it was too large or a hassle to carry I would often leave it home and miss moments and great shots.  This solves that and is really easy to use.  Great for hiking/take anywhere camera.  Small size may be a little hard for larger hands.  I have large hands and can maneuver it pretty well but have to focus more on what Im pressing.  Definetly worth the trade-off for the size.  Pictures are fantastic, definetly excels at Macro shots.  Amazing quality and ability to capture detail up close.  General and landscape/scenic photos it does OK.  Pictures of people it does great.  If you are on the fence buy this camera!  Its worth it and Amazon by far has the best price.</Content>

</Review>
<Review>
<DocID>B0011ZK6PC-222</DocID>
<Content>Its been years since I purchased an ultracompact digital camera for myself. I got a few cameras for friends and family as gifts but I decided that it was about time to get a new one and retire my old Sony Cybershot. After days of research I found that I liked the image quality of Canon, so it was just a matter of choosing the camera with the features I wanted. Ultimately the research led me to the PowerShot SD1100IS. An after-Thanksgiving sale at BestBuy got me the camera, an extra battery, a case, and a 2GB SD card for only $150. So after having used this camera for a couple months now, here is what I can say about it. 

First, the good:
   - Stylish, small and light. It really is an eye catcher, especially in the colors offered. Canon isnt known to make the slimmest or gimmicky cameras, but I still had people complimenting it. Its small enough to fit in my pocket without being uncomfortable or bulgy.
   - Image quality rivals some dSLR shots. The lighting conditions dont even have to be ideal and I have still managed some amazing shots. Im sure the optical image stabilization has a lot to do with it, but the colors captured just seem more like what my eyes really see. Im not anywhere near professional, and yet this camera manages to make it easy to take good photos. Ive found that I rarely if ever need to go to Photoshop to make color and contrast corrections anymore.
   - Along the same lines as above, the built-in red-eye correction functionality works amazingly well. This probably isnt a new feature on most cameras, but I havent had a new digital camera in years. I found that the red-eye correction worked far better than Photoshops eye color tool.
   - Facial recognition is scary accurate... when conditions are right. More on that later. I even tried pointing it at a magazine rack in the bookstore and it put boxes around the faces on the covers.
   - Fast shutter speeds and startup times. Its ready to go almost as soon as you turn it on. Ive managed to turn on the camera and snag a couple shots of a speedy chipmunk in my backyard before the critter can scurry away.
   - Has an optical viewfinder. Never again will I strain while staring at the screen in the outdoor sunlight.

Here are the negatives that come to mind:
   - Either there are no manual exposure controls, or theyre hidden in such a way that I cant easily find them.
   - Small-ish screen. Its the same size screen as my older Cybershot, and I can see that Canon has released ultra-compacts with bigger screens. Not too big of a deal for me given that the optical viewfinder takes up some of that valuable real-estate on such a small camera.
   - Its really more of a nitpick, but the facial recognition works well only if your subjects are mostly facing forward eyes visible and their heads arent tilted too much. People with sunglasses, or hair obscuring their eye wont be picked up from what Ive found. Doesnt work at all with a sideways head.

Ive taken so many more photos with this in the past 2 months and I almost never have to do any post-processing to make my shots look better now. Its small enough to go with me almost everywhere. Its great for when youre going out and hanging with friends, to major events, family gatherings, and parties. I put the most mileage on it during Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Eve, as well as a wedding recently and the photos turn out great. It also takes decent enough videos, at least for uploading to Facebook. If youre on the fence about this camera, I highly recommend you go for it.</Content>

<Content>I bought this primarily for vacation-style snaps but found out it has the possibility to take artistic photos as well.  The close up capabilities amazed me.  True, the 3X optical zoom is the bare minimum, but I had luck using the digital zoom without compromising photo quality.  The different settings like sunset or aquarium really make a difference and Ive only just begun playing with color swap and the manual ISOs.

My only gripe is that the battery seemed to run out about twice as quickly as promised in the manual (about 150-175 non flash pix or 75-120 flash pix) but the included charger only takes 90 minutes so that wasnt too big of a deal.  Also, this camera only comes with 32 MB of memory so youll need a bigger card.

I recommend taking 15 minutes to skim through the posted photos people took with this camera to get a real idea of its capabilities.</Content>

<Content>I bought this as a replacement for the Canon SD1000, which I recently lost. As far as the features and user interface is concerned, its practically the same camera. Im glad, since I loved the 1000 and did not want much to change. Two great improvements are the image stabilization and the battery meter!!!

Overall, this is a fabulous camera. Its easy to use, takes great pictures, is small, looks great - all the things youd want in a camera. I highly recommend it to everyone!

The color is not very baby blue (as it can sometimes appear on the computer screen). Its more of a metallic blue/grey. Very nice, even for guys!</Content>

<Content>I have a rather expensive Nikon camera, but needed a point and shoot for the rest of the family. The family is very pleased with the camera thus far although it is a little early to praise it too much. I can say with confidence that based upon the familys delight with the small camera size and excellent pictures that they have taken, I purchased another SD1100 IS (camera only) for myself so that I can carry the camera with me in my shirt pocket. 

We have not used the printer yet although I purchased the camera and printer since it was a package deal (and pink?????) at a very attractive price (on sale before Christmas). The family wanted the camera  printer set so that they could easily print selected pictures. Sorry that I cannot give you a personal review of the printer but reviews on the Internet are very positive for image quality although at the price of a large footprint.</Content>

<Content>I bought this bundle for my wife. The camera she had was under performing. I have around 6 digital cameras (Canon, Kodak, Panasonic). Honestly, the Canon digital cameras are the best cameras out there. Beside its ease, what sets the Canon SD1100IS apart from the others is its meter. While other camera produce dark, incorrectly metered photographs, this camera takes photos that are vivid, full of life.

What makes this bundle double awesome is the Selphy printer. One can make beautiful 4x6 prints without having to go to a photo lab.</Content>

The camera body is beautiful, but some of the external parts are plastic--such as the function slider--and seem too flimsy to stand up to frequent use. I read many reviews on the camera. It is top rated for its class and price, and it has proven to be what I expected (small, light, inexpensive, and easy to use). I am happy with my purchase.</Content>

<Content>I think this is a pretty good camera for its size.  Its takes clear pictures and decent videos.  I think it turns on fairly quick...which is great.  All the cannons that ive used have a red light that appears before you take a shot, as does this one, so sometimes it bothers me, but not a big deal.  I think the quality of the battery/sd cover could be a little better because it doesnt feel very stern.  However, as a causal picture taker its perfect for my purposes and i would recommend to others like me!</Content>

<Content>I had bought a Sony Cybershot and was totally disappointed with the indoor photo quality. I returned it and bought the Canon Powershot SD1100 at Walmart for $199. Ended up returning that because it was $154 here! For $31 less than I spent at Walmart, I got this camera, a spare battery and a nice carrying case from Amazon. The camera is almost instant-on and time between pics, a BIG criteria for me, is really fast compared to Sony and Kodak cameras Ive had. The pictures are great with just the standard settings - havent had time to look around and try out any adjustments. I have a 1GB card and that seems great for pictures, although youd need more like 4GB if you want to take any movies, too. Size is good, not too big or small and screen is plenty big. HOPING for no lens error messages!</Content>

<Content>This camera worked well after six months, but in the past week, after the camera opened, it stayed open and beeped, saying Lens error, restart camera.  Google this term and the Canon 1100IS and youll see many people with the same problem.  

A shame since Ive bought numerous Canon cameras over the years and have found them to work flawlessly.  Theres even a class-action suit over this to get them to acknowledge the problem with the 1100IS.  Google that and youll find info on that too.  

UPDATE:  Ive read accounts of owners who send Canon the camera in for servicing within the warranty period and for their troubles are told that its their fault instead of a production flaw.  I sent in mine prepared for the worst, but they ended up fixing it!  So in my case, they honored the warranty. Id give the product 3 stars now, but Amazon doesnt let you change the original rating.  </Content>

<Content>I was really surprised to see a few bad ratings for this camera. Im pretty picky about my equipment, and do a lot of research before buying. 

Im very happy with my SD1100IS. It has a quick button-to-shutter speed timing, excellent auto focus, super clear pictures and superb color quality. It also makes for a perfect camcorder, and the Image Stability is a life saver.

I have traveled to beaches and cities in the US, the Middle East and Europe with it, and for about a year now have never had a problem. For two hundred dollars I got this camera and a 4 gigabyte memory card shipped.

I suspect that people who have problems with their cameras either faced one of two situations. 1.The camera was defective out of the box, in which case anyone should immediately return it for a full refund. 2.They dropped it hard and either didnt notice or wont admit it. At any rate, when you buy something with a trusty credit card, you should consider yourself protected for at least 90 days for a full refund.

As far as pocket cameras go, I find Canon to be the best choice. I use a Nikon in my studio for product photography, and have tested many brands including plenty of Sony models, always returning to the Canons for price friendly and reliable point  shoots.

<Content>I am a high school student who is interested in photography (amateur status) and takes pictures for yearbook. I wanted a solid, attractive camera that could take fast shots, adjust to lighting quickly, and had a good auto setting, freeing me up to compose my pictures fast and effectively, rather than wasting time making sure the camera focused and that the flash worked correctly. This camera filled all those requirements, and it is the best purchase Ive made in a while. I research a lot before I buy an item, and I bought this trusting that it would meet my high standards. It did! And the blue aluminum casing is both pretty and durable. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small, light camera that takes fast and great resolution pictures. For an incredibly low price, too!</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera in brown in June. I used it every single day for six months while traveling abroad, then once I got back to the U.S., it got stolen. Without hesitation, I bought the exact same camera because the price, quality, and features are unbeatable. 

Brown in a great color. It is unique (I have gotten many compliments on it!) and it appears to have a matte finish that is scratch resistant (though Im sure the other colors do too). Brown is also a good choice because it frames the pictures on the digital screen well- the pictures truly pop out at you.

One of my favorite features of this camera is the ability to zoom in on pictures already taken. There are so many great things about this camera. After six months, my camera was still working like new; its just unfortunate that it got stolen. 

I recommend this camera to anybody who wants something easy to use, durable, and small! </Content>

Only drawback is you have to keep your fingers away from the controls on the back of the camera or youll unintentionally make changes.  Product came with a defective memory card which delayed us using it.  We called customer service. They advised us to buy a new one at Radio Shack. If it worked, return the old one for a replacement. We did, but it was a small extra expense.</Content>

This camera is not for a advanced photographer its options are all dumbed down to basic settings such as night shot snow  fireworks there is not a option for manual adjustment of the f stop but the camera does a awesome job if you are using the correct setting for the photo.

The only down side to this camera is that the focus light is rather bright, when we take a close-up of my daughter it causes her to squint in some photos.</Content>

<Content>I have now had this camera for six months.  I am SO glad I bought it.  Excellent pictures.  Easy to shoot.  I have never owned a slim camera like this, and find it constantly in my purse or pocket and getting taken out to use.  I even used it as a copier when my friends daughter needed a copy of a handout and we didnt have a scanner.  We took the picture, popped the chip into the computer, and printed out a good quality copy.

CONS: Its sometimes hard to get the adjustments right for the color in low light (they adjustments are there, but Im not an expert on it).  I wish the cover for the chip and battery was metal - it hasnt broken, but Im sure it will be the first thing to go.

<Content>I had a Panasonic 6MP 6X zoom with no viewfinder. No viewfinder was a pain outdoors. The LCD went through batteries. I think that the 6MP exceeded the resolution of the lens optics. The lens had some dirt in it which showed up in bright pictures when the iris stopped down some. I was not so sorrowful that the wrist strap was not really around my wrist when I reached out to shoot down the cliff. I recovered what was important: 2GB SD card, so I lost no photos except those I was unable to take later for the lack of a camera.

This Canon is only 3X optical zoom, though I think digital zoom (12X total) provides better quality than using Photoshop to do an equivalent digital zoom of a 3X optical shot. The Canon integrates the optical and digital zooms nicely. The Canon is engineered by a camera company. I trust Canon more for that than Panasonic, especially optics.

The Canon is really small. I carry it in my pocket all the time. It takes far more pictures on a single charge than the Panasonic ever did on a fresh set of alkyline AAs. The Canon has fewer special modes; e.g., baby mode, which is miss a bit. (Im a relatively new grandfather.) It has a few modes the Panaconic didnt have. These modes are a bit gimicky, but there are times they might be useful.

Offline, the Canon has a red-eye reduction function. Being on a camera, it is a bit awkward to use, but it does a very nice job. I prefer the job it does to Photoshop Elements.

The camera knows which way is up. This is nice until I purposefully take a picture upside down. I try turning the camera over to view it, but the camera flips it so it is still upside down. However, when I pull the pictures into my PC I can do anything I want with which way is up.

The ZoomEX Browser software for pulling pictures from the camera is easy to use. With the Panasonic, I always used WIndows Explorer. With this I prefer Canons software. One glitch: a process is left running that keeps me from releasing the SD card from my PC. I use Task Manager to murder the process tree, then I can Safely Remove Hardware. I am probably not exiting the ZoomEX Browser correctly or something. I havent check the web for solutions to this problem yet.

Picture quality is excellent. Exposure is good. Disabling the flash in automatic mode is easy. Price was very good. Turn on/off speed is good. Movie mode is excellent. Sure beats the old VHS camcorder I had years ago. Twice the linear resolution makes for crisp, clear pictures on a standard TV. I am disapointed that zoom is disabled while recording. It doesnt use standard batteries, but a single charge goes a long ways. I bought a second battery (pricey, but cheaper than buying batteries in the long run) so I wont get caught without backup. Macro mode works very well.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera for my wife for Christmas.  She wanted a small camera that was simple to operate and she could carry in her purse.  I wont belabor the details about the camera itself -- there are other reviews already posted that summarize all of its features.  My wife loves the camera because it is pink, small, compact, and simple for her to use.  I tend to be far more critical about my cameras and other electronic purchases.  Despite that, I find the Canon Powershot SD1100is takes very good photos with amazingly accurate color.  In fact, it was all I could do to keep from playing with it before I gave it to my wife for Christmas.  The camera is simple and fun to use.  

This camera focuses well even in low light conditions.  The automatic flash seems to assist with focusing in these situations.  The 3X optical zoom is adequate for most closeups.  Anyone needing a more powerful zoom should really be looking at SLR digital cameras.  The 8 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for viewing on a computer screen and should also make fine standard sized print photos.  Im not sure most people would use this camera to make 8x10 prints, but I believe it would still perform adequately for this.  Battery life is very good.  I charged the battery a few weeks before Christmas, and my wife has already taken numerous photos without needing to recharge the battery.  

I purchased a 4 GB SDHC memory card for about $10 (also available from Amazon) and an additional rechargeable battery for about $8 (including SH).  Canons (optional) pink custom camera case (which I purchased from Amazon for about $15) makes for a perfect digital camera outfit.  My wife loves the pink case -- it fits the camera perfectly, fits neatly in her purse, and seems rigid enough to protect the camera well.  There is really not room for additional items like the charger, USB cord, and spare memory, so if you need to carry additional things beside the camera you will be better off looking for a larger case.  The camera comes with a USB cord to download photos to your computer, but I find using a separate memory card reader (there are many available for purchase for very little money) makes this simple and easy with no drain on the camera battery.  

If you are looking for a stylish, basic digital camera that will take very good photos for not very much money the Canon Powershot SD1100is is well worth a look.  It is available in several different colors.  Frankly, I am strongly thinking about buying one for myself.</Content>

<Content>I havent had much time with this camera, but have researched many and this seems to be the best compact buy without sacrifising image quality. I have an A610 as well as a Rebel XT and love picture quality, ease of use, and affordability with Canon cameras. My A610 is great and takes wonderful pictures, minus the lens error I got with it, luckily Canon fixed for me, but I know others were not as lucky. 

I did have to have the first SD1100 that I was sent replaced b/c the lens sounded like it was catching and I did not want to chance it. I returned it with no problem and no charge. Amazon was out of stock, but I still received a new camera within TWO days of processing my return online. Amazon had overnighted it to me within one day of getting it in stock, no charge. The noise is less noticeble on this one. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING IT FROM AMAZON; CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EXCEPTIONAL.

For Now here is my opinion.

Pros:
MOST IMPORTANTLY: Takes vibrant/ crisp pictures
Easy to Use
Auto Red Eye
Image Stabilization
Face Detection
Compact and Lightweight
Battery- I like not having the weight of regular batteries
VERY AFFORDABLE (Compare to what you would get in other brands- compact)

Cons:
I compared it to my 610 and it seems like it does cast a warmer tone to  white and skin tones, but not extremely noticeble
Battery life could be better
Zoom and shutter a little noisy (might just be the sound it is supposed to make)
Flash Recycle time a bit slow 


QUESTION:  I would like to know is if the slightly static noise when zooming and pressing the shutter is universal. I will prob try one in store to make sure. For now I will give 4 stars.

Minor complaints:  Standard SD card was 32MB.  I ran out of space after less than a dozen pictures!  Get a 1G or so when you buy this.
Get a camera case.  The lens is protected when off, but I get the feeling its too vulnerable for trouble without one.</Content>

However, when zoom out all the way @ f2.8, all the four corners are dark, and quite apparent, unless the scence is very well lit, you need to zoom in abit like 1-2 f-stop @ ~f3.1-3.5 to actually not have that happens!

<Content>Hi! Ive had this camera for a month now. Overall Im happy, but there are some things I dont like.

PROS
- Lightweight, beautiful design.
- Intuitive menus, easy to use.
- Its right for someone who wants to just point and shoot, since most of it is handled automatically.
- Great price.
- Fits in your pocket, easy to carry.
- Good video quality, even in low light conditions. Better than I expected, at least. Its virtually blur-free, so thats good.
- I love the sound memo feature and the fact that you can record up to an hour of sound and the quality is good.
- I love the feature that allows the camera to adjust the picture to the orientation of the camera, so that you can see it vertically or horizontally, just by tilting it.
- The digital macro is very good, allowing me to take pics of very near subjects. Also, the quality is good enough to take pictures of documents, saving me valuable time not having to scan most of them.
- Battery life with the provided Canon battery is good, lasting for about a week. It also charges fast, in about 1:30 hours for a full charge.
- Being able to set white balance is very useful in indoor conditions.
- You can check the settings with which you took each picture in display mode, which is really useful for the amateur photographer, though I guess all of these cameras do that.


CONS
- Produces red eyes almost every time. I had an old Olympus that did not produce red eyes at all. I dont understand why Canon cant handle this better.
- Manual mode is very limited. You cannot select aperture or shutter speed, which is very disappointing. However, this feature is not available in any of Canons compact cameras. So if you want to be able to use the manual features, you need to go for a bigger (in size) camera, meaning, one that wont fit in your pocket.
- Image quality is ok, but not as good as I expected. I believe my old Olympus produced better shots. Granted, most of my shots have been in poor light conditions. Maybe Ill change my mind with some landscape pics with good light conditions.
- Color is not as I expected (yes, my old Olympus seemed better), but then you have MyColors to try and tweak that a bit. My question is, why tweak it? Why not have great color once and for all? I feel its a bit washed out or not saturated enough.
- Night shots without a flash will most likely be blurred unless you use a tripod, no matter how much they announce their image stability feature.
- This camera does not have a scene mode called Night scene which produced beautiful night pictures, with a slow synchro flash. This mode took some time to catch the background light and then at the end, it would shoot the flash, so that the people were lit in the foreground. In this camera theres no scene mode that does that (My old Olympus had it, of course and some Canon still have it). However, you can achieve similar results by using the Sloy synchro modality of flash. Now, you can only select that in the manual mode. Not in automatic, so its kind of a pain.
- The little flap door at the bottom that covers the memory card and the battery is really flimsy. You have to be careful not to break it.
- Some pics do have some noise, even at ISO200, which is strange, Id read that you would see some noise in ISO400 and up, but thats not true.


I suggest downloading the PowerShot Product Line Spring/Summer 2008 catalog, available in this link: [..]
It shows all the digital cameras and their features in more detail. This way you can compare.

<Content>I wanted a pocket camera that also took good video at 640x480. A friend of mine had the older SD1000 and I was particularly struck by the smoothness of the video. However, since that model was older, I tried the SD770 (since it was around the same price as the SD1100 and had more megapixels). What a disappointment! The video quality of the SD770 is far inferior to this camera, showing that more megapixels isnt always a good thing.

Along the way, I have compared video quality of similar cameras by Casio, Fuji, Samsung, and other Canons. The SD1100 -- for whatever reason -- has the least noise and most watchable video.

(A downside to the video is that the focus will not change during the length of the video, it is frozen at the moment you start recording. However this is true of all compact cameras.)

As for picture quality, it is pretty good, but I found the SD770 to have a slight edge. However, for me, the vastly improved video quality was reason enough to choose this camera. I hate using flash, I dont like the way the resulting lighting looks, so I use this camera almost exclusively without flash. Set in Auto mode, the auto white balance leaves a lot to be desired, especially in indoor shots. Depending on the lighting, your shots may come out looking too yellow.

However, I almost exclusively use this camera in Manual mode, and switching to Tungsten white balance usually helps for indoor pictures. As a plus, it also has a manual white balance mode, where you focus on something white and press a button, for lighting situations in which the presets are not perfect. This is a great feature too.

Although you dont have direct control over shutter speed, there is an exposure setting.  I frequently use this to lower the exposure for indoor shots, so that the shutter speed will be greater, so that blurriness will be less of an issue. The picture will not be as bright, but in many cases will be clearer.

Overall, I recommend this camera particularly if you are interested in shooting video. The picture quality is pretty good too but you may have to switch to Manual mode in some situations.

<Content>Bought this for my 15 year old daughter to replace a DSC40 Sony. Start up time on the SD1100 Canon is amazingly quick. You turn it on and can almost start taking pics immediately. Its compact size lends itself to easy storage in anything a teenage girl carries. LCD screen is very clear even in bright sunlight. The automatic display orientation as the camera is turned is a welcome addition. At 8 MP, plenty of opportunity to cleanly enlarge selected portions of any image, which we did for a science project. All in all, great camera!</Content>

<Content>Price and delivery were excellent.  Based on early experience, the camera produces the expected, sharp images.  Disappointingly, the camera display, in low light conditions, is very grainy -- noticeably more so than my older model Canon PowerShot.  I called Canon technical support who told me that this is typical with this camera. Nonetheless, photographs taken in low light conditions remain sharp and clear.</Content>

<Content>I recently purchased this camera for my wife who uses it for her work at the quilt guild. The image projected on the screen, on the back, is of very poor quality vs the last Cannon. You sometimes will see what looks like a faint green fuzzy line running from top to bottom on the screen. We also feel that the picture quality of the shots are not as sharp and clear as the last Cannon we purchased. Ill try another brand when this one quits working. It was a lot cheaper than the last Cannon we purchased in 2004, but most electronic digital cameras have dropped in price. Would choose a different camera if I had to make the choice again.    </Content>

<Content>As much as I hate to give a positive review to a canon product, this really is an excellent camera.  It is very easy to use and understand and is very small (easily fits in a pocket).  This camera also uses SD cards which are easy to collect and exchange as needed.  Additionally, the camera produces good IQ for a PS.  The camera is also fast to take a picture, it isnt like some other PS cameras that flash orange lights and pre flashes for 30 seconds before actually making the exposure.

As for the negative, the software that comes with the camera is quite mediocre and difficult to use.  If I didnt have a card reader Id be pretty upset about that.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera as a replacement for my Panasonic one after reading great reviews and being on top of most products reviews.  It is definitively as good as the reviews promised.

8.3 megapixels with optical image stabilization. It can detect up to 9 faces in a scene and use them to set exposure and focus. It also uses face detection to remove red-eye automatically and to calculate white balance for better skin tones (that said some night indoor images seem too orange/yellow, but it gets corrected if you select night mode). 

The Motion Detection Technology also uses face detection if the subject is moving and adjusts settings to prevent motion blur.

The lens (38-114mm f/2.8-4.9) is not as wide as the 870s  (28-105mm f/2.8-5.8), nor its viewfinder (2.5-inch LCD) as large (3-inch LCD), but is definitively sleeker, more technologically advanced (the 870 does not have the face detection features) and cheaper!</Content>

<Content>This camera is the perfect point and shoot.  The menus are extremely easy to use, the pictures come out very good and the camera will focus and shoot a picture faster than any camera I have ever used.  The drawbacks are the slow flash recharge time and the 3x optical zoom.  The screen is a good size, although the newer models have a slighly larger screen.  The memory slot will take a 16GB card.  I found this out after I bought it and was surprised to see at the highest resolution (8.0 megapixels) you get over 4500 pictures on a 16GB card.  Most people probably wont need more than a 4GB card for all their movies and pictures unless you arent able to get to a computer for a VERY long time.  For the price (got mine for $150 on amazon) it is a really good deal for a mid-range economy camera.</Content>

<Content>My wife wanted a small digital camera for Christmas that she could keep in her purse.  This camera fit the bill.  I am impressed that it takes such good quality pictures and the amount of custom features it has on it.  I initially had difficult capturing good candid shots of my young children because the red eye reducing lamp was turned on and it delayed the capture long enough for my children to make goofy faces or turn away. When I turned it off, there was no delay but there were red eyes in the photo.  I guess thats the price I have to pay to not have the red eyes.  So far I dont have anything bad to say about the camera.  It works well and I get great results (but my wife wants it back so she can take pictures).</Content>

It may not be the best digital camera for a professional or an advance user, but its a good digital camera for regular people who dont know much about photography.  Because of its size, you can bring it anywhere and put in your pocket.  Its convenient.  It also comes with video recorder with sound.  The features are easy to understand and use.  It comes with digital image stabilizer.  This camera is good to be used in dark places, because the picture will look brighter.  The only cons is if the pictures were taken in bright area, the pictures look a little bit dark.  Everything else is good and worth the money.</Content>

<Content>Ive been looking for an easy-to-use 10MP point and shoot camera because it was the newest in technology. Then I read some reviews that the 10MP cameras gave up a lot of the nice features (like 3X optical zoom) found in the 8MP cameras, whereas the extra 2MP just didnt matter for 99% of users. So I turned to the 8MP Canon Powershot, read MANY of the reviews and bought it for my trip to Hawaii. The camera performed beautifully. The photos are extremely sharp and colorful. Its VERY easy to use and VERY compact.
In some of the reviews people complained about the lense fault error and I got a little spooked about it. But now that Ive had the camera, Ive also had the same error 2 or 3 times because I was holding the camera with the lense against the palm of my hand when I turned it on. The camera immediately halted to prevent lense damage. All I did was turn it off and back on and it was just fine.
Theres plenty of manual options to set if you get into those special effects, but I just prefer to set it on auto and point and shoot. All my Hawaii photos turned out beautiful and Im not disappointed one bit on purchasing this camera. One warning, however: The photo card that comes with this camera only holds about 8 pictures! So get an 8 GB card for about $20 and youll run out of scenery before you run out of space!</Content>

<Content>Pros:
- Great Price for quality of the camera
- Easy to use
- Small size
- Good battery life

Cons:
- Need to remove battery to charge
- No internal memory

Purchased this for a recent trip to Walt Disney World. Took over 500 pictures over the course of the vacation, the majority of which came out great. It was small enough to fit in a front jeans pocket, easy to use, with a great battery time, although you may want to look into getting a spare if you take lots of pictures. Mine lasted almost two full days on a single charge, which was good, but also that almost caused me to miss a few good photo ops since it was dead. After that I charged it every day. Youll need to get a memory card; I purchased a 8GB SD and it was more then enough room for a few thousand photos.
I didnt think to bring the instruction booklet on my trip, but the camera was simple enough that I was able to figure out how to change all the functions I was interested in (flash, night type modes etc) within a minute or so. This is a great camera for someone who doesnt want to spend a lot of money, but still wants a good quality camera.</Content>

<Content>The Canon SD1100IS is small enough to take everywhere every time. It is capable enough that I sometimes choose to take it where I know Ill be taking pictures; situations where I normally would lug along my super-zoom.
Excellent battery life, very quick response, great flexibility.
Exceptional macro capability and well placed controls.
It puzzles me that marketing makes a big deal of its colors; this is a quality tool at a good price. Not just a toy.
I also have fun with the built-in stop-motion video modes.

The only minor difficulty is getting used to using such a small camera with my big fingers. There is a reason that the manual repeatedly warns one to wear the wrist strap.</Content>

We are so pleased with the improved features, in particular the quickness with which the camera focuses and takes a picture.  In addition, the camera finds and focuses on the faces in a picture, et this does not create any delays.  We have very many blurry pictures of our infant son because we had to take them without the flash.  Now, we can capture the moment we really want, the way we want it to look.</Content>

I love the features in this camera, especially the ability to swap colors and focus on one color while leaving the rest of the image b+w!  For a amateur who loves to take pictures, this camera is great.  The pictures here dont do the camera justice - the pink color is really pretty!  Im happy :)</Content>

I sat down and read the parts that I was interested in and about 15-20 minutes later I was set.  Use the camera features.  You would be surprised how many people dont use the night features and get terrible pictures at night and then complain that the pictures are awful--users fault not the camera.  The price is so reasonable.  Im going to try and upload some pictures here of my black and white pictures with only the red color that I took in New York--so cool! </Content>

<Content>I bought the Canon Powershot SD1100 IS to replace a larger Minolta Dimage camera that I sometimes did not carry on short trips because of its size and weight.  I used the Powershot for 2 months and was very happy with the results until one day just before Christmas I powered it up and the image sensor failed to transmit a picture.  The camera had NEVER been dropped or roughly handled.  I phoned Canon technical support and learned that spontaneous sensor failure is a common problem with this camera.  And while the camera is under warranty so repair  return shipping will be free, I still had to pack up the camera and personally pay to ship it to their Powershot repair facility in Illinois.  In my opinion, spontaneous failure of a critical camera system is unacceptable, and the fact that Canon knows about this problem and still requires customers to pay to ship their cameras for warranty repair is irresponsible.  I would not recommend buying the Powershot SD 1100, and I certainly wont be doing business with Canon again.</Content>

<Content>The SD1100 IS is my fourth Digital Elph camera.  The previous three have been wonderful cameras.  The SD1100 IS is not a good camera.  It has serious autofocus problems.  The autofocus in flash mode is not reliable.  Approximately 20% of the photos taken with flash are out-of-focus.  I have pictures taken on a tripod, with flash in which not a single object within the photoframe is in focus. 

I suggest you avoid this camera.</Content>

<Content>For $159 you really cant beat this camera. It is easy to use and perfect for the Mom or Dad who just wants good photos of their family. I really like the auto correct red eye feature. It doesnt get everyone everytime, but 8 of 10 isnt too bad. I had cannon with a lot more features and decided to step down to this one after I dropped it on the floor. I found I never used the features and the SD1100 seems to have pretty much all I will ever need. I think technology is advancing so quick I will probably want a new camera or drop this one in 2 years and it didnt seem worth the extra money for all the bells and whistles.</Content>

<Content>For me, just about any camera would be a suitable upgrade.  I am replacing a 2004 edition of a Kodak EasyShare LS743.  However, the Canon PowerShot SD1100IS exceeds expectations.  I tried others in its competitive set (e.g. Nikon, Kodak and Fuji) and although initially the Canon is not the easiest to figure out, the end results are rewarding.  The face recognition feature, when activated, really helps improve the clarity of the picture and the image stabilization is a helpful tool.  Consumer Reports and the New York Times rated it a best buy and I agree.  I am taking less pictures to the get picture results I want.  Enjoy.</Content>

<Content>Just got this camera on Christmas morning.  The wife is happy since it is a small and direct camera.  Amazon.com did an excellent job getting the camera and memory sticks to the house on Christmas Eve.  Kudos to the Campbellsville FC, which I am sure a friend of mine packed out for me, lol.  A few things to be aware of before buying this camera:

-- Read the reviews that list out the specs on this cameras, features, etc.  They are nice to review and give you an idea what is going on.
-- BUT, I have not found one that mentions the special NB-4L battery this camera uses instead of regular ones.  This is not a huge deal, but like any special battery comes issues with What If the Battery Dies?  You will be jammed up, since it is unique, and does not charge quickly like the Rayvoc 15 minutes ones.  
-- BUY at least a few more battery back ups!
-- Remember, this is a point and shoot, not a professional grade camera, so do not expect the world from it.  For the price and size, it does solid work, and will prove a great camera for years to come.
-- Consumer Reports named this camera their Top Pick for Compacts!  But they failed to mention the battery as well.  This was one of the rare rankings from CR that they did not recommend every item in a category, so this could mean a great product.

Good luck, and like any product, if it has an error, get with the companies as fast as possible for a replacement or refund.  I have always bought Fuji products for the larger cameras, but they do not make very good smaller cameras.  According to all the magazines, Canon is the standard right now, so we will see.</Content>

<Content>What can I say that hasnt already been said?  This is my fourth digital camera in the span of about four years, and my first subcompact camera.  I have used Sony, Kodak, and Polaroid cameras and the Canon is by far the best as far as image quality and durability.  I love that it fits right in my pocket and I dont have to haul around a camera bag.  It doesnt weight down my purse if I want to carry it in there.  Its pink.  Its made of sturdy metal instead of plastic, like my other three cameras were.  The buttons feel sturdy and it has a super-easy user interface.  It takes great photos, and I was even brave enough to take it out of auto mode with the help of the instruction manual.  One thing I love about Canon is that instead of cramming all the different manuals (language wise) into one booklet, there is a booklet especially for English!  This means I can discard the other book and only have one small manual to put in my camera bag. 

I suggest going to a store and handling it a little bit before ordering to make sure it isnt too small for your hands.  I have larger hands and it seems to work OK for me, but I can see how some people might not like the size if they are used to a larger camera.  It is always a good idea to look at electronics in person before buying, but the prices in the stores were much higher than Amazon.  I was not able to see the camera in pink in the store, so I was a little concerned that it would be too pink or not pink enough.  It ended up being a great color, not so pink as to be annoying or to stand out.  It doesnt look like a toy.  Macro mode is excellent, and battery life is great.  I love that it has image stabilization built right in because it means that I have fewer blurry images to delete.  A perfect camera to carry with you everywhere!   </Content>

<Content>I bought this for my husband for his Christmas present. Dont think hell like the fact that its pink in color but for an extra 10 dollars for a photo printer he will just have to accept it. 
Ive always been a strong supporter of canon cameras. We have had a canon ixus 40 for more than 4 years now and it still works fine. Just wanted an upgrade. Seems the new model is a little flimsier than the one we have. The switch for switching between viewing, camera and video mode is made of plastic and is recessed. I find this makes it a little difficult to switch modes quickly and more inconvenient. The battery cover is also made of plastic now and seems like it would snap off very easily if you were too rough with it. 
I have yet to test it fully but i dont think itll be much of a disappointment. It came highly recommended from a guy who owns a camera shop. Plus canon cameras are the best in low light situations (for point-and-shoots). 
Great price with the photo printer bundle. Cant wait to use it. </Content>

<Content>This is my 2nd Canon camera.  This model the 1100 IS truly is a wonderfully built and nice looking blue camera that conveniently can be placed in my pants pocket without my really feeling that it is there.  I can have it with me all the time.  Picture quality is very good.  My older Canon SD300 still is a great camera but this one the 1100 IS has many features that my SD 300 does not have.  I am very happy with both of them although I am happier with the 1100 IS and would gladly recommend it.   Buying it from Amazon was the best deal and the delivery was fast.  I always check with Amazon for priceing, and also read the reviews from others to determine how good a product is.  I initially heard of this model from Consumer Reports and read their very positive rating on this model camera.  The price from Amazon was better than ebay and Costco!</Content>

This little camera is really great and all the reviews were right on.  It takes great pictures and the quality is better than any of my previous cameras.  It is easy to use and really good in terms of battery life.  I dont think I will ever use some of the features but they are fun to experiment with.  Ive recommended this camera to 2 co-workers and would recommend it to anyone who needs a great camera at a great price.  </Content>

Im disappointed with amazon, who sent me a pre-opened camera. It came with a ripped open Styrofoam rapper, and fine prints on the body of the camera. Though nothing was missing, its embarrassing to give this as a X-mass gift. It wud give the impression like I bought it, used it, then gave it away as a gift.

<Content>   I bought this camera for my wife. She wanted an easy to use point and shoot that delivers great pictures. She also wanted a compact size to drop in her purse so that it was with her at all times.
   The Canon PoweShot SD1100IS filled the bill perfectly. I checked all brand of cameras in this range and read both user and expert reviews. I am a fan of having a viewfinder as are many who have ever tried to see an LCD under bright light conditions. Many cameras in the range do not offer viewfinders. I also liked the 4X optical zoom. I settled on this camera and it has been the perfect pick. It is as simple as anyone could want and still offers flexibility for those who want to have more control of their pictures.
   I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting a basic point and shoot with great results.</Content>

Before taking any picturs, you tell the camera what you want, the kind of light your in, etc.etc. and it does the rest.  Pics are clean, clear and beautiful.

We are only amateurs photographers.  I like that this camera is very small and can fit in your pocket.  Its not much bigger than our cell phone.

<Review>
<DocID>B0011ZK6PC-403</DocID>
<Content>Ive always had an aversion to digital cameras but I finally broke down and got this, my first one, (!) at a fantastically low price during Cyber Week at BestBuy. I settled on the SD1100IS Elph after having done some research, reading scores of reviews and spending time comparing similar point and shoots like Sonys Cybershot, Panasonic Lumix, Nikon Coolpix and others. I kept coming back to this one because of the style, the compact build, the numerous favorable reviews, all of the functionality and the fact that it had a viewfinder which I thought would come in handy shooting in bright sunlight.

I think it would help to know my skill level as a photographer (none) and technical ability (pretty good with everything BUT digital cameras). So if youre the technical type and looking for how this measures up compared to other digital cameras from a strictly technical standpoint, you will likely want to skip this review!

As a rank beginner I had to start out slow, poring over the manual and learning the basics, then began experimenting by taking close-up pictures of my cat. At first I ended up with a lot of washed out shots of a squinting, irritable-looking animal. Luckily within 24 hours my knowledge and skill level improved markedly (see my image posts on December 14, 2008 - three pics taken in late afternoon in foliage mode make me look like I didnt just get started yesterday..and I did).

Having said that though, I still think you shouldnt let the point and shoot designation fool you. If you have never used a digital point and shoot, there is a lot more to learn than pointing and shooting. In fact its a pretty complex business to take great pictures, but this camera does help make the process as easy as possible. I found the biggest improvement I could make was learning to select scene modes for various scenarios (indoors, outside, etc.). There are so many cool features packed into this little wonder that it would probably take months to learn everything, but you can start taking pictures like a pro in a surprisingly short amount of time if you just experiment and then refer back to the manual when you need to know how to take a specific shot or figure out where you went wrong when they come out wrong. After having shot a few images that were overexposed (standing too close, should have turned off the flash); blurry (didnt follow the advice of pressing shutter button halfway down to let the camera focus first); or noisy - where I will experiment with adjusting the ISO settings downward) - I put the blame on myself and not the camera and I think rightfully so. 

Other pluses are its size - it is really compact but not so much that its hard to hold. You do want to put the wrist strap on and make a point of wearing it whenever you take pictures because its easy enough to drop. I liked that it came with a charger you can just plug directly into the wall without an adapter, and that the battery charged in less than an hour and a half.

Perhaps the easiest thing of all is installing the camera software on your PC and downloading images. The image transfer was nearly instantaneous -no waiting. And I really appreciated that every time I took a bunch of new pictures and reconnected the camera, I got a window asking me if I just wanted to download the pictures that hadnt been transferred to the PC yet. No hunting around for images and trying to figure out how to just separate out the latest ones to download. 

Another cool thing an advanced photogrpher will appreciate - and so will I as I learn more - is that in the ZoomBrowser application (on the accomapanying CD) you can review your photos and get detailed shooting information on every shot you take - shutter speed, aperture, light metering, ISO speed, focal length, shooting mode, image size and quite a few other things as well. 

If youre still on the fence about this, shop around and hold out for a great deal. I got mine at Best Buy and they threw in a 2GB memory card as part of the package. The 32MB one it comes with is a bit of a waste of time, as it will probably only hold less than 10 high quality images.

I will admit I hesitated a long time before settling on the Elph after having been scared a bit by the negative feedback on the fatal lens error issue. Doing some poking around into this, I think its something that probably happened in a small percentage of Canon point and shoots, and an even smaller percentage of this particular model. If youre worried, buy it locally and get an extended service protection plan. I did, and I figured it was worth the extra piece of mind for the under $18 a year for two years that I paid for it.

Not to get too far off topic but I experienced issues with faulty equipment in my Canon Pixma printer when it was brand new, and their customer service (via email) was lightening fast (we are talking a couple hours at most in each case) and they replaced the ink cartridges I needed fast and at no cost to me. I am of the impression that Canon is a great company and have only experienced excellent customer service each of the several times I have contacted them for help and/or advice.

If I had to pick one negative about this camera, Id say that the little door that covers the entry point of the connector cable where you hook it up to your PC or TV (for transferring/viewing images) is a really flimsy piece of plastic that seems like it will almost certainly bend off with regular use. They should have made this a sturdier component considering how often it is likely to be used.

I also surfed around for cases and thought the ones Canon makes are pretty ugly and cheap looking so I settled on one made by Olympus (the slim leather case in dark brown to match my bohemian brown Canon if youre interested) which is a tiny bit larger than the PowerShot dimensions. I havent received it yet but it appears to be high quality, well constructed item for under [...] at the authorized Olympus dealer on eBay.)

All in all, I am very pleased with the Elph so far and would recommend it to beginners and more advanced photographers alike.

<Content>I love this camera. My Olympus C-750 I still havent figured out how to take pictures without half of them being blurry after more than two years. The Canon I figured out in hours and it takes great pictures. The menus are very intuitive and easy to navigate. The LCD is bigger and the body much smaller than the C-750. Only thing it doesnt have is the 10X zoom, only 3x. From off to taking a shot is less than two seconds with the Canon where the Olympus took forever to turn on and had a terrible shutter lag. The Canon was also less than half the price of the Olympus, a big plus.</Content>

<Content>Compared to my previous three digital cameras, the last one also a Canon Powershot, the Canon PowerShot SD1100 Elph has a much higher pixel count, an optical zoom, image stabilization, face recognition for focus and much more compact size. The price is reasonable for what you get. I havent even tried the video mode. This also is the first digital camera I feel comfortable carrying around in my pocket as easily as a cell phone.</Content>

<Content>While looking for a replacement for my broken Canon 450D (My own fault: I lived on the beach for 8 weeks and didnt protect it well enough), I came across the entry for the Powershot SD1100IS, and was immediately interested. It cost about my price range, came with everything I was used to, and had some pretty good reviews. So far, it has been a great deal. 
I get great photographs with really good resolution. You have to be very careful about not bumping the lens, as sometimes it will get stuck in a focus loop and youll have to restart the camera, but that seems pretty standard for a semi-delicate piece of equipment. I am completely satisfied with my new little point-and-shoot!</Content>

Pros: Picture quality is excellent. Small (fits in a pocket). Easy to use. 
Cons: Slippery: There is a small cord that you can attach to the camera. Make sure you use it. This camera is really slippery and will fall off you hand easily. The lens is not well protected -- must take extra care when placing the camera in a bag.</Content>

<Content>I just got this camera yesterday after my sony cybershot was stolen. I have to say this canon model is waaaay better than my sony cybershot(although the cybershot was 3 yrs old). The canon has better features and takes better pictures. Plus you cant beat this price on amazon. I got this camera in bohemian brown, and wow it is gorgeous!!!! Its sophisticated looking. I didnt want silver because everyone has silver and the pink and blue are pretty, but wow the brown is nice. Its a deep chocolate brown with a hint of eggplant. Anyways, my favorite feature is color accent! My sony cybershot did not have that. But all in all, amazing camera for the person in their 20s who want to use it for going out or for vacations. although its fine for all ages. Dont hestitate, after so much researching this camera is worth it for the price range.</Content>

<Content>We are very happy with this purchase so far. Camera is easy to use and we find the manuals very user friendly. We especially like the viewfinder. After borrowing our sons pocket camera for a recent vacation, we knew we needed a viewfinder. His did not have one and on sunny days it was very difficult to tell what you were taking a photo of. Although you dont often need the viewfinder, it is definitely a plus in our mind. We also like that it has the rechargable battery. We bought an extra battery so we will not be caught without a charged battery. Although some like regular batteries, I feel it is too much waste and too many batteries being tossed in landfills. We feel we made a good choice with this camera. It has lots of features and is easy to use.</Content>

<Content>I recently upgraded from the SD550 (about 4 months ago) and loved that camera.  But that being said the SD1100 is significantly better.  With better ISO settings I can take pictures in lower lighting.  It is much lighter and has richer colors.  After 200 pictures I seldom take it off automatic.  On the older SD550 I used manual setting quite frequently.

Canon has made a great easy to use point-and-shoot, that also delivers good looking pictures.

<Content>I think Amazon needs to change to a 10 point rating system. I think giving this item 4 stars is not doing it justice but I cant give it 5 unless I thought it was perfect. 
I bought this after sampling numerous cameras in this size class. Its small enough to fit into a shirt pocket comfortably. I chose the gold color and it looks sweet. The controls and settings are not the most intuitive but not impossible either. The 2 1/2 screen is ok considering how small the rest of the camera is. I guess I would be real picky asking for 3 inches. The preview image that you get on the LCD is grainy but dont be discouraged. Its not the final result when the picture is taken. I must note that this camera also has a viewfinder in case you dont want to use the LCD screen. One of my main criteria was ISO settings and shooting pictures in low light. Indoors, this camera does an amazing job. All you have to do is set it to AUTO and it will give your exposures plenty of light around the subject. Its also smart enough to know when you are outside. Although, if you are not satisfied with the AUTO flash outside, then you can adjust the ISO manually. There is some noise with that but who cares?
As long as you shoot amazing pictures and this camera delivers. Another requirement when choosing a digi was the video quality. Ive made a few videos and Im impressed. This is actually better than some digital camcorders or at least on the same level. And to get that level in such a small package is remarkable. You can have fun with features like color accent or color swap. There is even time lapse video on here!
Another neat photography feature is panorama. I have to say that instead of in-camera photo stitching, you have to wait until you load the images on your pc and use the included software. Thats a bummer but its something I can overlook considering what else this cam brings. Thats one of my very few negatives along with the fact that you cant re-charge the battery without removing it from the camera. For the price, you get a lot of bang for your buck. Strongly recommend for the casual user who wants to take quick pics of people and landscapes. And when I say quick, I mean quick. This camera is ready to take a picture 1 second after you turn it on.</Content>

<Content>I absolutely love this camera.  I purchased the Canon PowerShot 1100IS after carrying my Fuji SLR for years.  I had no problems with the SLR, but it was entirely too bulky.  Therefore, I wanted something that gave me similar picture quality from my SLR, but in a compact.  After doing a little research, I purchased the 1100IS.  This has been a purchase that I have not regretted.  The camera has great manual controls which allow you to keep customize settings such as white balance, flash, timers, etc.  Another feature I like is the way the screen changes depending on the way you have oriented the camera.  My friends love when I carry this camera because it takes such good pictures.  Everyone who I send pictures of themselves or who Ive allowed to use the camera to take pictures wants to know where I got my camera.  I have had 2 or 3 express interest in going to purchase this camera.  You will not be dissappointed with this camera!</Content>

<Content>This generation Elph has hit a sweet spot: its about as small as it can get and still have usable controls, and its minimized some of the limitations of earlier generations: much less shutter lag, and snapshot focus is better with face detection.  It takes remarkably good pictures in available light, and is better than most of its size at managing the flash, so that interiors dont look as artificial. 
It doesnt replace my D-80 for serious photography, but having something that fits in a shirt pocket means getting shots at times when youre not out on a dedicated photography mission. Excellent value.  </Content>

<Content>I received my SD1100 last week - it only took 3 days with free shipping. Very impressed with Amazons shipping during the holidays. All that aside, I am also impressed with this camera! I shopped around and chose the Canon SD1100. Its so small and compact. Easy to take along everywhere but its still packed with all the fun features. I wanted to leave a review on the color alone. I really debated on the brown. Blue would have been my second choice but the chocolate lover won out. Its a beautiful deep brown color. The photo doesnt do the color justice. Its a perfect color of chocolate. I just love it and get LOTS of compliments on it. Highly recommend the Bohemian Brown color!</Content>

<Content>Pros: -compact and sturdy enough to hold and shoot without dropping.
      -Ideal for parents/elders who are not camera savvy
      -Excellent picture quality when compared to Nikon SD series and Sony coolpix series
     -looks stylish,esp. the gold color.
     -Image Stabilization really works! it is difficult to get a decent snap of my dog who never stays still and this time i got excellent shots with my cannon SD1100.
-Lithium battery life is good and lasts for around 200+pics

Cons: Flash setting are not accurate in certain light conditions. I ended up getting darker pics with flash on and vice-versa.(could have been my ignorance with the settings and I may have to read the manual again)
-Battery/memory flap is very delicate,needs extra care while opening and closing.
-takes more time to download the pics to the computer(I did not use the camera driver provided, I chose not to and it still worked)

overall a good product for the money and the deal with the camera+memory worked out excellent

<Content>We bought this camera to replace an HP r707.  So far, so good.  The Canon takes a really nice picture and even the video quality is pretty good.  One difference we have to get used to is that with this camera its not so simply a point and shoot.  You have to press the shutter button halfway down to allow it to focus for a second, and then press it all the way down to snap the photo.  But its really not a big deal.  The nighttime pictures come out really good as well.  The menu system is a bit more complicated than we were used to, and navigation isnt as straightforward.  When shopping for a new camera, we used the reviews here and also at dpreview.com.  On dpreview.com, this camera had the best rating in its price range.  Overall, its a great camera and a great price.  </Content>

They came out quite clear and beautiful even the ones taken from a car going 65 miles an hour.  The only thing that we were concerned about was the night time pictures, they came out too dark, we are hoping that its because we are still learning about the camera and what it can do, otherwise we are pleased with our purchase.

<Content>I bought 6 of these bad boys for work purposes. In the past, weve gone through many other brands of point and shoot cameras with mixed results (sony, olympus, nikon, etc). I can honestly say that the Canon PowerShot SD1100IS is the BEST point and shoot camera that Ive ever used. The images render amazing color and clarity. Everything about the pictures are sharp. For lack of a better word, these pics pop and give depth to even the simplest scenes. Low light conditions are a bit grainy at times, but Ive yet to find a good way of working around that. 

I just noticed that Canon came out with other IS (Image Stabilization)models with more MPs. They sound really nice too, but I cant say anything about their performace since Ive never used them. Do your research... I think youll find that Canon dominates the digital point and shoot market and for good reason. 

Bottom line: Awesome camera, amazing price, fantastic pictures, super easy and fun to use. Im officially a Canon fan for life. </Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera based upon the reviews from 
some of the more notable review sites and was somewhat
disappointed in the image quality both indoors and
under less than full bright sunlight.  It would be 
a great camera for a kid to play with but not especially
for a photographer.  All images appear fuzzy and soft 
to me under any situation other than ideal light. The 
start up time and focusing time is a bit better than 
the competition but thats the only advantage that I can
see in this toy camera. I have a 2 megapixel old Olympus
camera that takes sharper and better exposed indoor shots.

I guess the trade off is that if you want something that 
you can fit in your shirt pocket or a toy for a kid than
this would be a good choice.  This is not a camera for 
those of us who like sharp well focused image quality.

And what is it with the white balance?  AWFUL indeed!
All indoor shots have this yellow cast that I find 
objectionable.  Save your money and look at some offerings
from Olympus or one of the other manufacturers.  

I sold mine on ebay and bought a Finepix f50fd for about the 
same price.  The difference in image quality is like night and 
day.

<Content>I own an Elph SD450 5MP, which I thought nothing could beat for the quality of pictures and movie clips it took. I ordered this one to update my camera and was not disappointed. Canon photos tend to be bluish or dark but that is easily corrected in the computer or with the camera settings. I was pleasantly surprised by the clarity of photos, particularly when using the standard zoom. I also like the movie mode which has been improved over my 450. I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I hoped it was more compact, but it is a tad thicker and bigger all around than the 450. Still, its a great camera to keep in a purse or briefcase in case the perfect photo opportunity should present itself.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this product as a gift for my husband as an alternative to a Casio Exilim that he had previously purchased and was unhappy with.  He wanted a small camera that he could carry about with him that would take good clear photographs.  The features of this camera that he specifically wanted were: compact size, anti-shake feature, reliable brand with a good track record.  In short, from the product description and the outstanding customer reviews and glowing recommendations on this site and camera sites, written by lay men and expert photographers, I felt that this would be the perfect camera. Unfortunately, we didnt share the views of the majority.  In a nutshell, we found 3 main faults:  the image stabilization feature didnt appear to work as many of the shots that he took came out blurry/out of focus;  this camera relies heavily on the use of the flash, which makes it a problem with certain shots that you want to come out clear not using a flash feature;  the battery and memory card cover seems cheap and flimsy, which we didnt expect to find in a Canon, which are usually well built.  In short, it underperformed the Casio Exilim on the picture quality and fell short of our expectations but the camera that we purchased might be faulty.  We returned this camera because of these issues.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera to take on short trips when my DSLR is too bulky. For me, image quality in a camera like this is less important than ease of use and sheer portability.

This PowerShot is exactly what I wanted in a camera like this. The images are nice, the camera is quite small and very light. It is just small enough to comfortably fit into the front pocket of my jeans. 

The flash and zoom arent perfect, but this IS a point and shoot camera. I dont have any complaints about the photos from this camera. The rechargeable battery is great and charges quickly. 

My previous point-and-shoot had a terrible shutter delay. This camera does a nice job of taking the image right when I press the button. Its not quite as responsive as my DSLR, but still very good.

This one does take short movies, but the quality is not great. Dont buy this thinking youre going to take lots of home movies. Its good in a pinch or to capture something random, otherwise, skip the movie feature.

<Content>Great camera for the price.  Small, durable, compact, easy to use.  Would like a few more options with the flash to turn manually on and off as needed, but other than that really enjoy it. 

The video function is pretty clear, so much so that were probably going to postpone getting a video camera until our baby is a little older.  

This is my 3rd canon digital and I have an underwater olympus and find the pictures and light adjustment (auto) is much clearer and accurate to true colors with my canon.  Just really like this camera.  Im a surgeon so I use it in the OR often for cases I do.  Good macro function.  All around compact, crisp and clean camera.

Would buy again.</Content>

Face recognition technology really works as the camera almost immediately identifies faces in the frame and automatically optimizes settings for them.  Auto focus is very quick.  Control settings are very intuitive.  And a critical factor for me ... a view finder.  And one that is synched to the zoom.  A great little camera.  One negative ... it ships with a tiny memory card so youll need to buy a bigger one.</Content>

<Content>Great versitile camera for the amateur wanted to take good pictures but I have one serious gripe as stated in the title.  No USB charging support means that you have to remove the battery and put it in the wall charger in order to charge the battery.  More troublesome is that if you leave the camera connected to your PC to upload photos and then forget about it, it drains the battery.  I cant tell you how many times Ive uploaded photos one day to find my battery dead the next when I want to use the camera again.  Perhaps theres an auto shutoff feature but I havent found it.

<Content>Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Blue)                                   I bought this camera from Amazon.com for $164.00.  It is a real nice little camera, mostly made of metal with a couple of plastic doors to its outputs  Battery/memory card compartment.  I also bought the PSC-1000 Blue case  a Hi capacity SD Memory card, ScanDisk 2GB Extreme lll SD Card.  I wish I had bought the PSC-55 case which I feel looks a lot nicer.
I have owned this camera less then a week  so far no problems.
I wish it had a rubber feel on the edges, like most cell phones have. Its real easy to stick in your pocket  not have to drag around a camera bag.
The Menu is easy to use but takes practice to see what all the icons stand for.  Dont bother calling Canons Help Desk at they are useless.  They only read from the Book you are looking at.
The Battery charger is nicely made  takes 1-1/2 hr to charge.
I set the camera in the Auto mode (which I am sure most people who buy in this price range use) Flash to Auto, anti shake On, face detection On and resolution at L  compression at super fine.  Those are the top settings  if you want to Email any of your pictures after downloading to your computer you can always knock down the resolution.
I did not install the Canon computer Software since I download straight from the Memory Card. 
When turning on the camera you need to be careful that you do not interfere with the lens extending.
I think this subcompact camera is the way to go unless you are a pro or think you are a pro and want something like a $1000  up SLR.

<Content>This is a great little point and shoot. Its small enough to easily fit in a pocket and takes fine pictures. My one gripe is its default to crank up the ISO automatically in low light. Unless you switch to manual mode and specify your desired ISO, the camera will switch to 800 ISO and youll get a very grainy image (assuming youve turned off the flash). That complaint aside, the camera takes outstanding pictures in daylight, captures good videos, has very good battery life and has places the controls where theyre easy and intuitive to access.</Content>

This camera replaced an SD 850 which was twice as expensive and had the unfortunate lens mechanism failure after 15 months (3 months out of warranty).  Otherwise that camera was great.  After researching reliability I decided to get the PowerShot SD 1100IS.  I liked the simplicity and overall features so much that I got a second one for our daughter.  Both were purchased through Amazon, and came with free shipping and a competitive price.  Very happy with photo results.  We used this camera for a recent 3 week cycling tour in France, and the size is perfect for tucking into a cycling jersey or handlebar bag.</Content>

My only negative with this camera is that when taking pictures indoors, they come out dark when set on Auto.  I am not a camera expert so I am sure there is a more effective way to take indoor photos, but for now, mine just dont come out great.  However, even if I knew that beforehand, I would have bought this camera anyway.  I am a satisfied customer.</Content>

<Content>I think this camera would be a great choice for someone who is looking for a cost effective digital PS and will be only taking photos of posing adults. The features it offered were pretty neat, I really liked the option that focused on one color and made the rest of the photo black and white. Very neat. Now for the bad, my unit was slightly defective (I assume), all of the photos were slightly out of focus, resulting in fuzzy images. But most of the reviews of this camera rave about the picture, quality, so I assume that my camera was defective and an anomaly. The other issue this camera had was the delay between telling the camera to take a picture (i.e. pressing the button) and the camera actually taking the photo (i.e. the image is captured). The camera had about a 1/2 second delay between the two events. This sort of delay is completely acceptable if you are taking photos of adults who know to hold their pose. But if you are taking photos of 2-year olds, forget it. All you get are the backs of little heads. I guess it is possible that the delay in my camera was a result of the auto-focus defect. But then I went to Circuit City to compare my camera to theirs (to make sure it was defective), I noticed that the Sonys were far faster than the Canons. The DSC-W150, DSC-W170, DSC-T70, and the DSC-T77 all were noticeably faster than the Canons. All of these cameras though are more expensive than the Canon SD1100, some much more so, and they also require special Sony proprietary memory, which costs extra as well. But I must say, if you are taking photos of young children, I highly recommend that you try one of the Sonys. They are the by far the fastest cameras out there.</Content>

<Content>I bought a Canon on recommendation by friends and family who have various Canon mini camears (e.g. Powershots, Elphs, etc).  I have to say that its all around great camera that takes high-quality photos in most settings.  Even in the darkest settings, the shots come out clear and bright (with flash of course).  The only time that the shots dont come out superb is when trying to capture something in lower-light settings from a considerable distance - in this case, the shots come out dark though I think they can be tweaked when downloaded.   When you factor the size of the camera and the low price, this camera is a winner all around.</Content>

<Content>I bought this because I wanted a small digital camera for basic everyday pictures and it has been great.  It takes good shots, is easy to take places (it fits in the cell phone pocket of my purse) and is easy to use.

The battery life is awesome, I have only had to charge it once in the last three weeks, and I have taken tons of pictures.  

The only drawback is the memory card that comes with it only holds 13 pictures, so I upgraded it to a 2G one that will hold hundreds.

Love this camera!  Have noticed many other people with the same one, and the love it too</Content>

She keeps this very compact camera in her pocket to capture things that they might do.  She is also able to take videos of them jumping and laughing, for example.  My youngest daughter is an artist and she frequently takes pictures of her artwork to show me what she is up to.  She too enjoys being able to store this small camera away in pockets or purses and not have a lot of bulk.  They tell me it is very easy to download and send pictures/videos from this camera.</Content>

<Content>This is a fantastic pocket camera that takes great photos and really good quality movies. Most of the other reviews accurately rave about this. 

Here is what I dont like: Canon, in my opinion, made a poor choice with their movie file format (AVI). 

I was in the market for a compact photo/video camera that I can easily carry with me for those casual evenings in the park with my 18 month old toddler or settings where you might not need HD quality video or SLR like capabilities. My SLR (Canon Digital Rebel XT) and my video camera (Sony HDR-SR5) were too bulky to lug around for such occasions. I was considering Flip Video Camcorder, but that seemed to lack good photo qualities.
 
Since most of my family lives far away, I also wanted the ability to easily share my home videos on sites such as youtube.

Movie mode records in AVI which results in HUGE files. They should have used MPEG (H.264)that uses compression while almost retaining the movie quality. A 35 second movie takes up approximately 68 MB of space whereas after conversion to another format such as WMV (using windows movie maker), it takes only 4 MB with an almost unnoticeable quality loss to my untrained eye. 

The implications of choosing AVI over MPG (or other compressed file type) are:
1. Your memory card will fill up in no time (an empty 2GB card will allow 16 minutes of video)
2. You will have to convert it (compress) your video before you can upload a 5 minute video to youtube.

I understand that this is a camera and not a camcorder, but a simple change of format would make this device almost flawless!</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera recently to replace my 2003 HP digital camera and could not be more pleased.  The camera itself is small enough to fit comfortably in my pocket and so easy to use that anyone can do it.  For those technically challenged (somewhat like myself), turn it on, point and click.  The camera does the rest.  It also has other features for the more advanced photographer that are easily set.  My 6 y/o son took a fantastic picture of a beautiful architecturally rich building in sepia through the car window as I drove by-- its that easy!  I highly recommend this camera to anyone needing a good, easy-to-use version that takes excellent quality pictures. It easily competes and out performs other cameras with a much higher price tag.  --And the Bohemian Brown is by far the most attractive color of all those offered in this line!</Content>

<Content>This is my 3rd Canon digital camera. I have been impressed with Canons products including two other high end camcorders. This little SD1100 has great optical and electronic features that you typically find on higher end models. Particularly the capability to zoom in and out in video mode(that many other cameras dont support). The only thing that I dont like is the thick multi-language user manuals that is about 5 times the weight and size of the camera. To me, I do not mind downloading manuals from the web site when I need it. Save trees, Canon ......</Content>

I bought the camera for my mother and I have been using it for over a week now. Great cam, with great quality photos and easy to use features. From my old Nikon and Fuji I think the Canon is a gud change. I liked my oldies too, but this I fear is even better. As far as point and shoots go I would think Canon is The Brand to go for and the SD 1100 in particular is a great cam for its price. </Content>

I dont know if it is this product or some other circumstance. My only other complaints are I had a Canon s500 before and I enjoyed the separate manual picture taking setting. In this one it takes more fiddling to get to the manual setting. Also this one if the flash is turned off it is not as good at using the available light to take the picture. Still takes beautiful pictures. You need to buy a bigger memory card if you chose this camera, the one they send with it is close to useless. </Content>

<Content>Just got this camera as a supplement for my other Canon, which is too big to just throw in my pocket like this can be. I am very happy with the size, weight, and images so far.I would say it is the same size and weight as a deck of cards, I might try a card case as my camera case! The materials of this camera are very nice, with only a few problems for me right now. The entire case is made of metal, except the battery cover and cable port cover. I think the battery cover should have been made of metal also for durability, and it is a bit weak in holding it shut; seems like it will be easy to open it accidentally, but the battery is held inside with a notch, so its just annoying for now. And on the front, it would have been nice if the silver rings that make up the lens assembly were a matte finish instead of glossy to match the rest of the camera. Flash works good, 2-3 sec btwn shots, and 1 sec startup time, so fast!

Otherwise, I look forward to using this little toy for some great snapshots. Will update in the future.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera in August, 2008, just in time for my two week trip to Morocco. So far the camera has worked great and I have had no problems. I spent a long time researching cameras and I had narrowed it down to Canon or Sony. Then I chose Canon and was deciding between the SD 850 and the 1100. Those two were both in my price range and had optical viewfinders. I went with the 1100 because of its smaller size and the color choices (I didnt want plain ol silver). The camera takes great quality pictures. I havent noticed any red eyes (thanks to built in red eye reduction) and the pictures are crystal clear. I like all the different features of the camera and shooting modes, even though I havent had the chance to use them all yet. I would definitely recommend this camera to those who care about great quality pictures, extra features, and a compact camera with color choices.</Content>

<Content>I love this camera. Opened up, charged battery, put in 4gb SD card, and away I went. Ive shot many pictures and videos with it. Videos are so easy and great. My daughter loves viewing them on the camera after taking them. Shots are great. The digital zoom is great as well. Fits in top pocket, take it to work even. Battery still shows full charge. In a nutshell, its very compact, long on battery life, excellent pictures and video. A very versitle take along camera for anything. Ive used it a lot more than my Nikon D40 DSLR.  The Image Stabilization is the way to go on any camera now. Another big plus on this camera is the screen in back. Large, easy to see in any light, and has the scratch resistant covering. My cat knocked it off the kitchen island, dropped 4ft, and didnt phase it. Seems rugged too.  Im very happy with this camera, was definately a good purchase for price. </Content>

<Content>I purchase a Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera on 08/25/2008 and am extremely pleased. The image stabilization has been a huge benefit in having this camera. Prior to this purchase, many of my photos were blurry. This camera makes it possible to snap quick photos with very high quality. I also love the color selection tool! You can take photos that highlight only the color(s) you want to see. For example, on a recent visit to San Fransisco, I was able to capture amazing photos of the Golden Gate Bridge. The pictures are in black and white, and the red from the bridge is the only colored element of the photo. It was very cool! And everyone is amazed that MY camera took those photos. They look professional. I am extremely pleased with this camera and would recommend this to anyone who is looking to make a new camera purchase.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera to be used for an convention and during the convention it has gotten the fatal lens error problem. I have only had this camera for about 5 weeks and hopefully amazon will replace it or Canon will cover it in warranty. I really thought this fatal lens problem wasnt a problem but it is. I hope I get a new one and sadly enough I cannot take pictures for this convention I am at. I suggest stay away from this product. I will change my review if things are fixed.

edit: Called up Canon and they were very helpful. They took a look at it and repaired it free of charge so it ended up only costing me the shipping cost which was about 12bucks with insurance/confirmation. Would rate 3 stars now due to good support and decent camera but known faulty issue should be considered in buying this camera. </Content>

<Content>This is a great camera that as most everyone has stated is easy to use.  It is very compact, provides great pictures, and feels very comfortable in your hands.

I bought this to supplement my Canon 5D DSLR for the unexpected point  shoot photo ops which always come up!  

I also recommend that you get an extra battery and some extra SD cards if you dont have something with you to move the pics to.  

This will fit just about anywhere.

The only down side is that you cant adjust the various settings for aperture  shutter speed.  But thats why I have the 5D!</Content>

<Content>I went from a Canon 60 to the SD1100.  I am a novice at photography but this little camera makes it easy to shoot great photos both outdoors and indoors. I just came back from a vacation in the Black Hills of South Dakota and took about 75 pictures.  All of them turned out great!  Even the digital zoom pictures I took of Mount Rushmore turned out great. I love the size (fits in a small case on my belt and feels when shooting and I have large hands.
Great camera!</Content>

<Content>My SD1100 actually froze up and died soon after I got it. Thats the first time in 4 Canon purchases that Ive ever had a problem. I quickly replaced it (Amazon did a refund - very risky to shop for cameras elsewhere on line). The large display is great. As compared to my last pocket camera (3.2 mp Canon sd300??) some of the features I used quite a bit (panoramic/stitch) on the old one are a bit more challenging to locate on the newer cameras. A new learning curve.

I have a 30D that I use for serious photo work, the purpose of the sd1100 is that Ill always have a camera on me without a bag of camera equipment. If something should happen to it, Im out $175, instead of $3k. I take this hiking, on the lake and climbing. For the dollar, the 8mp is MORE than enough. Paying more for 10mp just doesnt make any sense.</Content>

<Content>I am in love with this camera.  My last camera was also a Canon Powershot, which I bought 5 years ago.  Not more than a day after I got this new Canon in the mail, I was telling all my friends and family how much I am enjoying it.  Its small and easy to stick in a pocket, but the larger view screen makes it easier to compose shots and check the results.  The stabilized zoom is one of my favorite features.  Ive caught some fantastic shots of my four year old that I never would have been able to get on my older camera.  The image stabilizer takes the shake out of the action shots and removes issues that crop up from wind or just your own hand movements.  My pictures are coming out with better quality and higher resolutions (so I can enlarge whatever I want).  Finally, the battery life in these newer models is amazing.  I have taken nearly 300 pictures in the last week and never had to recharge the battery.  I purchased a second battery from Tech Fuel and with the two put together, I dont think Ill need to be worried about having my battery charger on me all the time.  I am still amazed that this great camera was less than $200.  I couldnt be more satisfied. </Content>

This was the most important feature since I really like to have the option of not using the screen. I love the camera and the quality is very good, as Consumer Report had rated it. The only accessories I purchased with the camera are a protective case (only $15) and a 4GB memory card.  I like the battery and charger that comes with the camera. I am totally satisfied with my purchase.</Content>

<Content>Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Pink)  This is an excellent pocket-size camera with many features that advanced camera buffs can take advantage of.  I like the large screen for viewing the subject of my photo and when the sun is too bright to use the screen I opt for the viewfinder (which most other cameras do not have).  The camera is easy to use and I have taken great photos of fish in a large aquarium,Las Vegas buildings at night, and other people and landscapes with excellent results. It takes movies too.  This camera is worth considering when buying a new camera.</Content>

<Content>We purchased this to replace a Lum*x on which the LCD screen stopped functioning (and which does not have a viewfinder).  After some research, we decided on this blue Canon mainly for its size, viewfinder (!), 8MP sensor, and picture quality ratings.  We have been very happy with the color accuracy (especially when compared to the pictures from our previous camera), and that it performs well at exactly what we need it to as casual users - point, shoot, and churn out great photos.</Content>

The image quality is good at 8MP, the LCD is bright and good size, and I got about 150 shots over three weeks before getting a low battery signal.  The controls take some getting use to but there are a lot of options for the amateur photographer.  Its not an S5 or SLR but for under $200 you get good images (and options) from a tag-along camera.</Content>

We are both almost illiterate of modern day electronics. She wanted a camera that was easy to use but still produced good clear photos. The reason that I picked the SD1100IS Canon powershot was because of the many positive reviews and also the great low price.

<Content>I received this camera a few weeks ago and have been satisfied with it.What I wanted to do with the camera was simple.Take varies pictures and keep them on the computer.I also take a few short videos.For that the camera is perfect.
It fell from the bed once,which is about a two feet drop and I was glad to see it didnt break apart or make the camera malfunction in any way.
The only thing Im disappointed by is the fact that when the subject stands four feet or more away from the camera its very blurry.And forget about taking a full body shot.All youll get is basically a blur.It does work with small children.My niece is three and I can get a pretty good full body shot of her.
Over all Ill give it four stars.</Content>

<Content>Overall this is an excellent camera.  I upgraded from a Nikon coolpix 5600 which  was not a bad camera except for the painstaking long shot to shot time.  This one has a much faster shot to shot time compared to the Nikon which makes a word of difference in taking pictures of kids.  The in camera red eye fix works great and leanring how to navigate all the functions did not take long at all.  My previous camcera used AA batteries, which is one feature I liked so if I as travelling and ran out of batteries I could quickly buy a new pair of AAs.  This one has a rechargable one and AFter having the camcera for a while I have yet to need to recharge it.  However, I did purchase a very inexpensive generic backup battery which I also keep witht he camera just in case.  I am very happy with this camcer and if you looking for a compact very functional camera that takes great pictures I dont think you can go wrong at all and highly recomend this camera.  Also the price on Amazon.com was the best one I could find anywhere.  The local stores had it on sale and Amazon.com was still ~$25.00+ less expensive.  Shipping was very fast even with the free super saver shipping (got it in few days from time of order).</Content>

<Content>Im an avid Canon fan and recently purchased this camera (in blue) for its compact size.  I own a 40D which isnt so practical to carry around for everyday use, especially with my battery grip on it!  I previously owned (a now ancient) S40 compact camera - which in comparison is not-so-compact.  The SD1100is is amazingly small and light in weight.  It features a viewer which I think will come in handy (and has) in bright light situations where the screen does little or no good.  The 2.5 screen is plenty big, although noticeable smaller than the 3 on some of the other models.  I think the viewer is worth the small trade off.  IS is also an invaluable feature especially with low light situations or non-flash moments.

The main issue I have heard of with this series is with potential lens harm if the camera turns on accidentally while in its case.  Its pretty hard to do since Canon has now made this on/off button flush with the body.  But, my best advice to avoid this situation is to make sure the camera is in play mode (vs. camera mode) when you put it back in the case.  This will prevent the lens from zooming out upon turning on.  Im not really worried - this has not happened to me yet (well, in the month that Ive been carrying it around . . . EVERYWHERE!)  

Navigation is easy to pick up on this one - quite different from my older S40, but easy enough to figure out even without reading the manual.  I do suggest buying a spare battery to have on you just in case, especially if you plan on using the video mode (which is really good) since it sucks life quickly from the battery.  I also bought a 8GB HCSD card and reader to go with it to make room for quick videos of my kid :-) and pictures, of course.

Other than that, it performs like I expected.  The flash is not the strongest, but then, its a pocket camera.  If youre looking for more strength from a flash, youll need to go with external flashing - on a different camera as this one doesnt have that option.  Knowing its limitations, it does the job for the everyday moments when you wish you had a camera.  </Content>

<Content>Usually I do not take the time, but I felt obliged to write a review for this camera. Thats because it took me so long to decide which one to buy. I am a point and shoot type of person with a side of wanna-a-be photographer.  So, I wanted a camera with perks but easy to use.  So far I really like this camera.  My old one was a Nikon cool pix.I liked it well enough, though it was a gift so not personally choosen. Anyway, I dropped that one in the river. I really wanted a canon but was concerned about the lense errors I had read about.  I think its just something you have to stay conscience of. I bought a case and I havent had any problems.  As far as picture quality, its pretty sweet.  I love the macro mode for close ups of bees and flowers and hummingbirds. However, it works great for regular pictures too. You can set it to where it makes chirping noises or barking when you shoot which is funny for kids. Also the video is really good. It only had 3x optical zoom which is another reason why I hesitated. But, I havent found I miss it for how compact the camera is.  Even with the case it fits in my purse good. I would advise you use the wrist strap always b/c it is small and could slip out of your hands and then you would probably bump the lense and get the lense error. I got the blue one and I love the color - makes it easy to know its mine cause most people have silver.  Oh yeah, I really like the different settings. It has a sunset, beach, foilage, snow, action, black and white, sepia tone, etc. I use the sunset setting every night to take a different picture of my lake sunset and its beautiful.  Ive found the battery life is fine, especially if you use the view finder instead of the screen.  The Nikon I had before came with a dock and tons of cords to charge it.  This one has a battery-only dock the gets plugged directly in the electrical socket.  Way better for everday use and trips. Ive only had to charge it once so far and its been over a month. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it. Especially because it was at a competitor for $50 more.***I almost forgot: in order to view your pictures on the camera the switch must be set to view mode.  If you are concerned about the camera turning on in your purse, turn it to this mode and then push the power button off.  Then, if it gets turned on accidentally, the lense will not come out b/c it is in view mode! (:</Content>

<Content>I already own a Canon XT, which I love, but I found that, because of its size I never took it along with me all the time and missed some great shots. So I bought the Canon SD1100IS to take with me all the time. I love this little camera. Its easy to hold, has more bells and whistles than the XT and takes great photos. I also love the movie clip feature and the large LCD screen (which I miss in the XT). I bought a case for it with a neck strap so that I dont have to carry it when Im empty-handed. The downside of the camera is that Im used to having an SLR with virtually no shutter lag, so its hard to go back to having a camera with it. That means that I have to be careful when shooting moving objects so that theyre always in the photo (which sometimes becomes an interesting dilemma). Although the camera has a slow shutter speed setting you cant really adjust the shutter speed. There are set features for kids and pets, night shots, foliage and even fireworks, but youre pretty locked into the shutter speed they select. That said, the camera performs beautifully and takes great photos, equal to that of the XT. A great buy for the money!</Content>

<Content>I ruined my `Nikon 7900 7.0 megapixel camera after three great years by getting it wet.  This was upsetting as I had the SCUBA encasement for that model and a ton of accessories.  My nephew turned me onto the `Canon SD1100 (as it also has an optional SCUBA encasement) and I am very happy.

It has one more megapixel (8.0) capacity for crisper pictures (up to 16 X 22 prints), a larger 2.5-inch LCD monitor and tons of extras.  There is an Optical Image Stabilizer which reduces the blur of any camera movement, even with low light.  There is also a cool feature called, Face Detection WB which means the camera concentrates upon faces, then it calculates white balance for the best colors and tones.  You can also just select ONE face among the group to highlight (think Birthday parties)!

There is a cool red-eye correction that identifies and corrects red-eye when pictures are taken.  You can also later detect and correct red-eye during image playback.
 
The camera is smaller and thinner than my previous Nikon and it fits very easily into any pocket (be careful!).  Its quick, easy and responds readily.  It is a great value for the price.  The pictures are just as good (maybe better) than my old camera.  I cant wait to go diving now so I can try the underwater encasement (accessory).  You can also buy a less expensive underwater encasement accessory for up to 15 feet of depth for snorkeling and there is a waterproof encasement accessory for rainy day shooting.

<Content>I researched forever!  I was reluctant to go from my Sony to a Canon.  The feature color accent was my deciding factor (take a black and white photo, but highlight one color in the photo like a red shirt or blue eyes.)  I have used this without reading the manual and feel pretty comfortable with it.  Love the size.  A little problem with more red-eye than my Sony camera.  Maybe I should read the directions though.  Would buy again!  Very pleased.  Purchase with an additional rechargable battery!</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera in April. After using it for a while I realized there is always a blue dot in the middle of my images. It becomes more obvious as I zoom in. The blue dot is everywhere: on my photos and on my video. I sent the camera back to Canon Factory in IL for repair and when it came back it still wasnt properly fixed. I just contacted Canon again and see what they will do about my camera. I am not sure if its only mine camera that has this defect but I hope they would give me a new one if it cannot be repaired.</Content>

<Content>This is a fabulous camera! Ive been a fan of Canon for a long time, but this camera is leaps and bounds above my last one. Its very small, the zoom is great for a small camera, and best of all the time from turniing on the camera to taking a picture is a fraction of a second. You wont miss a photo op with this camera. Theres also great turn around time between pictures, and a very short delay from pushing the button to taking the picture, which has been a problem with digital cameras in the past. You wont regret this buy. </Content>

<Review>
<DocID>B0011ZK6PC-581</DocID>
<Content>Good looking, compact and affordable. But compared to my previous (4 yrs old) powershot, think its regressed a bit on usability. 

Firstly for a camera of this size the click button is positioned a little too far away from the edge, Ive got to stretch my finger to get it - not very ergonomic. Secondly the menu is unintuitive, for example I keep forgetting where the menu option to change the scene mode is located. Had to check the manual quite a number of times to figure out where things are. These were much more intuitive with my previous powershot. I hardly had to refer its manual for anything, even considering the fact that it had less features to contend with.

Having said all that I dont regret buying it... its light, fits in my pocket and the image quality is great! Just hope Canon would improve on those minor niggles.</Content>

<Content>Great colors, easy to carry, excellent pictures, very good modes. Could only be better if it had manual control for exposition and aperture. Please, do believe in all good reviews you read here. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that pictures are way too grainy when using high ISOs. However, once you start keeping your ISO down, your pictures will look great. I used to have a great, great camera with complete manual control over everything, until it died and went to the cameras heaven. It took me about one full week of research until I finally decided for the SD1100IS. All this time researching has definitely  paid off. Highly recommended!</Content>

The features are straight forward and easy to use, so you wont have to spend 2 weeks reading the manual before you can use it. I especially like using the Color Accent feature, you can get really creative with it.  The pictures you get are crisp and clear, and it also does a good job with video.  I would definitely recomend this camera if you are looking for small, easy to use, point and shoot.</Content>

<Content>Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom. This is a very good point and shoot Camera. I had a Kodak point and shoot (a $200 camera five years ago) stolen from me in June and this was the replacement. Im not compairing the two but there is a pro and con here.
The Kodak was my very first digital camera and I thought it was the greatest. It was only a 3 MP with a 3x zoom. I used the crap out of that camera and it never failed me. I probably have taken 15,000+ pictures with it. I researched many point and shoots to replace it. The best one I found for the price is the Canon SD1100. I went to a Best Buy and spent an hour playing with all the cameras. I wanted one that would power-up real fast and be very quick between pix. This was the one. The clearity of the pictures are awesome. Color is great, operation is easy, fun to use. I have taken about 500 pictures and they have turned out very good. My favorite aspect of this camera is the Macro. It is so tight. When I look at the final pic, it is crazy tight. I really am pleased with it. My only issue I have with the camera is I cant do a fill flash. I do a lot of car shows and need a flash for interior shots. (The Kodak was flawless on the fill flash) Overall I really do like this camera and would definitely recommend it. Absolutely the camera to go in the shirt pocket for the quick dont miss that picture. Money very well spent.</Content>

<Content>This is my first digital camera.  I bought it to record my family vacation in Yellowstone. I also bought a 2Gig memory card ( $25) and a second replaceable battery ($8 + 10 SH).  

I basically shot all pictures in M2 mode ( middle resolution), in automatic.  I was surprized to find I could take about 2000 pictures ( many more than I had expected) with this memory card.  During the week in Yellowstone I took over 200 pictures.  They all look great on my 19 in LCD monitor.  I never had to change batteries. ( I did turn the camera off when ever I was not using it).

The camera has a lot of features that I have not learned to use yet.  I did use the indoor feature to shoot the hotel room and the inside of Old Faithful Inn.   The are also lots of other modes that I have not tried ( pets, fireworks, night time,etc ).  If I had wanted to I could have gone to the trouble of making panoramic picutes by stiching automatically linked pictures.  This seems too much trouble from my snapshoots. 

It did a great job for what I wanted. Out of the box ( mostly) point and shoot.  I did have to read about 20 pages in the manual to get the basics and I did have to load software into my computer  and learn the right settings to more pictures from the camera to the computer.  But everything was pretty simple. </Content>

The memory card with which it comes, however, only holds about 10 pictures.  You will need a bigger one and can get it as part of a cheap package.  I didnt see these type of packages on Amazon which sell the camera, a 4gb or 2gb memory card, and case together.  I would have purchased that.  I purchased a 4gb card separately which should hold about 1,000 pictures.

<Content>Now that Canon and its rivals are offering numerous compact and ultracompact point-and-shoot cameras in the 10-12 megapixel range, the price on this 8 megapixel unit has dropped dramatically. But dont be fooled by the notion that more megapixels is better -- in this class of camera, its not necessarily true. Unless the sensor is larger, which it generally isnt, you will often not see any difference in the 10 and 12 MP cameras. In fact, you might get more noise. You are also likely to get a longer delay between shots. So if you are buying a high end digital SLR, sure, go for 12, 14, or now even 16 megapixels. But for a point-and-shoot compact, 7 or 8 MP is more than adequate.

This model offers 8 MP, face detection, and a variety of shooting modes that can be easily selected from a menu. It provides excellent results for everyday photography. It is also extremely compact and easily fits in a pocket or purse. If you want a camera to take along wherever you go, this is a must-have. Its also an incredible value, now available for as little as $160-$180.

If you buy this camera, note that it only includes a 32 MB memory card, which holds roughly 10-12 photos. You will certainly want to purchase a good, fast card. The SanDisk Extreme 4 GB works great and will hold over 1000 photos at the highest resolution (1800-2500 at lower image settings). You can now get one for $30-$45.  Also, you may want to get an extra battery. Lenmar makes a good Canon equivalent that you can get for about $10. (Beware of no-name knockoffs that cost $2 or $3!)

Overall, excellent ultracompact point-and-shoot camera. Get this item to have with you all the time. (And save up $1000-$3000+ for a high-end digital SLR if you have serious, semi-pro photography needs).</Content>

The only problem is that the memory card that comes with the camera doesnt have much capacity - I averaged 13-15 pictures and then it was full.  You have to get a much larger card right away - its not an option - so that adds to the price of the camera.</Content>

<Content>I am a Canon fan and started out with a Canon Elph S400 and loved it.  Last year I got the Canon SD1000 as an upgrade and I was surprisingly disappointed with the picture quality (maybe I got a dud or something because there are good reviews on it).  

Anyway, I took my chance upgrading to this Canon SD1100 (I figured the IS would help) and I am ecstatic!  It takes amazing pictures (MUCH better than my SD1000), the sophisticated brown color is great, and is a good size.  The nice thing about the camera is that it doesnt show fingerprints like the SD1000 did.  

Overall I highly recommend this camera if you are looking for a simple point and shoot that takes great pictures all the time.</Content>

<Content>This camera is unremarkable in its output, but is rich in features. It makes a good traveling camera, but if you decide on it, Id set the image compensation to +1. Set at zero, the images tend to lack contrast and rich saturation. This is true with most cameras, both digital and print. The extra boost in exposure fills in shadow detail and boosts color saturation. Owners also should invest in a copy of Adobe Photoshop Elements, if they dont have it already. 

If you can cart around a slightly bigger camera, it should pay off with better quality photos; but if you want to travel light, this is as good a way as any.

<Content>Just got this camera for a vacation trip (before the big price cut! bummer.) Spent the last two weeks taking well over 1000 photos on a 4GB card. Have never had my own digital camera before, but have used my friends cameras and also purchased a Canon A630 for work about a year ago and use that occasionally. Basically, Im the kind of user who never really wants to think about the picture Im taking and expects the camera to figure out the right settings so I can just press the d--n button and get a great shot. Thus the Auto-mode on a camera is 10 times more important than all the scene mode options, because 95% of the time the camera is going to be on auto, and by the time I remember that a scene mode might be more appropriate, its too late anyway.

From that lazy novice perspective, this is an awesome camera. It did almost all the thinking for me, and just allowed me to point n shoot. People, buildings, boats, skies, ocean, insects, sand, friends -- pretty much everything came out without any adjustment. 

Comments on pics: Im slightly red-green color blind, so I cant comment on the color fidelity of the shots, but these are all adjustable on the computer afterwards anyway. Focus was fantastic, with two exceptions: once when I needed to pick one non-centered boat to focus on in an array of boats at various distances, and I hadnt bothered to learn how to pick and lock focus from the manual. And should have used the infinity focus lock to take pics/video of a show in a dark theatre where flash was forbidden and the auto-focus assist lamp couldnt find the stage 50 feet away. This was the only time I got a series of blurry shots. I did use the night snapshot mode a lot to take pictures at night. That was my one concession in my expectation that the camera figure out everything. A couple times I turned the flash off because the flash was too close to someones face and kind of flattened his skin tones and natural shadows.

I also want to point out that I have very unsteady hands, and I made little or no attempt to keep the camera still when I was shooting. Not sure whether the image stabilization feature or the high ISO capabilities kicked in here, but I very rarely got a blurry shot unless both the camera and the subject were in rapid motion. Very happy. And never saw significant noise in my photos, although Im not particularly sensitive on this issue.

Comments on ergonomics: small camera, lighter than my smartphone, fit into pocket. Pretty easy to hold in one hand and take photos. Slightly slick surface left me worrying that it would slip out of my hands, so i often used the wrist strap.

My one wish has to do with the zoom range of the lens: its not very wide at one end, and I often found myself inconveniently backing up to take pictures of houses. And the 3X telephoto end wont get you close up to that sea otter you spot out in the ocean surf. The Panasonic Lumix TZ series is fantastic in both of these areas, but I really didnt want to sacrifice the Canon idiot-proof simplicity, compact size, and great auto-focusing capabilities.

Comparisons to other cameras Ive used or played with: Its faster and smaller than the Canon A570IS I bought for my parents 6 months ago, although the A570IS is easier to hold steady because of the big grip. Personally I would have preferred to use AA batteries like in the A570IS, but the battery life on the SD1100IS is great so far and the charger is tiny and light, so easy to pack for a trip. I think the IS image stabilization feature is critical for shaky hands and casual on-th-go one-handed shots, which gives it an advantage over amazing cameras like the A630. We use the A630 at work to photograph everything from building problems to new member portraits, and its great but heavy as a brick and triple the size of the SD1100IS. I do love that articulating LCD screen, tho. It was impossible to take discreet snapshots of people on the street with the SD1100IS -- chalk it up to pointing a pink camera in their direction, directly at eye level. With the articulating LCD you can pretend to be just fiddling with the camera while getting great spontaneous shots of your friends.


All in all, a brilliant camera for someone who really does NOT WANT to learn about technical issues of doing photography. Plus, at the current price its a total steal, over fifty bucks less than I paid at the camera store just three weeks ago, and that was on sale!</Content>

<Content>Recently, my wife had purchased another brand of digital camera because she was finding it harder and harder to find inexpensive to mid price 35mm cameras. Unfortunately she did not come and talk to me first who over time has owned four different digital cameras over 12+ years and shemade a purchase from a guy behind the counter in a department store. She has been very frustrated with what she got finding it complicated and non-intuitive.

After a couple of months, and bearing the brunt of her frustration with the digital age I decided to take things into my own hands. I began to do the research and settled on the SD1100IS after a fair amount of research and reviews. I offered her the substitution and the opportunity to use the 1100IS. It is a hit.

She finds the organization of the buttons and functions much clearer and simpler. It is not over loaded with features or complicated options. She prefers the rechargeable batteries because the other camera ran through AAs like  a bear at a picnic. She finds the viewing screen much less susceptible to black out from glare and if necessary she loves still having the option of the peephole viewer to shoot through.  All in all she is now very happy although she is unwilling to wade into the world of uploading pictures to the computer and will still keep Kodak happy going to the picture printer at Walmart.  I guess it is one step at a time.

I am impressed with the quality of the pictures, the color balance, the excellent macro function, and the speed with which she was able to adapt to this camera.

All I need to do now is to figure out how to get rid of the first camera she bought. </Content>

<Content>I bougth a SD1000 last year for my wife, but our daugther basically take it for herself, so I need to buy another camera for my disatisfied wife. I was happy with the SD1000, so I choose this model thinking it will be more of the same, an I like the new colors too.
After some weeks of use, I could say that this is a better camera, it feels more solid, with better materials. The photos are better, not only because of the IS, but with the overall quality (I have made some prints and I think all photos look better).
I dont give it 5 stars because of the limited manual controls. It is a very good, may I say excelent, point and shoot, but if youre interested in experimenting with your photos, you may want to buy another model with more manual controls.</Content>

I was looking for a simple easy to use camera that takes great pics. Thats exactly what you get with this. Very easy to use. Very easy to download pic and video. Small. Im sure there are many more functions this camera has but I havent needed to use them. The image stabilization is automatic and is a must have function. </Content>

<Content>I love this camera! I can be over whelming at times but a couple of extra minutes and exploring and you can figure many of its awesome features. There is so much this camera offers that you can edit and send straight to printer. This is even easier since I have a Canon Pixma IP4500 that allows direct connection with the camera through pictbridge feature. All these features and so much more packed into a nice compact package.                 </Content>

<Content>This is an excellent camera and very easy to use and get adjusted to. Also makes viewing pictures very easy. I like how it is so compact and fits snugly in a small camera case. Also, I love having a chargeable battery as opposed to a camera run on batteries, as this gets tedious to replace etc. Definitely worth every penny!</Content>

<Content>Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Gold)
Canons Powershot digital Elph answers all my needs. It is small enough to fit in a shirt pocket. Its 8.0 megapixels are large enough for large prints. And it is one of the few small digital cameras that has a viewfinder, so that you can hold it up to your eye, if you wish, rather than look at the screen. This is good for bright light situations and for saving battery power. Besides, as an old film photographer, thats the way I like to work. It works well on the automatic setting, but has all the options you could ask for, including movies.</Content>

Photo quality is great, first and next shot delay is fantastic (which was a major concern because the toddler doesnt wait!)and the functions are all intuitive - who has time to read the manual?!

Also, just got a new laptop that runs Vista and there were no problems with compatibility.

<Content>I bought the Canon 1100 because I wanted a small camera to take everyday photos.  I chose Canon because I wanted a viewfinder, and I felt its buttons were a little easier to use than the equivalent Sony.  (A purely subjective choice.  I felt a little guilty playing with Best Buys cameras, then making my purchase online!) After taking a lot of sample shots of our cats and house and then taking it on vacation, I am very happy with it.  The zoom works fine and even long-shots without flash werent too blurry if I braced my hand.

It has a lot of features that I probably wont use, but Im glad to know they are there in case a special situation happens.  (Im the type of person who reads through the owners manual as soon as I get a new product, and plays with it and experiments so Im familiar with its operation when I really need it.) 

We have an old PC operating system (Windows 98) and it was challenging to find the appropriate card reader to put the photos on the computer.  But photos printed fine when we were all installed correctly. 

This is my first digital camera (just weaned myself from film!) so if I can operate it easily, anyone can.</Content>

<Content>I got this camera 3 days before leaving on a trip so I did not have a chance to learn how to use it before leaving. I took the instruction book along to be able to learn about some of the features. 

Instruction book is very poorly written and if you do not know how to set up a camera it will be worthless. 

During the trip I got better at taking pictures. The basic mode (point and shoot) is adequate, but the zoom, no flash and so on settings are not hard to figure out and I used them extensively. I found that it did not take good pictures out of a moving train (blurry), so if you want to use it for something as sophisticated as this buy something else (may be I need to look deeper into the instructions).</Content>

<Content>Not going to try to compete with the highly obsessive (but informative) fellow reviewers except to say Im pleased with this feature rich, light, small, ergonomic, 8MP image stabilized camera with a (now hard to find) optical viewfinder.

Ive always wanted to do time lapse video. This, like most canons, apparently, will do 1fps for up to 2 hours (20 minutes will net 40 seconds of capture - use tripod or set on stable place and work on your crossword puzzles). 

The regular VGA quality video is great with good mono sound. And Ive been pleased with the quality of the photos shot at the fine quality setting. Handles shadows and tonal values well. 

This SD1100IS is a pocket rocket for features - the manual (all in English) is over 200 pages. You NEED to read it to get the most out of it, but of course you can just start on Auto and do OK. 

Size was a major consideration and this beauty sits in a belt case I had and takes very little space. I use with an 8GB SD card now, so the skys the limit!

I recommend you give this serious consideration if you have some of the same requirements I did.</Content>

<Content>This camera is very small and fits comfortably in ones hand. Small changes in the cameras body make it feel smaller than one of its earlier predecessors, the Powershot SD 600 even though the actual dimensions are pretty much the same.
There is much to love about this camera, but the most important points are: its small size, robust metal body, decent picture quality and surprising array of functions, which let you shoot under a wide range of conditions and override (or fool) many of the automatic settings. To make the most of this camera you need to read the manual carefully because many cool features are deeply hidden.
My only complaint is the use of a special rechargeable battery. I like to take my camera on extended trips and after a about 250 pictures I have to hunt for an AC outlet (with my other camera, a Powershot A710 IS, I just pop in two new AAs). Thats when the (pretty cheap) optical viewfinder comes in handy.
The image stabilizer is nice - the usefulness of the face detection algorithm is debatable, but its presence sure doesnt hurt.
In summary, its a great point and shoot camera. I have it in my jacket pocket almost every day.</Content>

What I want to add is that the software that comes with it is amazing. The camera has a function to help you line up panorama shots, and the CD that comes with the camera has a program called PhotoStitch that will stitch the peices together into a panoramic picture. It works great! The program senses by itself where the pictures should line up and puts them together; for far away views you cant even tell where the pictures were stitched together. Its amazing. </Content>

<Content>This is a great buy account it is almost $30 cheaper than what I paid for it almost 1 month ago. Other than the fact that I wish it had a longer zoom, I am very happy with it and the picture quality. I love the fact that this camera has an optical view finder NOT an EVF and that you do not have to rely on just the LCD screen to take your picture. The Manual is not hard to follow and it is easy to find everything.I would also suggest buying the Tamrac 5680 camera bag if all you need is a bag and the ability to store an extra battery and memory card. The Sandisk Ultra 3 4 GB gives me almost 1200 images with the camera set at its hightest settings.

<Content>from another site, lets call it xest xuy said the camera could be recharged. and by my not going to the store, i find out now you have to take the battery out to recharge it. one of the big reasons i picked this one over many others was i thought i could just plug it in to the wall with a cord like my mobile(cell phone). 
plus something i am sure i will have to live with is i have to hold down the button for so long it make the picture not spontaneous/fun any more.i have missed six pics so far.

now to the good
the camera is so small it fits in my bag no problem. i was with my boyfriend today and took some pictures of cars for him (sneaky like)

<Content>I had the SD1000 (also a very nice camera)and decided to give that camera to a relative. I bought the SD1100 and it is a high quality compact camera for a relatively low price. I like the size because I can take it almost anywhere. My daughter will be taking trip to Ireland and I bought her one as well. I have a NIKON 1200 (high end camera) but truly only pull that out for weddings or when I am taking photographs of the kids for school. This little camera was all I used for my daughters birthday party and the pictures turned out great. You cant go wrong if you want nice pictures and dont want to pay a lot of money for a high end camera (which tends to be more complicated to use if you really want to get a bang for your buck.)</Content>

Most importantly this camera takes wonderfull photos with great colors that are very clear and sharp. We bought a 4gig memory stick for it and there is room for plenty of photos with a crisp and clear resolution. One thing is for sure, no matter how much your hands shake you will still be able to take great shots with this camera with the image stabilizer turned on.

<Content>Purhcased this camera ~ 8/17/08 for spouse and very glad i did.

She is going on vacation with her girl friends and we didnt have much time to make decision on which camera to buy nor time for learning curve on how to use.

She wanted:
Something small and compact thats easily to carry

Easy to use point and shoot ( no messing around with menus )

Good battery life so she didnt have to recharge or change often

No latency ( wait ) between taking multiple pictures back to back

Stylish

Takes GREAT PICTURES

The Canon SD1100 IS 8MP delivers.
I really enjoy this camera.  Super easy to use.  Battery life seems pretty good ( ill get her separate battery though for backup ).  Stylish design.  Compact yet feels good in ones hand.  Buttons work for both her little / petite fingers and my extra large hands.  Pictures look great so far.

Items really like:
a. starts up fast after pressing power on button
b. lens retracts automatically after minute of no use
c. optical stabilization ( havent noticed any blur in low light pics )
d. no latency between back to back pics ( possibly due to fast memory )
e. battery life appears to be very good
f. recharging battery takes only 1:30 hr:min
g. good zoom both during pic taking and when viewing afterwards
h. very intuitive and easy to learn all features

Looked at following in stores: Coolpix 600  550s, Canon, Casio, Olympus.

Money wasnt an object.  I really wanted to get her the best compact camera that was easy to use, durable, etc...

This camera met and/or superceded all our requirments and needs and its very inexpensive ~ $185.00 US. 

Added Bonus, there are tons of excellent ratings on web for this camera, so one cant go wrong, unless your needs require something this camera simply isnt designed to do.

I recommend purchasing larger memory than what came with camera:
32MB is complete inadequate
2GB  is adequate
4GB  is completely acceptable

However, I purchased the Patriot SDHC 16GB Class 6 memory yesterday because it was so inexpensive.  Used to cost couple hundred dollars.

Paid 59.99 + tax. 

Ive had no problems with Memory. I didnt have to format memory. Simply inserted it into camera straight from package. Its fast. Im able to take 8M pictures back to back without any hesitation or delay. 

So far movies are working fine too.

# of pictures with 16G: 
4599 8M, 3264x2448, Superfine 
6266 5M, 2592x1944, Superfine 
9641 3M, 2048x1536, Superfine 
9999 2M, 1600x1200, Superfine 
6040 WS, 3264x1832, Superfine ( WS=Wide Screen ) 

Its not weather proof / water proof / shock proof like some of the more expensive memory. However, i dont plan on using it in extreme conditions anyway.

<Content>I am a camera-holic and like to get a new one every year or so. And I travel a LOT. I dont know as much as the real geeks here, but I know what I like. This takes wonderful pictures, does a great job of steadying my picture when I dont take the time to be still, and the colors and pictures are consistently outstanding. I like having a viewfinder and lots of cameras dont. Shutter lag is not a huge problem, although there are still times I miss a shot. 

And my camera is the color of chocolate, although the stupid salesman said the color was, well, something else. (He didnt get the sale)

I will say the battery drives me nuts. Very hard to charge because it falls OUT of the charger and I have to tape it in. But once charged, it holds the charge for as long as I need it. 

The controls arent always user friendly. I hate to look things up in the book. But the basics are easy on it and that is what I stick to.

<Content>I cant say anything about the Canon Powershot SD1100 IS that hasnt already been said... but thats never stopped me before, and it wont now. 

First a tip; When shooting videos, there is a 4GB maximum file size. For this reason, I use several 4GB SDHC cards, rather than one larger one. That way, in the rare event that a card craps out, youre not sitting on the shoulder, you have a spare tire. And two 4GB cards are often cheaper than one 8GB. 

But understand that a 4GB card will hold well over a thousand photos at even the highest quality, so if you dont care about videos, just use your old, smaller SD cards. (but not the tiny 32MB one that comes with the camera... its useless, and not heavy enough to use as a paperweight or big enough for a coaster). 

This is a decent little camera, compared to the competition at its price level. Its popularity, and overwhelmingly positive customer ratings, attest to that. 

But nothing is problem free, and this complex product is no exception. 

Its inevitable that there will be a certain number of product failures and customer service problems... sort of like the ones I had with Amazon during the ordering of this product... multiple calls with promises but no resolution, made me want to smack my head against the wall. Giant waste of time, but thats how it goes sometimes. 

In their defense, they have done well on other occasions. I will continue to buy from them if they save me money, but my advice is to know exactly what you want before ordering, and dont even think about making changes to your order... its like opening Pandoras Box, pandemonium will ensue.(slap forehead, denoting irony, and wring hands in frustration). 

I see complaints about the camera, and some are valid. But some are not, like, (paraphrase) Its too difficult to turn off the flash. 

I dont see how it could be easier, unless someone invents a camera that you can change the settings by thinking or willing it to change. You press the flash symbol with your thumb to view modes (auto,on,off), press again to set preference... it literally takes one second, and is about as complicated as lifting a toilet seat... and much cleaner. 

However... I did not perform hands-on tests of multiple competitors of this camera to compare complexity and intuitiveness of controls, so all I know that this camera is not as simple as my old 3.3 megapixel Sony DSC-S75. 

It takes some time to learn dozens of features, modes, and controls. I am a computer guy, some (me) say a good one. I have MCSE, MCP+Internet, and A+ ratings. That means that I am both a software and a hardware genius, LOL.  

However, I can tell you that both you and I will have to show more than a little bit of dedication to learn all the tricks and abilities of this camera, and the more you learn the more fun it is. But the manual is 225 pages, so turn off Jerry Springer and start reading. Its worth the effort.

Alternatively, just reset to full auto defaults and go to town immediately. 

This camera wont perform like a digital SLR, but SLRs dont cost $200 bucks and they weigh a lot more than 4.41 oz. I bought this camera to be able to carry it around in my pocket 24/7, and in my opinion you cant reasonably do that with anything even slightly larger or thicker... even the chunkier Powershot SDs are too big. Again, only my opinion. 

If not for that, I would have gone for the thicker Canon Powershot SD890 IS with the 5X ZOOM, which is also half again more expensive, of course. 

I read a lot of reviews on the internet before choosing this unit. I have had the camera for a couple of weeks. After learning the features, I spent a whole day burning it in... as I said above, I have two 4GB SDHC cards plus a 2GB SD card, and two spare Lenmar batteries in addition to the Canon battery that came with the camera. I smoked that sucker, continuous mode with flash. I took hundreds of pics and lots of videos, including the time-lapse variety, cool. I like it. Homey says five stars. 

ADDENDUM, after spending more time using the camera, possibly belaboring some earlier points;

At this writing, about 93% of buyers give this camera a 4 or 5 star rating. Now, some of the complaints from the other 7% are valid, like the one that states that the color swap feature doesnt work very well (but who cares, really?)...

But others are not, like the one that states that the time-date stamp doesnt appear until you print out... clearly, the time-date stamp appears very nicely when you review the photo in-camera. 

The PDF users guide for any camera is readily available from the manufacturers website for any camera, and you should read it before buying to make sure that the camera has the capabilities youre looking for. 

Also, its a good idea to at least read the same information in the users guide booklet that comes with the camera after purchase... something that some buyers clearly dont do. And with the number of features programmed into this and any other comparable camera, you are bound to have difficulty if you try to wing it.

<Content>Ive been testing and looking at cameras in this price range for weeks, and although you can get more megapixels for the price in other brands, dont do it! This one easily beats out EVERY other model in this price range. Compared to a 10 megapixel Fujifilm camera, this 8 megapixel camera takes FAR better pictures, with finer detail, and better quality all around.

Also, this camera takes phenomenal macro shots, has excellent response time, and its totally sleek  cute. I highly recommend this camera! </Content>

<Content>The very camera + 8gb sdhc card + spare lenmar battery that I had ordered 9 days prior, and USPS, as always, drops it off on my front door step, on a busy street, for the entire world to see.

Imagine this... Its 4:08pm, Im in my hotel room 40 miles away from home relaxing. My girlfriend is a bridesmaid doing her thing with the bride. I just finished kicking off my shoes, putting things away in the room, and wolfing down a huge chicken sandwich. The wedding is scheduled for 6pm and will be taking place on a yacht in Newport Beach, CA. As in a boat that will be floating away from the dock at 6pm sharp. Meaning you had better be on time for this one!!

Well imagine my disgust, when I decided to hop on mobile web 2.0, and login to my amazon account to check shipping status. USPS tracking sucks by the way, and best as I could tell, it would be here on Monday, not today (Saturday). NOPE! The magic words appeared right there on my cell phones tiny 3x2 inch screen..... DELIVERED. YAAAAAOOOUUCCCHHH!

Boats departing in 1hr 52 minutes, Im 40 miles away from home. What would you do? You guessed it, turbo mode ENABLED. I was dressed and on the road in less than 2 minutes! Needless to say I made excellent time, while simultaneously obeying all traffic laws.

When I finally arrived at home, I was ecstatic to see the package sitting on my doorstep! It probably didnt sit too long, but believe me when I say this, in my neighborhood it would not have lasted long, certainly not overnight till the next afternoon! 

Well, NO TIME to familiarize, aka play with toy. I tore open the amazon package with the force and gusto of 100 rats. Strait to the charger  battery, I know what needs to be done. The charger  battery are on the wall, and Im changing into my suit which I brought with me from the hotel. Sweat beads were building, and before long I had a full on sweat-a-thon on my hands. Unbelievable!

A 15 minute charge is all I was able to muster. It was time to leave now, or Id be left standing at the dock! I Grabbed the camera (8gb card inside) and the charger + battery pack off the wall. No time to be neat, all this stuff goes in my pockets, LETS GO ALREADY!!! Luckily I was able to plug the address into my nav phone, which was a total life saver on this day. However, I was 30 minutes away from the boat and not in a good position to make it on time. At this point I was really starting to worry.

5:58pm and Im stuck in horrifying traffic on Pacific Coast Hwy, just having got off the freeway, I was less than a quarter of a mile away!! It was at this point that I began to pray, you know the one. The Dear Lord Ill do anything if.... prayer. Yeah that one. Well the Lord answered my prayer on this day. Even though I pulled into the wrong driveway. The driveway I was supposed to turn into was the previous one!!! I pulled into parking, and was VERY surprised to see my girlfriend pulling in right behind me! HUH! I beat YOU! WOW. So I helped her bring on board some parting gifts, and even though I was one of the last ones there, I was one of the first on the boat. Made it, unreal!

Theres still another dilemma here however, and this is Im stuck with a camera I dont know anything about! Oh well, AUTO mode, and pray that Point and Shoot MEANS Point and Shoot! Luckily the layout of the camera is very user friendly, and it only took a few seconds to realize the basic functions of the camera. I also decided not to turn on the camera until it was time to shoot, because of the short charge time. One thing that did kinda irk me was the fact that red eye reduction is not set by default factory settings. So The night ended up with quite a few red eyed pics. The red eye could easily be removed in photoshop CS3 though.

After going through the images the next day, I was extremely happy with the quality of the images. I left the camera in full auto mode that night, and will let the pictures speak for themselves. I was also very suprised that I took nearly 150 pictures on such a short 15-minute charge. 

I hope you enjoyed reading about my little dramatic experience, and hope you enjoy the pictures produced by this wonderful LITTLE camera.

<Content>After much research, I settled on this little camera for three reasons: (1) It produces surprisingly good videos, (2) It has an optical viewfinder which makes it easy to operate in very bright sunlight and allows one to hold the camera close to the body--and hence less camera-shake, (3) It is small enough to fit into ones shirt pocket. All of the above were my criteria for a camcorder to use unobstrusively in a country where tourists are the target of gangsters and crooks, and where a regular camcorder would be very tempting. A bonus: excellent photos for a point-and-shoot!</Content>

<Content>I absolutely LOVE this camera!!! Its so tiny, so easy to use, and the pictures are absolutely gorgeous. The camera itself is beautiful, too. 
The zoom function is great and so is the image stabilizer. There are all sorts of great effects, including fun ways you can play around with color, enhancing certain colors, or shooting in black and white or sepia. You can also make sound recordings and video recordings. Ive had a few cameras and this is the best one by far, even better than a much fancier expensive one  I bought earlier this year.
I have only one complaint, which is that the Users Guide is disorganized and hard to understand, with pages referring the reader to other pages so many times that its dizzying. However, the camera is so easy to use, so intuitive, that this should not hold anyone back from getting this fantastic camera. </Content>

These used to be great cameras but obviously parts lately coming from who knows where need a serious boost in QA to fix this lens error problem, but thats for the next sap, im done with canon</Content>

<Content>I got this camera a little over a month ago. I still have a lot to learn. I like to try and play around with buttons and features before reading the manual. I still havent read a lot of the manual so this is just from experience.

Cannons are excellent cameras. The only reason i decided to replace my older cannon was because I am getting married, going to Hawaii and I wanted something a little newer/better for the trip of a lifetime. 

My old cannon still works fine and i plan on keeping it as a backup. 

Ok- on to my review.

Battery life is excellent. I had the camera for over a month, used it a lot (especially playing around with the new features) and finally just had to charge the battery. I bought a spare battery so i never missed a shot.

The flash is great- I seem to always have red eyes in every photo when a flash is used - this one is one of the better red eye reductions. I only had red eyes in about half the shots (which for me is great)

There are a ton of different options as to how you can take your photo, (indoor, outdoor, beach, sunrise, color swap, fireworks, pets, kids etc etc) I thought this was neat, but according to my friend who is an artist, this is just a gag they use to sell more features. If you put your camera on auto it does all of the same things.

I havent experimented enough to say if this is true or not.

I love the size of the screen - its definitely larger viewing then my old cannon however it still has a viewfinder - which i find important when owning a camera - sometimes in the dark, using the big screen is useless, you cant see anything on it, or sometimes when you ask other people to take a picture of you - they are not used to using a digital camera yet- this allows them to use the viewfinder like a regular camera and take a decent photo. Also if you god-forbid drop your camera on vacation and the screen breaks, you have a back up till you get home (ive seen this happen to people)

Transferring photos to my iphoto program in my mac is really simple, just plug in and it goes!

I have only played around with the video function a bit. I think it seems fine. If i wanted to take really nice videos i would use a video camera, but for an on the spot use- this is a great little video  camera too!

Thats all i can think of for now.

Cannons never disappoint in my experience!

I love how user friendly it is, I havent needed to open the owners manual once since I got it a month ago.  Everything is very straight forward and simple to navigate and the photos speak for themselves.  This camera is also extremely light weight and comes in some pretty funky colors.

<Content>I just returned from Europe and took over 1500 images and videos with the wonderful camera. I have a neck strap and keep the camera handy my my chest pocket. This works so smoothly. When wishing to grab a quick shot I just pull it our and is seconds it is on and ready to take a picture, video, or record audio.
     The face detection works well and if the shutter is pressed half way down the face will be highlighted and sometimes enlarged to show you where the focal point is. The exposure will be on the face most of the time so if the back ground is bright you will have a properly exposed face. This works especially will if the person(s) are close to the camera. I have taken some beautifully exposed faces all over Europe under some difficult lighting conditions... back light or total darkness. 
     The image stabilization really helps in dim lighting like in museums where you might like to take photos of art hanging on the walls. No flash is permitted so the IS really helps. In large churches that are often dimly lit one can rest the camera further on a bench or stable surface for further help with long exposures. 
     I took and extra battery and swapped it out every 4 days or so to keep the battery always ready for a shot. This worked all but one time when I took about 200 shots and a few videos and ran out of battery.
     The Amazon price is one of the lowest Ive seen. In Europe they are about 225 to 250 Euro or about 300 to 400 American dollars, so we get a very good deal here. 
     The 2 Gig memory cards work fine and store a ton of information. I recorded picture tags with the camera to place audio clips with the photos at concerts, family reunions, travel directions and friends voices  telling stores. I just aimed the mike on the front of the camera in the direction I wished to record. It was fun to playback the audio at a later time and relive the moment.

I still havent figured out all the features but it is easy to just turn on and start taking pictures.  I also purchased a screen cover from another vendor and the Canon case.  Both have been very useful in protecting my purchase.  It only comes with a 32mb card (I got 13 pictures out of it) but I was expecting that and already owned bigger SD cards.  I shopped around a lot before I bought and this was the best price also.  </Content>

<Content>I have to edit my review because I am having problems with this camera.  I will save my positive comments below, though.

I love this camera so much.  I have recommended it to everyone I know.  Well, now I am regretting that because I have only had the camera since July (4 months), and I am getting Lens Error messages. 

When you get a lens error, the camera beeps and the lens will not come out.  Canons website does not have any solution for this on their website, but I found a lot of people had the same problem when I searched the internet today.

I am supremely disappointed because this camera is so great in every other way.  I am now telling everybody I know not to buy this camera because I dont want them to experience the same problem as I am currently having.

-----------------------------------------------------


I have a Canon PowerShot SD550 camera that I used for a few years, and I was ready for something new.  

I love Canon cameras.  The buttons are very user friendly.  This camera was rated highly on Consumer Reports.  You can take pictures quickly with this camera, which is a big plus for me.  

I also love some of the things you can do in the color settings.  You can choose one color as an accent color, and it turns everything else black and white.

The flash works really well...you can take a picture in a dark area, and still get a great picture with the flash.  And its not one of those flashes that blinks 500 times before taking the picture!  

Plus, you get to pick between several colors!!  This is a great camera for the price!</Content>

<Review>
<DocID>B0011ZK6PC-670</DocID>
<Content>I did a lot of research before purchasing this Canon camera.  Yes, the quality of the photo is excellent and it has many features, however, I did not read one single review which commented on the problem that the date and time is not imprinted on the photo when reviewing the photo but can be imprinted when printing out the photo if selected.

What good is a photo when the date and time is not on the photo.  Nikon and Casio camera imprint the date and time on the photos taken.  The user has the option of turning off the imprint should it be necessary.

I work as a residential property manager and frequently photograph rental units after the tenants have moved out in order to prepare the refunds of deposits.  I have a nice Nikon 5.1 MP but the shutter time is extremely slow.  I end up having to wait 5 seconds before being able to shoot the next photo.  You can imagine how frustrating it is to spend time waiting in between shots.  

The problem of not having the date and time imprint when I download the photos on my notebook makes my work very difficult.  I only print out photos when necessary, therefore, if I move the original photo from the memory card to my notebook computer, I can not print the photo with the date imprinted.  The date can be imprinted by connecting the camera to the printer and selecting this feature.

Do not purchase this camera if you need the date and time imprinted on the photo without having to print.  Get a Casio Exilim because the quality is just as good and the menu is user friendly unlike Canons.

Canon needs to go back the drawing board and add this important feature. </Content>

<Content>Let me start off by saying I like this camera! I got the cool blue color and that just makes it that much more appealing for me. Although this is not the first digital camera I own, I can appreciate the difference this one is from my Olympus point and shoot. It is much smaller, easily to handle with the capture button being bigger. But mechanically, there is so much to learn that it would take a 5 hour study session just to become a novice user. The downside of that also means that when I learned to change the setting of color accent, I took a horrible picture of my face with the color accent on and now have not figured out how to change it back. Im still going to work on that. 
Just last night though I had left my camera battery in the camera since I did the first charge on it and when I went out for the night, I thought that I would have enough battery life. It was at 2 bars. But after the first 3 shots of the evening the battery signaled went red and that was the end of my picture taking. I didnt know though when it is in the red, the pictures you take would not be saved. This would be easily corrected had I just charged it even though I thought there would be enough battery life. It was going strong for much longer than I had anticipated it would but regardless those last pics that I took were good ones! 

I still would recommend this product to anyone that asks if it is good because in is worth the buy!  </Content>

<Content>I lost my older SD1100is due to my carelessness and thus had to come and buy another.  I refuse to replace it with anything else out there.  

The 1100is is the smallest digital camera with all of the features that Canon provides in this price range.  $159 bucks gets you an excellent device with 8mp and image stabilization.  Honestly, if you are printing small images 4x6 or 5x7 then 4-5mega pixels is all you will ever need.  Canon on this camera kept the 8mp but incorporated some awesome features.

My family uses this camera on a regular basis and apart from the occasional red-eye, we have no issues.  Did you know that you can actually view the pictures on the camera and remove red-eye before you transfer them to your computer?  Awesome feature again.

The zoom on the camera and the flash are plentiful and in my opinion do an excellent job for general day to day photography.  This is not a professionals digital camera...but I would not be surprised if some of them had one in their bag for occasional light duty work.

I wont go into details about what is in the box, etc...as that can be found on the product page.

One other thing I would like to recommend, is the EYE-FI SD Cards....we use a 2gb version that allows for wireless uploads to your computer and various image sharing websites....its a must buy.  Why I recommend it with this camera is that I have seen very little to no battery drain when the Eye-Fi card is uploading images to the computer via our wireless network or from hotspots in airports/McDonalds etc...  

See my review: http://www.amazon.com/review/product/B001ACXHXE/ref=cm_cr_pr_recent?_encoding=UTF8showViewpoints=0sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending

<Content>Outstanding product,the camera features seem to be unlimited, buy it after you do your product research since the market is flooded with cameras. It is VERY SMALL, this is not an issue for me, it fits in a pocket with room left over. The manual is clearly written, step by step (no steps left out- very good in all examples)the only issues and its minor, is the small print of the manual.
I love mine, bought the 8gig upgrade memory card, well worth it, allows you to take lots of pictures at the 8meg photo setting, before having to download the pictures. The camera case I bought was not that good, the magnet case lock does not work very well, but a rubber band around the case solved the issue. I do a lot of backpacking and bending over causing the flap to come undone.</Content>

<Content>This camera is one of the best price-performance ratio in the Canon Powershot line. It has more-than-sufficient 8 mega pixels and the image stablilizer and face recognition features and has a decent speed when capturing pictures. Even though you buy the camera based on the features and the price, the color of the body (mine is pink and the wife likes it since no one will want to borrow her camera again) makes it very unique and cute and makes it different among the common metallic gray color of the millions of cameras.  On the improvement side, it will be better if this camera has a larger screen size even if sacrificing the viewfinder then it is still more desirable.  The SD1100IS is highly recommmended.</Content>

<Content>My delivery from Amazon was fast at the best price anywhere, but the battery and memory card packages were flopping around in the box because it was inadequately packed and the corner was crushed -- luckily the camera seems to be ok. 

Let me jump ahead of myself to alert you: ***if the screen goes black when you turn the camera vertically, put your hand up to your ear and remove your polarized sunglasses!!!***

The (reddish) brown is butt-ugly but reduces glare from around the viewfinder. The plastic doors are unimpressive, I hope they hold up. The buttons are simply arranged and well thought-out among monitor displays, menus, and functions. I wish the lens started out with a wider angle. The body size is nice and small, smaller than I expected from the product photo. Startup, shutter reponse, and recovery are still too slow. Movies are easy to shoot.

Special-feature-wise you can easily set up color accent, color swap, sepia, dark or light skin tones and get obvious results. Other custom color settings changes are barely noticable. Stitching pictures that overlap in any way can be done in their verrrrry slooooow software. I often need to take two shots with different readings because the meter cant manage sky detail and shade detail in a single shot. </Content>

<Content>I moved from an older Kodak Easyshare camera to this awesome camera. It takes amazing pictures no matter what, and has a setting for almost everything (you just have to take the time to figure out how to use all of the different settings). It is a perfect size to carry with my in my pocket and seriously always takes good pictures- even if it is an action shot. Sometimes it does seem like there is a little bit of a delay when taking a picture, but that really doesnt bother me at all because its worth it for the great pictures. The only slight problem I have had is getting my pictures to my photo editing application on my computer (I have a Macbook so Im sure it would be fine on Windows), but I eventually figured it out- its just kind of annoying. But besides that, this is by far one of the best cameras on the market for a GREAT price- I am thrilled to have it and definitely could not go back to any other type of camera. Canon is the best!</Content>

<Content>This was a great camera--until it stopped working completely within 3 weeks.  There was no incident or warning... but half an hour after making some movies, I went to turn the camera on and I got the message Lens Error, Restart Camera.  Ive tried everything, and I cant even retrieve the photos onto my computer.  

So even though I expect Canon to replace this camera, since I bought it for a trip and cant take any photos, I am really bummed that it stopped working.  I think they must have been using a cheaper manufacturing process, and we are all paying for it.  Ive used Canon products for years, and I support the company...  but I strongly recommend getting a more reliable camera than this one.</Content>

<Content>I got this camera for my daughter (in pink of course) in mid-April. She loves it (size, pictures, etc.) but after less than three months it will only flash lense error, restart when its turned on. Too late to return to Amazon. :( On the bright side, a trip to Canons website support section got me through to a Repair Request Confirmation. Hopefully, this will just cost me postage to Elk Grove Village, IL.

Suspiciously, Canon doesnt list this model on their repair request input screen... makes you wonder if theyre trying to discourage the onslaught of these that theyre getting back for repair.

it did have an screen error message after a week and half of using it but that is the AMAZING thing about AMAZON, returned it and they sent me a new one...just like that!

<Content>After some delay by Amazon who never ship the extra battery which I bought together (Someone must be sleeping on duty!!!) and they took 8 days (instead of 2) for complete delivery with no compensation for delay.  Why should I pay the school fees for Amazons mistake (lesson)?

Fortunately, the camera lives up to its expectation and the experiences is great so far. I have used many different cameras (Sony, Kodak SLR, Fujifilm etc) but needed a ultra-compact for daily job.  First, I would like to highlight some weaknesses:

1) Mechanical Noise - whenever the button is pressed during photo taking, the motor starts working and there is some noise of adjustment inside.  It is clearly audible if you are using the viewfinder.  I wonder if it will shorten the lifespan of the camera?

2) Tower of light - when you try to take a shot at night with low visibility, you will notice vertical tower of light from bright road beam.  Clearly, the ISO or IS cannot coordinate well.

3) The shutter lag - if you are taking shots between short intervals with flash, the waiting time may be significant if you are in a rush.

4) Weak flash - I simply cannot get a clear photo at night for a subject standing 10m away.  4m is reasonably ok.  On the other hand, apply contrary thinking for battery life conversation

5) ISO 1600 - it is pushing to the limit and the noise level is too great to seriously put the photo into archive.  ISO 800 is bad enough while 400 is ok.

6) Sensitive Mic - at night, the mic works perfectly but if there is 0.5m tailwind behind, you will hear hurricane during playback.  Of course, I am asking for the moon.

7) 32MB - this is the joke for the day but without a memory card, you cannot even store 1 single shot.

8) Short battery life - common problem faced by other DSCs.

9) Face recognition - the menu describes chasing the faces by pressing the print button while depressing the button halfway.  Hey, our fingers are flexible but they are not yoga trained (yet).

  On the features, I am impressed (besides the obvious DIS, slim and 8MB stories) with:

1) Stitch assist - this is wonderful but i have yet to try out piecing them back via software provided

2) Color switch - wonderful to highlight specific subject

3) Viewfinder - Yes, many are omitting this feature to cut cost. But this is the only way to make your battery lasts 2 times longer (in the event you forgot to take extra battery).

4) Video - Try it.  This is one great reason to buy such ultra compact camera for carrying around.  The video playback is excellent.

5) Reasonably priced - I bought at $213 but now it is $208.  Are you waiting for $199?

6) Great for ladies....

  On accessories, I strongly recommend the following:

1) Leather casing to protect knocking and scratches;
2) 4GB of memory (format using camera);
3) protective cover for the LCD; and
4) Photo bank with 80GB for video taking.

<Content>This camera is a fantastic buy. Small, convenient, reasonable settings. Its about everything you could want in a point-and-shoot digital camera that can fit in your pocket.

HOWEVER, a certain percentage of these cameras experence a fatal lens error which basically means unless you send it back for repair you will never be able to use it again. Canon does not like to admit that this is a common error on their cameras, has not fixed the design flaw, and WILL NOT REPAIR it for free if you are out of warranty. 

I am fortunate that this happened to me while still in warranty (acutally less than two months after purchase) and have sent it back to Canon for repair. It remains to be seen whether they will attempt to charge or blame me for the malfunction. I am very upset about this because I bought this camera specifically so I would be able to take pictures of our trip for our 2nd wedding anniversary, and now I cannot because it will still be in the shop.

To summarize: fantastic camera when it works, totally useless if youre unlucky and get a defective one. Just hope if you do, it shows the defect before your warranty expires or youre out $100-200.</Content>

<Content> If you are looking for a user friendly, easy to carry, point  shoot right out of the box-with the option to learn the more advanced features later, this is the camera for you! It is small enough to carry in your pocket but has enough weight to prove its quality, comes with a wrist strap to prevent dropping it, a memory card, battery with a charger, cables  software to get you hooked up to a computer  a photo printer, and manuals that give clear, precise instructions on how to quick start and then later delve deeper into the capabilities of this exceptional little wonder! Need more info?  Read solid ultra compact camera by Garrett Lowenthal. No one could have covered it better-his review was by far the most helpful. I love it-dont know how I ever did without it! 
*****Update: 9/15/08...Been using this camera long enough now to give more details! Extremely long battery life! But you may want to keep a backup charged for longer photo shoots. Depending on the size of your memory card, you can record like a camcorder! It will keep recording until the memory card is full! Ive read that a 4gb memory card will hold two solid hours of video(?). Again, keep a spare handy because you will get carried away shooting everything everywhere! Printing pictures is super easy! If you dont have a photo printer or a computer with a quality printer, take it to any of the local Wal-marts, Walgreens, etc.. Pull the mem card from the camera, insert into the kiosk, make your choices. Burn your pics to a disk (save them) so you can reuse that mem card, if you like. Its that easy! Print out immediately or submit a three day order for .15 cent prints! These services also allow you to alter your photos before printing (borders, cropping, size, zoom in and eliminate extraneous background clutter-result is georgeous thanks to 8 megapixels, color or redeye correction that didnt happen during shooting-rare but it can happen, etc.). Point, shoot, keep or trash it and shoot again! Or, fill up your card and sort out the good ones later! It is so easy! Im going to buy another one for my son! FYI: Consumer Reports, October 2008 (pg 33) rates the Canon Powershot SD 1100IS in the top three best subcompact cameras!   Will keep updating! Happy shopping! </Content>

<Content>I did extensive research prior to selecting the PowerShot SD1100IS.  My other  choices were the new Nikon Coolpix and the Canon 850.  My prior camera was a Pentax Optio S.  While I own a Nikon SD80 it is large and less likely to be used than the smaller Canon.  I wanted a viewfinder and optical image stabilization with face recognition.  The new Canon has both.  My complaints center around the grainy image on the display prior to taking a picture and the inability to quickly deactivate the flash for taking photos of a distant subject (like a graduation).  Otherwise, the Canon packs a lot of features into a small package at a very reasonable price.</Content>

<Content>I bought the Canon SD1100 primarily to shoot images for online auctions and craft store listings. This meant small glass images shot at close range, indoors using natural light. Ive been delighted with the Digital Macro setting, which rendered these hard-to-shoot images in very good quality (see samples in the Image Gallery). The image quality is clearer and crisper than those Ive seen in other sellers listings on those sites. I also dont have a steady hand: the image stabilization worked like a charm.

It took me a bit to wade through all the icons and instructions in the manual, but I was shooting images I was very pleased with by the second day of use. As others have noted, the memory card Canon includes only holds a few shots -- Id recommend buying a higher capacity card the same time as the camera. But other than that Im very happy with the camera -- my first digital. </Content>

<Content>I bought this as a replacement camera for my wife, and so far, both of us would agree that it was well worth it.  The camera is very easy to operate, produces stunning pictures for such a small camera, and is just plain fun to use.  It has several modes to work with, but we mainly stick with just shooting images.  We currently use a 1 gig card to store the pictures, and so far that has been more than adequate.  For those that shoot a lot of photos before emptying the card may want to get a bigger one though.  For casual home use though, the 1 gig has been more than adequate.  The only nitpick I have regarding the memory card is that putting it back in takes a little extra effort for someone like myself who has big fingers.  Its a very minor thing and should not be a discriminating factor as the camera overall is superb.  Canon tends to produce some very nice small cameras, and this one is no exception.  So far my wife really likes it and has been using it quite a bit to shoot general images she probably would have passed on with her previous camera.  Like all gadgets, read the directions first as that will make it easier using it.  Overall, were both very impressed with it and would highly recommend it to anyone needing a small and dependable camera that takes outstanding images.  </Content>

<Content>First of all, Amazon delivered this product very efficiently regarding its standard Supersavers shipping. Regarding the product, it is almost perfect for an 8mp camera, however, the red-eye reduction feature does not work to my expectations. Besides that, the image stabilization is great, the shooting modes are exceptional (best to offer in the industry) and the choice of colors (I picked bohemian brown because the playback on the LCD with pics and vids show up the better than with any other color) are very nice. Overall, you are getting a lot of nice features with a very compact camera that is easy to carry in your pocket or purse. If you are like me (very particular with what you buy), save yourself the time of shopping and get this camera. It is without a doubt the best bang for your buck when it comes to competitively priced point and shoot cameras that offer a ton of features. </Content>

<Content>I was torn between buying this Canon powershot SD1100IS or a Nikon Coolpix S550.  After looking at reviews on several sites I went with the Canon because it had really good reviews and the Nikon did not.

I got home with the Canon and knew the first 5 minutes that I HATED it!  I couldnt get a decent picture.  Everything looked grainy or blurry and my childrens skin tone kept coming up extremely orange and unnatural.  I was pretty upset.  But I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, I read the owners manual and played around with the setting for about an hour and a half.  After all that 99% of the pictures I took were still awful!  And the other 1% were just so so.  

I was EXTREMELY disappointed by this camera.  You shouldnt have to try so hard to get even one somewhat decent picture.  I took the camera back after 2 hours and got a refund and bought the Nikon I had wanted.  The Nikon takes 1000xs better pictures and I wish Id just gone with it in the first place!</Content>

<Content>This is a perfect pocket point-and-shoot. I bought it with a couple things in mind: 1)high quality photos 2)low price point. I wanted an inexpensive camera, but not a cheap camera - something that I can carry with me every day for a year and not feel like too much of a loss if it breaks. This camera filled all my wishes. It exceeded my expectations by taking crisp, clear video.

Canon makes a quality product, and over-delivers on features. Ive been having so much fun exploring my camera and discovering all the neat extras thrown in.

The stitch assistant is capable of creating beautiful panoramas. Digital Macro is great for getting WAY up close and gets detailed shots. The time-lapse movie mode is loads of fun.

Ill eventually pony up and buy a nice DSLR, but for now, this definitely meets the need of a budding photographer or anyone who wants to capture family events and whatnot.</Content>

I do notice his night shots arent so great with the flash, but thats probably just because we dont know how to do something and arent about to take the time to read the instructions - actually, he threw them away the night he opened the gift, so.....:-)</Content>

<Content>I own an earlier rendition of the Digital Rebel, and as most SLR users know, sometimes you just dont want to lug all that gear around. I live in NYC, and I wanted a compact camera to keep in my messenger bag for any random photo opportunities that came up throughout the day (and didnt want to drop the cash for a G9). The SD1100 really exceeded my expectations. In fact, I took it along with my Rebel on a Caribbean vacation, and I found myself shooting with the compact almost exclusively (and I was shocked at how well it dealt with the strong lighting you run into on the beach.)

It suffers the typical compact limitations (lots of noise at high ISO, tendency to blow out highlights in high-contrast shots, underpowered flash, etc.), but the SD1100 still performs WAY better in all of those categories than any small camera Ive ever used. Even though its a completely automatic affair, the various settings provide enough control to shoot in a pretty much any condition, and theyre accessible enough to adjust on the fly. I love my SD1100 and absolutely recommend buying one -- it provides lots of flexibility and produces pleasing photos at an excellent value. </Content>

This camera does what it promises...takes great photos with little to no experience needed in the user. The image stabilization, LCD, picture modes, and the fact that it does have a viewfinder make this little camera a virtual powerhouse. The size is perfect for back pockets and the color choices are icing on the cake! </Content>

<Content>I got this because I was a klutz with my old Cannon SD400 and dropped it one day.  I think that this camera is great for getting action photos.  It is much more stable and prevents blurred images from occuring unlike my old SD400 which couldnt handle action photos.  The only thing I can say that I didnt expect was the plastic side frame with the colored metal face and back panel.  My original cannon was an all metal frame.  I expected the same thing.  I dont know if the camera will hold up with the plastic frame-but then again it took me 4 years to drop the SD400.

<Content>I wanted a pocket-sized camera that could be a constant companion and instantly available, compared to my Canon G3 which has to hang around my neck or be carried in a bag.  I spent hours comparing cameras and reviewing user comments, then bought the SD 1100IS and headed off for a two week vacation in Alaska.

I am amazed what this little camera can do, often more easily than the G3. At the midnight baseball game without lights in Fairbanks on the longest day of the year I took hand-held telephoto shots filling the screen with the scoreboard, complicated field lighting, and then hand-held closeups of the face of my watch with sharp focus. It is my first experience with stabilizing feature and now would not want to do without it.  </Content>

<Content>First off, let me say that I am the worse photographer. I am terrible with a camera. However, I needed something during my travels in Europe and, after careful review of the other point-and-click cameras, decided to go with this one. I am very happy with it! There are lots of cool features about this camera, like the video recording and digital image switch to micro photos (for flora shots). The color of the images are close to accurate and the camera does help in stabilizing pictures that are awkward to take, like the ceilings of a cathedral. Its very light weight and compact, which were two features that were important to me. All in all, a good little camera. I would recommend this item to a friend.</Content>

<Content>This camera is amazing!  Its economical, takes gorgeous photos even while moving in a car, has great zoom capability and macro ability, and the movie quality will knock your socks off.  Ignore those who nitpic in their evaluations.  Unless youre an 800 lb. gorilla whos hard on your toys, this camera is solid.  You dont need to worry about a thing.  This camera is literally a dream come true.  Order a 2GB memory card, and a couple extra Canon NB-4L Equivalent Digital Camera Battery @ [...] each and you are good to go.  I just returned from vacation with 503 photos that are incredible.  Just remember, rarely use flash indoors.  My indoor photos of the cavernous Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art are amazing with no flash, as are detailed photos of the art.  Some outdoor photos that didnt look like they would be good on the display turned out wonderful once I saw them on my pc.  I even took terrific photos of storm clouds at night.  This camera will make even a novice confident  adventurous.  I recommend Beach Cameras as the source provider.  The transition from my old PowerShot S230 was a cinch.  I met once with an experienced user who helped show me a few tricks.  Now that Ive got those down Ill meet with her again to learn additional tricks.  Its all in the user manuel, I just prefer show  tell.  Once you have it, you wont leave home without it.</Content>

<Content>Before buying this camera, I researched all of the Canon Powershot (ultra compact) cameras on Canons website, as well as, reading blogs and reviews elsewhere online.  This camera is fantastic for someone who wants to take a great picture ALL of the time with the image stabilization (IS) feature.  I would NOT buy any camera without the IS feature.  I bought this camera because IT HAS MOVIE WITH SOUND (SOUND IS KEY) as many other models do not have sound. I also wanted a view window (viewfinder) in case the sun was too bright in Arizona to see the images on the nice 2.5 LCD screen.  I havent had to use the view finder yet. :-)  Now this camera isnt for zooming and taking far off shots in nature as the zoom isnt nearly strong enough for that. Things look smaller on the screen (mountains) than to the naked eye.  But if you want a great camera for taking pictures of people, pets and with the macro setting (up close such as jewelry to list on ebay) this camera will be your new best friend.  It is easy to work and the instructions are actually easy to understand.  I am so thrilled with it. THE PICTURES ARE FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!  And, with amazon, you have no sales tax ... so you will be hard pressed to find a better deal.  And, you can choose the various colors vs. just having another silver camera like everyone else.  I chose the Brown and love it.  God Bless!</Content>

Software installation went off without a hitch and camera transfers pics over in an instant.  Display is nice and bright.  Battery seems to keep the camera running for forever.  Still has viewfinder thats being dropped off of a lot of other cameras. I bought the gray case for the SD1000 that Amazon sells and it fits the SD1100 perfectly.  A little snug at first and then stretches out. Really need the case to protect the camera if you throw it in a pack with cellphones etc.  Bought 2GD memory card and it seems to hold a whole day the way I shoot but if I had it to do over Id probably get 4GB.  All in all this camera surpassed my expectations.</Content>

That said, I find the SD1100IS just excellent.  Get a decent neck strap so you can slip the 1100 into your T-shirt pocket (guys here) and you are all set.  The little camera is very adaptable--recent night shots of Philadelphia came out nicely.  The macro setting works well too--flower details can be recorded with ease.</Content>

<Content>Ive owned digital SLRs for many years and I needed a PS camera to take along for snapshot photos. This camera turned out to be the perfect choice for me. It is so small it can easily be carried anywhere. The photos are not as good as those from my SLRs, of course, but they are excellent, nonetheless. The point is, I can take this camera anywhere for any occasion and get the shot, whereas I cant and wont do that with the pro equipment. 

There are several features I especially like, including manual controls, widescreen mode, time-lapse movie mode, macro mode and a remarkably useable digital zoom. The camera has enough manual controls to satisfy my need for tweaking, especially since I usually prefer the lowest ISO possible with flash forced off.  When I shoot in widescreen mode, I can view the photos on my 16x9 widescreen TV and they look great. As a matter of fact, Im shooting in 16x9 widescreen format pretty much all the time now because of this capability. Digital zoom has changed--no longer do you get blocky images from the cameras blowing up a portion of the sensors image. Due to the sensors high megapixel count, the blown up portion no longer looks pixelated as in previous models. Its like having a telephoto lens inside the camera to get those shots at the rare times when its needed. Macro mode performs so well that flower photos rival those from my SLRs. The camera also has an excellent movie mode, including a fun time-lapse feature.

Previous Canon sensors on PS cameras were use at your own risk when shooting above ISO 100. This cameras sensor has improved considerably by providing what I would call very good photos at ISO 200, good photos at ISO 400 and acceptable shots at ISO 800. I use noise-reduction software to clean up photos, anyway, but Im pleased that Canon has improved their sensor and in-camera software.

Couple all of these features with IS, which virtually eliminates shaking and blurry pictures, and Canon has another winner on its hands. I predict sales of this little gem will be off the charts.</Content>

<Content>I decided to get the SD 1100, rather than the 1000 or 750 my friends have, and Im glad I did. The image stabilization works well, and having the extra megapixels means my shots consistently look just a bit better than theirs. Further, the thing is so remarkably small that it comes with me almost everywhere. It boots up quickly, too, making it easier to get shots of animals or moving people. 
I didnt install the included software, so I cant comment on that, but I do appreciate that pictures import into Picasa just fine without it. </Content>

<Content>Bought this camera to replace my bulky PowerShot S3.  This camera is small, so much so that it can perfectly fit in your pocket.  Its about the same size as a cell phone.  The face detection on this camera is amazing, it will track faces (even if they are moving) and focus right on them.  There are a few settings that can be played with in the manual mode, but not many.  This is to be expected though being it is a point and shoot.  I love the navigational pad, it is flush to the rest of the camera, but it is big enough so you dont mistake the keys (even if you are not looking).  The battery life on the camera is great, usually get around 240 pictures, but that can be extended by tweaking the power save settings in the menu.  There is only one function I wish they would have added to the camera, and that is stitch shooting.  The style of the camera is great, the chrome ring around the lens looks awesome, but will get finger prints all over it realllly quick. 

Over all this camera is amazing, just wish there was a stitch feature.

[UPDATE] I found the stitch setting, it is at the bottom of the menu (when you press the menu key). 

After having the camera for a month I still love it, I take it everywhere with me.  The face detection is amazing, although I found it has a hard time detecting faces in low lighting, which is to be expected.  The image stabalization is outstanding in HI ISO where you cant use a flash.  I havent noticed too much grainy-ness when shooting in HI ISO, maybe when you maximize the picture.... but who does that??? 

I bought a backup battery just in case, I wasted 30 bucks... dont bother, the battery on this thing is amazing!!  Ive charged it once in the last month, and I use it almost 5 time a week.</Content>

The quality is really outstanding and the cost fair.  I was shocked when I developed my first photos and I was even more shocked when my son showed me all the things I can do with my new camera.  Its very fun to use and easy too!  I get so many compliments on the pink color.  Every time I let someone borrow it, they go and buy one for themselves.  Thats how great it is.  I just bought another one for my son who will attend Berkeley in the fall.  He loves his too!</Content>

<Content>WOW!  My wife and I recently took a trip to Disney World.  We both have DSLR cameras and knew we wouldnt want to take them everywhere with us.  So, based on the previous reviews of this camera, we bought it for our trip.  This little camera does a fantastic job.  I think the only complaint I have is that anything at 800 ISO or higher is very grainy/noisy.  I used an existing 1gb sdcard for it and with the settings at 8mp and Fine, I can take 476 pictures or 21 minutes and 30 seconds of video in 320x240.

My wife and I are both students at NYIP.com (by the way, that course is worth EVERY penny).  I truly believe that the NYIP course along with the superior quality of this camera led to some unbelievable photos.

Image Stabilization works very well.  This is the first camera Ive owned with that feature and none of my Nikon lenses have their version of IS known as VR.  You can easily see it working via the LCD.  I moved the camera on purpose and it still managed to capture the photo in very clear focus with the IS enabled.

My previous point and shoot was an SD110.  And after about 5000+ photos, it finally broke down.  Being as satisfied as we were with that camera, we had no problems going back to Canon for another point and shoot and we havent been let down.

My dad and my boss were both in the market for a point and shoot and after seeing the photos and quality of this camera, my dad has already bought this camera and my boss will be getting one this month.</Content>

<Content>I had received a Kodak digital camera for Christmas and it really drove me crazy how grainy the back ground of the pictures were.  So, I started doing some serious research and I kept coming back to the cannon SD1100.

What a difference I saw as soon as I took the first picture.  So clear - and so easy to use.  It is also a breeze to transfer the pictures to your computer.

I am very happy with this camera as I hope you are also if you decide that this is the one for you.  It is for me and it will be for a very long time.  Besides I love the color.</Content>

<Content>This is my 3rd Canon camera.  I have two small kids.  So saying that I take a lot of pictures is an understatement.  I love taking pictures and this is a great camera.  I searched and reviewed all of the canon cameras very diligently before deciding on this camera.  I wanted a Rebel XTI, but it is a little out of my budget right now.  I wanted a camera that would take good quality pictures (like for my Alaska Cruise coming up in June) as well as take great pics of my kids. Some of the other canon cameras had features different from this one and I had a hard time deciding.  But, this camera was a great choice!  This image stabilization is great.  It has some great functions for kids, like a continuous shot function.  Great for capturing my son hit the ball and run to 1st base.  It has this color filter where everything is black and white, except for my sons blue baseball jersey.  I have had a good time with this camera so far.  Great pictures, neat tools.  The technology just keep getting better. A friend of mine got the same camera about the same time I did.  Her second Canon camera.  She has also had great results.  Great camera!</Content>

<Content>This is my 4th digital camera.  I previously had a Canon with 5MP which was great but too large and not enough resolution.  Next I had a Kodak Photosmart which was smaller and a good camera, except that once banged or dropped, the LCD is kaput and the camera is useless.  $60 to repair on eBay, so I then purchased a Panasonic Lumix.  This was my least favorite camera for taking pictures.  There was no viewfinder and once the sun glare was so strong that I could take no photos because I couldnt see what I was looking at.  Also, the shutter lag was too slow to catch children in a good pose.  Did my research and learned good things about the Canon PowerShot SD1100IS and went for it.  This camera is GREAT!  It has face detection and image stabilization.  With these features, my child photos are terrific.  And their faces are not all whited out as in other cameras.  I am very satisfied and this may be my last camera as I have no complaints at all.</Content>

Canon is where you need to be for cameras of any size (and not just the Digital SLRs). Out of the box (which is how most people will use it) this camera takes excellent pictures and its optical stabilizaiton beats any digital stabilization Ive seen so far.</Content>

<Content>Some people might say (or complain) that this is not a simple point and shoot camera, but if you leave the camera in the auto setting--this camera is as good as they get. Those complainers might want to consider a disposable camera instead. This is not as complicated as using those $1k+ cameras. The manual setting allows you to different things like stitching multiple pictures if youre trying to take a wide scenic pictures, auto focus, video, etc. I really didnt know what to expect from this camera. I also own the Canon 30D but wanted something a little more portable. I had owned others but always had problems with my images (or my hands) moving too much. The image stability feature on this camera works perfect. When you point this camera at a person/object--one or more boxes come up on the screen to show you what the camera will focus on. This is very useful if you want to focus on objects that are either close to you or farther away. The boxes actually move if the object is moving so you can get a clear picture of them. I which I $1400 camera had this feature. I read the manual while on my flight to Rome and couldnt believe the feature this thing has. I made sure I had a couple of high capacity memory cards for this trip. Dont bother trying to take pictures in dark places using the flash. The pictures will come out dark. This is a common problem a lot of cameras unless you have enough flash power. When I used the video features of this camera, I was able to take some spectacular video inside several churches (dark inside)in Rome. The videos are stored on the memory card in .avi format. I actually downloaded these videos on my computer and pulled out individual frames. I bought an extra battery for the trip but never used it. This thing doesnt use a lot of battery power. I went a min of 2 days (350+ pictures) without charging it. Even then--I really didnt have to charge it. The menus are easy to understand and the camera allows you to adjust the video/audio quality so you can take additional pictures/video. I used Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 to put all my pictures on a DVD with music and narration and played it on a 32-inch TV. The results were better than I expected. Im going to try and upload a couple of pictures from my Rome, Naples and Capri trip on Amazon. I uploaded the pictures on amazon and can tell you that the results dont do this camera any justice. You can email me--Ill send a couple of video samples that I took when I was in Rome. Please take the time to read the manual and take some sample pictures. I would not manually change the auto settings unless you are familiar with digital photography and how those changes affect your pictures. The auto mode worked very well for me. </Content>

<Content>I had an SD 730 before this one and then it was dropped in the pool. So I started with a Casio Exilim, which totally sucks! Worst camera I have ever used. The SD 1100 is cute small and BLUE which is awesome. I love it, definitely nice to have a Canon back in my hands. Amazon does give a great price for this camera, but once I received it I noticed that it was defective. Two pixels on the LCD screen did not work. I ended up just going to a local wal-mart and paying $45 more because I am scared that if I get another from Amazon, I may have to send it back and forth paying shipping the whole time. 

Conclusion: Great camera but I would pay extra in order to get it from a local store.</Content>

<Content>Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Pink) Purchased this camera for my wife. It is her first digital camera. I set it on automatic and she takes great pictures. It is small enough to be carried in her purse with an extra battery. I put in a 2GB SD card so there is plenty of storage. Always having in with her has encouraged her to regularly use it. 

When I dont take my larger camera, it becomes our primary camera. It has enough manual setting to fit most situations and the IS is a great feature. 

I definitely recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for a small
camera that is easy to use and takes great pictures.

<Content>This is a great camera. I have had it about a month. This is my 2nd digital camera, and its hard for me to believe how far technology has come since my 1st camera 4 years ago.  This camera has everything that you need in a point and shoot.  The pictures are clear and color perfect.  I have taken close to 500 pictures already...I bought a 2GB SD Card to go with it.  The SD Card that comes in the box will hold about 30 pics and a few seconds of video, but I would definately recommend more memory if you have kids.
The video/audio is amazingly clear.  I didnt buy the camera for the video capabilities, but I think that its a feature that I will be using a lot of since my oldest loves posting to youtube!  
I would definately recommend this camera!!!</Content>

<Content>Just bought the SD1100IS to replace a 1-1/2 year old Casio Exilim EX-Z850 that I broke. I checked out all of the reviews for this new Canon model and was impressed with the comments. But after receiving the camera and using it for a few weeks I am beginning to have my doubts. In fact, right now I would happily give it back to have my Casio Exilim back!

1. Slow, slow, slow - the setup time for every shot, particularly indoor shots, is really annoying. My Casio was ready in about half the time.

2. Grainy images on screen for any nightime indoor shots.

3. Severely under-powered flash - I thought I read some reviews that gave it an OK rating at 10 feet...try about 8 feet and you might be more accurate. Many flash shots were severely darkened by lack of light...and often the flash only covered a portion of the image leaving faces dark and everything else in the photo bright.

4. Used it last weekend for a wedding - roughly half of the shots had to be thrown away...you dont get a lot of opportunities at a wedding. Things move along at their own pace. So walking down the aisle, every other shot was blurry, or out of focus. 

5. Face Recognition software worked sometimes, and other times drove me crazy as it would not lock in anywhere near the faces....I eventually shut it off.

6. The pictures - well yes it does take nice pictures...if youre willing to put up with a very annoying camera. Maybe Ill get more used to it over time. I just cant afford to have so many bad shots among the good ones.

<Content>I have been a loyal Fujifilm camera owner for as long as I can remember. I have always loved their cameras and the ease of use. When searching for a new camera this spring, my friend insisted I branch out to a new brand. As difficult as it was (I hate change!) I purchased this camera. I LOVE IT!!! For the same price range, this camera trumps the other camera I was looking at. Tons more features! At first these features intimidated me, but Canon makes it easy! The menus use lots of pictures and simple words. So the photographer dummy I am doesnt get confused. I want to point...and shoot...then print. I am not taking fancy pictures or looking to make poster prints. I have 4 kids, and just want to capture the moments. This camera is great! But even if you ARE an expert, this camera has enough features to keep you satisfied. 

The BEST feature is how QUICKLY it turns out! Almost instant! Within a blink of an eye the camera is on and ready to take pics. Just as quick between pics too!! My old camera must have had a 5 second delay at least!

And the zoom!!! The zoom is amazing! Crystal Clear pictures at full zoom...no joke!!! My old camera got grainy once I hit the digital zoom level. It looks blurry on screen, but once you load it to your computer you see that its crystal clear sharp and crisp! As if you were right next to the object. I couldnt believe it!! 

The camera is very small too! Fits in my back jeans pocket so i can carry it everywhere! Its less bulky than my cell phone! Weighs about the same as my cell phone too, even with the battery in. 

Great camera! I am glad my friend talked me into this one! Amazon offered the best price around (By $30!) so I got a great deal. I am very pleased!

The next test is to see if it will stand the test of time. My FujiFilm cameras all lasted a long time and took a beating! (One still works and is now my daughters camera) I hope Canon is just as sturdy. Like I said, with 4 kids... things get dropped! :(  

Highly recommended camera! No surprise why Canons are rated the #1 consumer camera around!</Content>

<Content>There are three annoying problems that I can see so far, otherwise the camera seems nice. The first problem is that in auto, the camera tends to overexpose so that whites are badly lacking detail. The second is that the background audio in movie mode is loud, so that if youre taking a silent movie, even a very mild wind sounds like your movie was taken during a hurricane. The third is that the recovery time is a bit slow so that the time lag before you can zoom the lens or take the next picture is noticeable. There may be a way to compensate for these faults, but I havent found them yet. On the other hand, the size is nice, build quality seems nice, pictures are generally excellent in both sharpness and color.</Content>

Even though almost a year older than the 1100, the 8500 offers a few attractive features: 1. a 4X optical zoom lens, with an impressive range of 35mm-140mm (the 1100s is 38mm-114mm); 2. marginally faster shutter operation and less lag time between shots; 3. the ISO settings are reassuringly located in a familiar place (under func menu rather than controller) for users who prefer to make the setting manually. 

The experts reviews admittedly favor the 8500, though Im convinced present consumers are overlooking two things: first, the raves were written early last year and cannot be compared to reviews for a newly-made camera with merely incremental improvements (as the model number suggests, the SD1100 is the successor to the SD1000, which was the direct and immediate successor to the extremely popular SD600); 2nd, the marginally slower shutter time of the 1100 (lag between depressing the trigger and getting a response) is the trade-off for the addition of a new feature, Motion Detection technology, which acts in harmony with automatic image stabilization to recalibrate camera settings when extra motion in front of the lens is sensed.  Finally, the apparent unpopularity of this camera is misleading since it comes in five colors and Amazon is treating each separately in its sales rankings (go with pink and save a couple of bucks).

I went with the 1100 (in silver) for several reasons: 1. Its closer in size, weight and appearance to the ultra-compact, classic SD1000 than the rounder and slightly heavier 8500 (for the record, the 1100 reintroduces the softer edges of the 1000s predecessor, the SD600); 2. the new Motion Detection system compensates for any additional lag time, providing sharp shots of kids and pets; 3. it offers an improved screen-- PureColor II (a noticeable improvement over PureColor under both extremely dim and bright conditions); 4. the focal length is ideal for the people shooting;  5. at 4.41oz its an ounce lighter than the other new Canon releases, the SD790 and SD890 (each 5.47oz).

 In short, this is the ideal lazy persons companion, one that makes a nice complement to the good life.</Content>

<Content>I give all the credit to my wife for finding this camera.  I needed a new camera and she came to my rescue!  All I wanted was something easy to use and compact.  Well, to my surprise I got the PowerShot SD1100IS and it is great!  More pixels than I need, yet a perfect size for travel.  My boss has the SD1000 and he loves his camera...but definitely took interest in mine.  I have a 4GB card, very necessary for a frequent snapshot like myself.  All in all, the size was right and the pictures are great.  Perfect for a high-time traveler like myself.</Content>

<Content>I always look to CANON, when it comes to an imaging device.  I own several Canon cameras, (still and video), (2) printers and (2) scanners. The CANON SD1100IS does everything it claims with the same quality as the more expensive cameras do.  With the arrival of my 2 grandchildren, I wanted a camera that captured Clean, Sharply focused pictures quickly, since babies wont pose for you.  So far, since I purchased this at the end of March, I have taken over 300 photos.  At present, I have only charged the battery once and it is still ready to shoot.  The on-board effects add an incredible touch of professionalism to my pictures.  Sunlight, indoors, at night, ambient lighting without a flash, every picture a keeper!  If you are looking for versatility, simplicity, and great pictures you will be proud of, consider the SD1100IS.  I researched a lot of cameras, and the SD1100IS did all I wanted and more, for a very affordable price. </Content>

<Content>The image stabilization and the face detection work well, and most images come out wonderfully. There is a noticeable issue with noise and fast moving subjects are still an issue for me. One is common in ultra compacts and one may simply require another round with the manual so take that for what its worth.

I found the menu and settings to be usable, but the settings I want are sometimes buried on a third level. Sometimes menu response  has lagged a bit, which can be frustrating when your subject is moving faster than you are.

I moved from a Canon SD20 so having an optical zoom is wonderful. Plus, this camera is not that much larger than the SD20 so I still feel like I will take it out with me without worrying about bulk. 

Battery life seems fine so far...much better than the SD which only holds a few minutes charge these days, despite having replaced the battery.

The SD1100 seems to do a decent job overall and overcomes the photographic failures of its operator (what do I know). If you want a simple point and shoot, you could do much worse. If you want more manual control over your pics, really good low light performance or something to document your next roller derby match, this may not be ideal.</Content>

<Content>With all of the glowing reviews for this camera, I expected more from it.  It is a great looking camera, and the menus are easily accessible.  What surprised me was how bad the picture looks in the view finder.  In indoor conditions, the viewfinder shows a fuzzy, grainy picture.  I thought the camera must be defective and got a second one, but it is the same.  The actual pictures look clear, but I am very annoyed with the viewfinder.  I havent used the camera for that long, but it seems that I have to do a lot of red-eye editing later (even with the red eye reduction turned on).   My last camera, the Canon S30, did a much better job in eliminating red-eye from all but the lightest eyed people.  There is a continuous shooting mode, which allows you to set a 1 or 2 second delay before the camera takes another picture.  I found that even with the shortest delay (1 second) that the camera took too long to take another shot (again, indoor conditions with flash).  Its fine for a compact and cute camera, but I really expected more.</Content>

I was able to get the pictures off the camera, and they look ok, but they lack sharpness. Im not sure if this is related to the lens mechanism problem, but I kinda doubt it. Amazon is sending a replacement, unfortunately not in time for my Europe trip. Ill be evaluating the replacement and post a new or updated review.

<Content>I bought the Cannon SD1100 IS about a month ago and I am happy with my purchase so far. I am not even going to pretend to be a camera aficionado but I am a casual photographer that enjoys simple, easy to use cameras that take great pictures. The SD1100 is everything that I was looking for in a compact digital camera. 

Compared to my previous digital camera (a Kodak CX7530), the Cannon is far superior. The images are crystal clear and the included software is much more intuitive and easy to use compared to Kodaks Easy Share software. The included IS feature is nice if you have shaky hands when trying to take pictures. I also invested in a second battery which has come in handy on vacation when its not always easy to find time to charge a single battery. 

I only have a few minor complaints about the camera so far. First, the 32MB memory card included is a joke. No store even sells memory cards this small any more so investing in at least a 1GB card is a must. Secondly, the camera does have rather flimsy plastic doors for the battery/memory card and the AV outputs. The cover for the AV outputs is also a little awkward as it doesnt open fully. The only other thing I noticed about the camera was the LCD screen sometimes displays a solid vertical line or two when taking pictures at night. I noticed this when I was at a night baseball game so I dont know if there is a different setting that I should have used to negate some of the brightness of the stadium lights. </Content>

<Content>I bought the camera just 3 days before leaving for Spain.  The directions were adequate and the camera is really easy to use.  I not only shot photos on automatic but used the night and color options, as well as did a few movies.  The software was essential because I prefer more contrast to my photos and the software allowed me to customize the images as I liked.  

It was not clear to me on Amazon that the camera came with a recharger (it did) so I purchased a recharger.  Turned out that was smart because it came with a European electrical outlet adapter that I used in Spain.  I also purchased a 4G memory card.  I took 535 photos and 5 movies, and there seems to be more room.  

For its size (I carried the camera in my front pants pocket) it takes amazing pictures.  I definitely recommend the camera.</Content>

<Content>This camera is a great companion to my Rebel XT, but I am getting to the point where I may abandon the SLR for certain trips, due to the crisp image quality and greater portability of this model.

The PowerShot IS excels in good light, with its ISO 80 setting providing great colours. 
At the opposite end, ISO 1600 is a useful setting to have, however the images become quite grainy, and if your subject is moving, you are unlikely to get a crisp snapshot in low light.

The large LCD screen makes composition easy, and the quick power up and power down makes for opportunistic shooting.

I am also a big fan of the timelapse feature, whereby you can take videos at 1 or 2s intervals and the output is stored as an AVI file at 15fps. 

One adjustment I will have to make is with regards the battery life, and after using a digital SLR which can go days without a charge, Ive found I need to keep a spare battery on me to keep the energy hungry LCD screen in business.

A few of the features are a bit gimmicky, such as the colour swapper, but for the price, the 8MP images pack as professional a punch as you could want from a sub $250 camera.</Content>

<Content>Got the PS SD1100IS to replace an older Canon digital. This is a big improvement since the other was about 3 years old, and tho it took great shots it was bulky and sometimes had a maddening delay when trying to shoot portraits. This new camera is much more compact, takes great pictures that download faster and is a joy to use. DIS was important to me and I am still testing this; but so far it seems to be an improvement over the older stabilization technology. I got about 200 shots before needing to recharge, and charging time is quick. It will still delay a little when shooting under low light conditions, but that is the nature of digital photography. And it has less flexible capabilities for manually making your own settings; but overall I am very pleased to have this sophisticated little camera that can go anywhere. It is smaller so you have to pay attention where you leave it! You will need to get a decent bag for it that straps to your belt or goes over your neck. Also will need a larger memory card. The ordering process went very smoothly and there were no surprises.</Content>

But it still wont take night shots on the night setting, which after going on 2 ghost tours with the other 2 and my 12 year old canon 35 mm nothing shows up. I always had problems with night shots, batteries, and shutter speed. 

The reputation and charging ability was the main reason I picked this.  The choice of colors were nice, I wanted blue or gold but only Best buy and Wolf carried old boring silver or pink so I ordered from J  R online. Dont look for it at Walmart, Sears, Target, they dont have it yet.

<Content>Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Brown)


I own and am a huge fan of the Canon Digital Rebel SLR and think that it takes great pictures.  Unfortunately, there are times when a larger camera with all of its accessories and lenses can be prohibitive.  In preparation for an upcomming event where I would be a participant as well as spectator, I realized that I would be unable to carry around my Rebel.  

So, I spent several days reading different reviews before deciding on the Canon PowerShot SD 1100.  I must stress that the fact that I already owned a Canon played no part in my decision.  I did not settle on the SD 1100 out of brand loyalty.  I must have read more than 30 or 40 different professional reviews of various cameras before picking this one.

I have only had this camera for a couple of days, and havent yet used it at the event for which it was purchased, but I must say that I am extremely pleased with this camera.  The most common negative comment in reviews of this camera is that it does not offer a wide variety of manual settings.  I have to agree that if you are looking for a camera to launch your career as a professional photographer, this may not be the best choice for you.  

The camera is ultra compact without feeling cheap.  It is well designed, well made, full featured, takes great photos under a variety of conditions and exceeds all of my expectations for a more portable alternative to my full sized SLR.  I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about this camera and I cannot imagine why somebody wouldnt be extremely happy with this purchase.

I also recommend buying the case advertised as an accessory for this model as it has a belt loop that allows you to carry it safely and securely on your belt instead of in your pocket.</Content>

I wish the buttons were easier to interpret and that there were a simple mode to take basic pictures. I have found that the face detection aspect of it does slow down the picture taking. This is especially hard to overcome when trying to take pictures of small chilren who do not hold poses. The quality is excellent though. </Content>

<Content>(NOTE:  Ive had the camera for two days.)

This camera is nothing short of amazing.  First, the size.  It literally fits in your hand!  The size means the camera can slip into a shirt pocket and go ANYWHERE.  I wear an orange safety vest at work and this camera fits neatly into a pocket.  In the two days Ive had this camera, Ive taken almost 150 pictures!  Entirely due to the size of the camera.  It goes everywhere with me now.  

Features?  How did Canon pack so much into such a tiny package?  The controls are intuitive and easy to use.  Most people wont crack the manual until they start taking more advanced shots.  For the rookie (read: me), this camera is a true point-and-shoot.  The optical image stabilization is wonderful and works like a champ.  The 8MP pictures look HUGE.  There are two different zoom modes  on this camera.  A 3x regular zoom plus another 6-7x optical.  

The battery for this camera charged in less than 90mins.   Camera came with a 32MB SD card which goes very fast at 8MP.  Still, the fact that Canon included one at all speaks volumes about the company.  Lots of accessories are available too.  

There are a bunch of more advanced features that I cant speak about.  Different shooting modes, ISO settings, and other neat things.  There is even a movie mode!

Images look great to this untrained eye.  Your mileage will vary.

Highly recommend for people who just want to take lots and lots of pictures!</Content>

<Content>This camera is an upgrade over my trusty SD300, which still works apart from the mode switch getting stuck once in a while. I took literally thousands of pictures with it, and I expect the same functionality and durability with the SD1100IS. This upgrade feels solid and carries over most of the features I enjoyed with the old one, adding image stabilization and--hallelujah--a battery life indicator. And 8 megapixels is enough for a hi-res 300ppi print at 8x10. Best of all, it uses the same battery and SD cards as the old one, with the added capability of the SD HC cards. I have also owned a couple of Olympus (good) and a Panasonic (awful), and I can honestly say Im a Canon man. The SD1100IS is a tremendous value, looks much nicer than the SD1000, and the blue casing is much prettier in person. Excellent quality photos. Highly recommended.</Content>

<Content>First about the SD1100 and later in the review, a comparison between Canon SD series cameras. 

The former Canon PowerShot SD1000 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver) was the perfect tiny camera that you could slip into your shirt pocket and bring out at a moments notice and begin clicking away. No wonder it has been Canons top selling model! It was almost perfect except it did not have image stabilization like some other Canon cameras. And now with the SD1100IS Canon has added its motion detection technology to this tiny camera which will make your shots less blurry, especially in low light.

Other enhancement over SD1000 is a slightly rounded styling which feels more comfortable in the hand and gives you a better grip. You can also choose from fun colors - Bohemian brown anyone?  

I have several Canon cameras and I use them regularly, but once again the  SD1100 gets a lot of use as its easy to carry in your tighter jean pocket/shirt pocket.

What else is nice about the SD1100 IS? 
Basic picture taking:
It takes excellent outdoor shots and has a satisfactory low light performance for its size. The face detection and auto white balance in the frame help expose faces correctly. It has a viewfinder in case the sun is too bright and an anti-reflective 2.5 screen. You can also use your high capacity SD cards in this baby. 

Creative features:
With this camera you can get creative with My Colors features. The Color Accent mode where you keep any one color in the picture while the rest is black and white helped frame a blue sky, blue sea and blue jeans in a b/w group shot. Cool! There are options to swap colors and also take b/w or sepia pics. Read the manual and youll discover even more fun features.

The Scene modes are tried and tested and help you take the best picture. I love foliage which brings out the greens or autumn colors. Fireworks freezes the bursts of firecrackers in the sky in perfect spheres. Aquarium helped me take wonderful shots of fish, before this mode all I got was my flash reflecting on the glass of the tank. The others modes - indoor, beach, snow, kids/pets have been useful too.

Making videos:
The video mode takes movies in 3 different sizes and it has a time lapse video function. You can set the camera to record at intervals. I used it to capture suns ascent from sunrise to mid morning and the video looks fabulous. You can even use the creative colors modes while taking video. The image stabilization helps in the video mode eliminating jerky shots.

The bottom line? This is a great camera - its take-along-everywhere tiny, its got a ton of creative features and takes great pictures, it also comes in fun colors. Its the one to get! 

EXTRA READING FOR THOSE WHO ARE STILL NOT SURE...
If you want the perfect balance between image quality, features, size, layout and last but not the least the price, here is my 2 cents worth. (I own 4 SD cameras and have done some research using all of these for the same picture at the same location.)

Image Quality: Top slot goes to the cameras in the 800/900 series. The image quality of SD1100 is a notch below.

Layout and controls: The controls are better on the 800/900/700 series compared to SD1100 as you have a separate instant replay button which is very useful to switch between shoot and replay mode. I LOVE this feature as it saves me a lot of time while shooting. Its so much better than the rubber slider on this 1100 model. 

Screen size: This camera has a 2.5 screen with a viewfinder while some other models offer 3 inch screen but are missing the viewfinder. I prefer the larger screen as the extra .5 makes composing shots much easier. I have NEVER missed the viewfinder yet, even in bright sunlight. 

Camera Size: SD1100 is the winner here as its the tiniest. The SD750/770/790 are almost as compact but 800s/900s are bigger.

If picture quality is important for you go for the 800/900 series. If smaller size, with nice picture taking capability is important look at the 700 series. If you want the tiniest, convenient camera which takes pretty good shots at a bargain price go for this SD1100.

<Content>I took a lot of time to review this camera before buying. I DID NOT buy the camera at this time, so this is a PREVIEW - not a review.

Why am I writing? Because I see so many people here describing the SD1100 as an upgrade to the SD1000 - with the only differences an added megapixel and image stabilizer - So I would like to bring to your attention the rest of the differences and improvements, which can help your decision.

The SD1100 has many improvements over the SD1000. It has FINALLY a battery meter which is a recent welcome addition in Canon cameras. It has the LP mode for video, which doubles the time you could record video, at almost the same quality (640x480). So in the SD1000 on a 2gb card you were limited to 16 minutes, and in the SD1100 you can have 32 minutes. Thats also a welcome addition for Canon which only lets you record on uncompressed AVI format - not MPG like so many others. You can still not use the OPTICAL ZOOM when recording video.

The zoom range is also different. The SD1000 was a little more wide-angle, and the SD1100 zooms in a bit more.

The face detection technology is also improved, by applying the strength of the flash according to the face it is recognizing, so its should not overexpose.

For you guys who still doesnt have a clue what the SD1000 was bringing new, let me repeat in short (of course everything is included in the SD1100 as well). Face detection technology; in camera red eye correction; 2:3 guide for 4x6 prints (you know where its gonna get cut-off); settings and menus are much better designed than previous canons (you could see more selections on screen); and much more.

I would also like to mention that pcmag.com has a review on the new SD1100, but they say that the older SD1000 (which was a editors choice since arrival) have better picture quality than the newer SD1100 - So that the new 1100 is not worth upgrading from the SD1000.

Hope my information will help someone.</Content>

But, from the other extreme of photographer-smartness, this is a great little camera to use. Its easy, yet has a lot of functionality, which the user guide manages to clearly explain. I needed something very small, which it is, that takes awesome pictures, which it does. Battery life seems very good, so far. My husband likes the manly brown color, too. </Content>

<Content>I have been using a Powershot I2 IS for the last 3 years. Very good camera with a fantastic 12X Zoom.  However, I wanted a camera to carry in my pocket.  So many times I just didnt feel like dragging a large camera with me to various parties or events.  This camera fills the bill. I carry it everywhere.

The pictures it produces are stunning. The 8MP 3X zoom produces a picture that you can crop to the point that you get almost the same picture as you would have with the 5MP 12X zoom lense (my opinion). The movie feature is wonderful too, even better than the I2 IS. 

The camera feels great in your hand with a solid, quality feeling.  If you have used Canon cameras before the menus are very intuitive. I would not have purchased this camera (or any camera for that matter) if it did not have the Image Stabilization feature.  This is especially a must as you get older. 

By the way there is an advantage to the Brown color: If you have to use the optical view finder outside, the camera itself produces minimum glare for you eye to see more clearly through the small opening. The color also makes the LCD playback pop.  And as a bonus, it really gives the camera a luxury look, you have to see it in person to appreciate the color.

I recently took it to a monthly card party and everyone went wild over it. So much so that one person sat right down at the computer and ordered one!  If you want a sub-compact, pocketable camera that takes great pictures, I highly recommend the Canon SD1100IS.

<Content>As a travel writer I spend a lot of time at Walt Disney World, and Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs are the most common cameras I see. Families seem to love them, because theyre so easy to carry and operate. About the size of a deck of playing cards, each of these pocket cameras really do slip right into a pants pocket, and their rectangular designs make them easy to grip. Best of all, they all take good photos. (How do I know? Because Ive actually gotten to use every one of these models. Nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs.)

Heres my breakdown of the ten bestselling Digital Elph models. Any of the first six are superb choices:

1ST PLACE: SD1100 IS (The camera on this page)
An update to the SD1000 (see below), this 2008 8MP beauty adds image stabilization, a slightly longer zoom (38-114 mm), another MP of photo size and a small indent on the right side for a better grip. Plus it comes in colors! My daughter has a blue one and uses it every single day. During school days the image stabilization made a real difference in her on-the-bus shots. With that heavy of use hers has gotten scratched up a bit, but the marks are small and hardly noticeable.

2ND PLACE: SD870 IS
The ELPH to buy if you want a wide-angle lens. Slightly thicker than the SD1100 IS, this 8MP model doesnt have an optical viewfinder which makes it tough to use in bright sunlight, otherwise theres little not to love. My husband uses one as a comp camera, to compose shots for the travel guide The Complete Guide to Walt Disney World.

3RD PLACE: SD770 IS 
Just released in May, this 10 MP model is, in a way, an update of the SD1100 IS (see above). I rate it lower because it has a plastic body and doesnt come in colors. On the other hand, it has a longer battery life than the 1100 and features an improved LCD screen that is very easy to view. As for photo quality, I cant tell the difference.

4TH PLACE: SD950 IS
Theres a lot to like in this 12.1 MP camera. First off, its gorgeous. The body, though a little thick, is titanium. An upgrade to the SD850 IS (see below), it has a 3.7x zoom lens and adds manual controls as well as the ability to stitch together panoramic images. The only reason I dont rate it higher is the price.

5TH PLACE: SD890 IS 
Want a long zoom lens? Heres your baby, a 10 MP model with a 5x zoom. Also has the new bright LCD screen and all the other 2008 Canon goodies. The most expensive Canon PowerShot ELPH.

6TH PLACE: SD790 IS 
With the same 10 MP image sensor and 3x zoom lens as the SD770 IS, this new model stands out only for its larger 3-inch LCD display and, as a result, lack of optical viewfinder. The rear controls are different, too, with a flatter design that uses fewer buttons.

7TH PLACE: SD1000
In my opinion theres no reason to buy this 7.1 MP model. Released in 2007, its been replaced by the SD1100 IS (see above). The SD1000 is a fine camera but it doesnt have image stabilization, a key feature of the 2008 lineup.

8TH PLACE: SD850 IS
The ancestor to the SD890 IS, this 8 MP Elph combines a 4x zoom and 8 MP photo size with an image stabilizer. Every button, dial and switch has a quality feel. Slighter larger than the other models here, it is a little tougher to pop in and out of your pocket, but if you have larger hands it may be just what you are looking for.

9TH PLACE: SD800 IS
This 7.1 MP predecessor to the 870 doesnt focus well at its edges when set at its widest angle. Still, its good training for someone who wants to compose like a pro.

10TH PLACE: SD750
The 2007 PowerShot flagship offers a light meter that adjusts for facial brightness, 17 shooting modes, some first-rate movie features and red-eye correction -- features that were innovative a year ago but are common in Canons 2008 models. No image stabilization; no optical viewfinder.</Content>

If you need a solid, reliable, and stylish point-and-shoot ultracompact digital camera that produces high-quality images, then the new Canon PowerShot SD1100IS may be right for you.

I am an advanced amateur photographer and own 2 Canon digital cameras (G2 and 20D).  Both have served me well over the years but recently I have found myself needing a decent ultracompact camera that I can easily carry with me at all times for unexpected photo-ops.

Other current Canon models that I also researched before my purchase of the bohemian brown SD1100IS included the SD950IS and the SD1000. 

Here is my take on the SD1100IS:

Strengths:
- 8MP CCD sensor with DigicIII processor (excellent resolution images with good dynamic range)
- Solid construction (most of body made of anodized aluminum)
- Feels sturdy and well-balanced in the hands
- Easy to use (logical user-interface) with minimal need to consult owners manual for basic operation
- Multiple shooting modes to fit variety of situations (action/sports mode is a glaring omission but read section below to see possibly why)
- Advanced metering system with accurately exposed pics in even tricky situations (great balance of highlights and shadows)
- Tack-sharp images (much more so with sufficient lighting and use of built-in flash)
- Macro mode can result in stunning close-ups with outstanding level of detail
- Optical IS feature helpful when shooting in either low-light conditions with flash off or at telephoto lengths
- Fast start-up with acceptable shutter-lag (when not using flash)
- Bright 2.5 LCD monitor (100% coverage, 230k pixels) made of polycrystalline silicon; fairly scratch-resistant (cant vouch if this applies to keys and coins)
- Optical viewfinder (though only a tiny peephole, it is essential when LCD glare and washout become an issue shooting in bright sunlight or when LCD cannot be used as battery power is nearly depleted)
- Camera made in Japan (at least those from the 1st shipment; this easily may be subject to change)

Limitations:
- Lack of manual control over aperture, shutter speed, and focusing (for the obssessive control-freaks)
- Noise is noticeable beginning at ISO 400 (ISO 800 still useable but probably for only 4x6 images; ISO 1600 mostly unuseable)
- Fastest shutter speed is 1/1500 sec (not fast enough to stop action for some sporting activities)
- Auto-focus speed inadequate to follow fast-moving subjects
- Shutter-lag accentuated with flash on (precious Canon moments lost while waiting for flash to recharge)
- Cannot adjust focus or optical zoom while shooting in movie mode (focus is fixed for distance selected at first frame, and digital zoom is permitted instead, resulting in significant image quality deterioration)
- Battery/memory card cover and hinge made of plastic (no safety latch that needs to be de-activated first before sliding cover out, in order to prevent accidental opening)
- Minor vignetting and chromatic aberration (albeit, difficult not to expect from compact ps)
- Pincushion and barrel distortion at the extremes of the focal lengths
- No RAW shooting mode

Battery power in camera mode with LCD monitor on is mostly as advertised, allowing for approximately 240 images.  If your budget permits, I recommend investing in a few spare batteries as backups and replacing the supplied 32MB memory card with a pair of 4GB SDHC memory cards--vital purchases if you plan to use the movie mode frequently.

Overall Impression:
Even with some serious limitations inherent to virtually all digital cameras in this class, I am recommending the Canon PowerShot SD1100IS.  It does what its supposed to do.  This camera allows one to take beautiful photographs in an ultracompact, reliable, and elegant device that is both easy and fun to use.


[UPDATE: Since this review, Canon has recently announced 3 new ELPH models that will be released soon....in time for Grad  Dads Day: the PowerShot SD770IS, SD790IS, and SD890IS.  All are redesigned 10MP digital cameras with Optical Image Stabilizer.  The saga of the MP race continues.  If the same sensor is found in these units as their predecessors and without improving the noise reduction technology, then adding a few more MP can potentially result in noisier images.  Well have to wait and see.  The most intriguing of the bunch appears to be the SD790IS, which replaces the SD750 by adding the very useful Optical IS feature and showcasing flat control buttons.  Hopefully, the QC has been remedied on this unit as many consumers experienced the dreaded lens error nightmare.  The SD890IS replaces the SD850IS and may appeal to vacationers and wildlifers needing more reach at the telephoto end.  The SD770IS seems a bit curious as it may be in direct competition with the new SD1100IS (which is the natural successor to the wildly popular SD1000); it has 2 additional MP but the feature set appears at first glance to be nearly identical to the less expensive SD1100IS.  I wouldve preferred to have seen upgrades to the SD870IS and the SD950IS, but those will be rolled out undoubtedly later this year....conveniently before the Holidays.

SD770IS: 10MP, 3X Optical zoom (35-105mm), 2.5 LCD monitor, Optical viewfinder, ISO 1600, MSRP $299.99.
SD790IS: 10MP, 3X Optical zoom (35-105mm), 3 LCD monitor, no Optical viewfinder, ISO 1600, MSRP $349.99.
SD890IS: 10MP, 5X Optical zoom (37-185mm), 2.5 LCD monitor, Optical viewfinder, ISO 1600, MSRP $399.99.]

<Content>Great point and shoot. I have a digital SLR but wanted something compact that I could carry in my pocket. Took it on a 2 week road trip and put it through the paces (see photos at http://teal_brick.livejournal.com) Found that night shots and action shots came out a bit funky in Auto mode but can compensate with other settings. Took a couple short videos and was really pleased with resolution and the sound even with my finger over the microphone. The zoom lens is amazing for such a small camera. Definitely the best feature. </Content>

<Content>I am truly amazed with this camera. It takes superb pictures no matter where you are and it is definitely the best in its class. I did my research and Panasonic definitely had the best cameras, for having a big lens in such a small structure.

I was a bit worried about size but when I had it with me it easily fit in my pants pocket. I am truly amazed at the size and being able to hold a 10x optical lens at the same time.

The only issue I see with the camera is not having the auto rotate (not sure if that is the name) that when you review pictures it rotates it as you rotate the camera itself. Unless Ive missed a step in the manual I cant find it, but nonetheless Ive lived without it just fine.</Content>

<Content>With my european travel plans made, I knew that Id be doing a lot of walking.  I have had a Panasonic DMC-FZ30 for several years and have been very pleased with its performance.  It takes wonderful pictures and the 12X zoom is great.  The one drawback has been its size, about that of a standard SLR.  I didnt want to have the camera getting in the way on a trip that would be very physical.

With that in mind, I looked back to Panasonic and, after a lot of research, chose the DMC-TZ5.  The reviews were generally very good and I liked the possibility of a mega zoom and Leica lens in a small point and shoot.  The 9MP is more than adequate for my needs.

Once again, I was not disappointed.  The size was perfect to carry in a belt case.  After about 200 pictures, I am very satisfied with its performance.  I sure that someone will make a negative comment about night shots, but I found it to be quite satisfactory.  Afterall, its not a $2,000 digital SLR; its a $225 point and shoot that does an very admirable job of taking quality pictures in all kinds of situations.</Content>

<Content>I got this camera as a step up from my little Canon Powershot and I think that it will do a great job with photos.  The modes appear excellent and the lens is good.  But the video is simply awful.  Why?
1) the clips are Quicktime . . . so if you have a Mac, this might be a plus but with a PC?  Windows Moviemaker doesnt recognize them :-(  I dont look forward to converting them.
2) the sound is terrible, really, really bad.
3) the hi-def aspect drew me in but it truly eats up memory.  Even an 8 GB card will be useless

We leave for the Grand Canyon in less than a week--I dont have time to return this camera.  I guess I will take it along for pictures and use the 3-year-old Canon of video and my sons Flip.  I wasnt looking for awesome video performance (I like to shoot a few supplemental vids) but the Pentax is really substandard.  

A great disappointment.

I think I will take this camera for photos and bring along my little Canon powershot just to do videos. </Content>

<Content>Overall it is a great camera. Found three things that bothered me, but for the price of the camera, I can leave with them no problem.
- Pictures a little bit noisy, even at ISO 100
- Flash position - constantly I get my finger in front of it (getting used to not though)
- Manual white balance doesnt work according to manuals instructions, I cannot set the white (if someone can help me with this, Id appreciate)
I was between setting 4 to 5 stars, but since it delivers excellent pictures, I believe thats what matters in the end of the day.</Content>

The HD video is truly great, but the sound is definitely not loud enough.  All in all, this is a good camera that takes beautiful pictures.  </Content>

<Content>I had always purchased canon cameras and I wanted to try something new.  Overall, i am well pleased with my purchase, but heres a breakdown:

pros:
amazing zoom and widescreen
array of settings, from airplane shots to night scenery
great video quality, mic kinda sucks though

cons:
focus is a bit slower than im used to, not as good as the canons
doesnt take good shots in tungsten lighting, but the flash settings are great.  doesnt wash out peoples faces.
with increased zoom comes increased camera jitter.  im thinking of buying a travel tripod for this reason.

i was at a concert taking pictures, which usually produces an image where you cant recognize the performer.  this camera took shots like i was in the front row - amazing!</Content>

<Content>Ive had this camera since August 08.  Overall I like the look of it (the blue looks fine and cost less than the black) and solid feel.  Its portable enough to be put in my waistpack when I travel.  However, this camera focuses slowly and thus not suitable for taking kids pictures since they tend to be on the move all the time.  Also last week at the school concert, I stood in the back and had to use the 10x zoom.  Well that was the worst experience of using any camera.  I took half a dozen pictures and none came out clearly.  It just couldnt focus.  All the pictures were fuzzy.  I nearly threw the camera away!   Later somebody who owns a Lumix said that was because I used the long range zoom.  With less zoom, the camera would focus better.  But then, why buy 10x zoom?  </Content>

<Content>Prices on this camera have dropped nicely, so I bought it based on the good reviews, with attention to the decent video quality.

The camera has a nice feel, and I do like the menu system. 

Many of our photos came out very grainy and noisy, even at the 9MB size (which I feel is really an unnecessary number). These are usually in lower light or shadowy images, but seem moreso than strikes me as reasonable compared to our other point and shoot camera (a Coolpix).

The video is nice, both at the SD and HD levels. The zoom works smoothly. There is a file size limit of 2GB per video episode, which lasts about 8.25 minutes at HD resolution. Which I did not find out about until I tried to shoot about 9 minutes of video. The audio is awful - muted as if in a tin can, which isnt surprising as the microphone is on top of the camera. Really quite unusable.

So - so photo quality for me in a mix of uses and exposures, terrible audio. Its going back, restocking fee or no.</Content>

<Content>I purchased Panasonic DMC-TZ5A to complement my DSLR. As much as I love my DSLR, its simply not convenient/practical under some circumstances. 

Needless to say, I had high expectations when I bought the Panasonic TZ5A. So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by its capabilities. Its relatively compact, given its range of focal lengths (all the way from a nice 28mm wide angle to an impressive 280mm telephoto). The image quality is very good. The only major complaint I have is the long shutter lag when the flash is on. It becomes especially worse when the red-eye reduction is also enabled.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase (I even tried out a Canon 880IS, and the Pani is on-par with this one for the most part. It outshines the Canon with its telephoto capabilities - the Canon sports only a 4x zoom). I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a superzoom compact camera.

<Content>  Although I had been using and loving a small Canon ELPH camera for several years, I was beginning to feel that the kinds of photos I could take with it were limited. I looked at a lot of other pocket-sized cameras (including the delightful Lumix DFX-37, perfect in almost every way!!!!)before I decided that I would trade tiny-ness for the super 10x optical zoom lens. For me, the great lens has opened up many opportunities. It took a little while to get used to the un-zoomed, wide angle(28mm)view, but I am very pleased with its results! I recommend this camera to anyone who is willing to carry it in a bag or case; if you really need a shirt-pocket camera, get the DFX-37!
 The Lumix DMC-TZ5S doesnt ship with a memory card which is annoying, but otherwise you get everything you need to hit the ground clicking!</Content>

<Content>I purchased my TZ5K just prior to leaving for a 20 day cruise from Japan to Kodiak and disembarking in Vancouver B.C.  I hurriedly read the Users Manual and started taking pictures.  Like most sophisticated digital cameras it has a multitude of features so Im still learning.  The results have been great.  I purchased a 16 GB San Disk Ultra ll memory chip so I would have plenty of memory as I like to take high resolution pics.  I took over 1,000 still pictures and a dozen or so movie clips lasting as long as 2 minutes.  I was surprised to see that I have only used about 5 GB of my memory.  

Of course all of the pics that I shot arent keepers, I left them on the disk so I could see how long my 16 GB chip was lasting.

The primary features I like are of course the 10X optical zoom, 9 mega pixel resolution and the 28mm wide angle capability without changing lenses.  The various settings for sports, photo, pets, children etc. are very handy.  I currently have a Nikon D-50 SLR and the new Lumix TZ5 is much handier to take on hikes eliminating the need to pack a heavy camera bag with extra lenses. </Content>

<Content>Ive read almost all the reviews on this camera and people should really figure out how to use the item they buy a little bit.  For someone whos looking for a the best camera on the market for an affordable price, this is the best (at least when I bought it in June 2008).  Keep in mind everything in the world will have manufacturing issues/mishaps. 

The quick menu helps switch settings very fast.  I rapidly take pictures constantly when Im on the road (I even got an extra battery).  The best part is it has a 6 mode dial for operation, two of which being SCN1 and SCN2 and you select the type of shot from there.  Which speeds up your selection incredibly.  After learning the operations I rarely use the Intelligent Auto mode.  Which was great, I have captured amazing photos.

Go to the website and see for yourself.  Wide angle 28-280mm lens.  
http://www2.panasonic.com/consumer-electronics/shop/Cameras-Camcorders/Digital-Cameras/Lumix-Digital-Cameras/model.DMC-TZ5A_11002_7000000000000005702

Its a Leica in a Panasonic package which is very important.  

You have to buy a high-speed SD memory card or else the fast processor will be pointless.  I paid for the fast (level 3) and theres no lag.

Movie mode has auto-focus and zooming! I couldnt find a better camera that has all these features.  Consider everything in this camera.  The movie making is so good Ive been capturing a lot more movies than I ever anticipated.</Content>

<Content>I have been an amateur photographer for over 20 years. Bought this to replace an aging Canon 400 Elph. Wanted the wide angle and extra zoom as when I shot with a SLR, I used my 28-200 and 28-300 mm lenses most of the time (have 24-100 mm Nikon lenses too). While I can shoot my Nikon D40 with my lenses, I wanted something more compact but had wide angle and 10x zoom. 

This camera is not much bigger than my Elph (which I love for the size)and smaller than I expected. Shot a few images from my office and the controls were easier to quickly understand and use than the Elph. Image quality is sharp and the high res screen makes it easy to see. Wide angle is great as well as the 10x optical zoom.

I used a viewfinder with lines to assist in composition on my Nikon SLR and find this feature in the TZ5. Prefer a viewfinder but most cameras do not have them unless they are DSLR size; small sacrifice as the display is large (3 inches and very bright vs. other cameras like my Elph). 

Going to shoot this tomorrow at the Farmers Market in IA mode to see how it works. Will update this review once I get a chance. 

Great value for the money as Panasonic has released the S3 which is about 50% more expensive. Bought this from Butterfly Photo which has a great exchange policy, customer service and reasonable overnight shipping fees.</Content>

<Content>Although not the most compact camera around thats more than compensated for by its versatility and quality.  I love the ability on a camera of this size to be able to zoom 10x and even at night in low light using maximum zoom I find the image stabilisation works very well.  Unlike some reviewers, I havent found any difficulty in using the screen in any light conditions, even in bright sunlight and wearing my sunglasses.  Even though theres no manual mode, there are enough available functions with the modes available that one can almost always get the shot one wants.  I agree with the advice to have 2 batteries because, if youre like me, youll want to take it everywhere and frequently use it to take chance photographs which you may not have attempted with a camera less well configured than this one.  I also have an 8Gb extreme SDHC card and this allows plenty of opportunities to shoot short video clips (and be able to zoom whilst doing so) and not worry about running out of disc space if you just take photos for deleting later when you sort the wheat from the chaff!  Just in case, I also carry a spare 4Gb card in my camera case.
I bought this to replace a TZ15 Id purchased in Dubai a year ago and which went missing on a recent trip.  I didnt want anything else to replace it and immediately ordered another from Amazon one to be delivered to my destination hotel as soon as possible.
Quite simply the best travel camera Ive ever owned. I love it!</Content>

<Content>The camera takes quality photos, but Im quite disappointed in two areas. First, the flash button is not apparent to users, especially first-time users. A silver icon on silver background was a poor choice of engineering here; people who use our camera always have trouble finding the flash. Its a shame such a simple task is so hard.

Also, there is not a simple way to transfer pictures from the camera to a PC. Oh sure, there is a cord that allows the connection, but it does not appear to be any type of standard USB or mini-USB cable. If you lose it, you cannot just use a standard USB that you probably own for your other devices. A bluetooth option or a standard USB connection would have made this review much more positive.

Overall, the camera is just okay. These two poor choices of implementing basic features are a two-star deduction.</Content>

I recently took a photo at an honor awards ceremony from ~40 feet away in indoor conditions. Combining the zoom, high sensitivity mode, and image stabilization, I got an excellent picture which amazed my relatives! I particularly like having two customizable modes. I have one set up for indoors and the other set up for wide angle scenics and Im ready for vacation travel. To get much better Id have to get an SLR at four times the price, weight, and bulk.</Content>

<Content>Pro: Leica lens, body design (good feel and grip), component quality, zoom capability, Intelligent Auto and ISO, easy manual selection of sorts, LCD screen (wow factor) even in direct sunlight, HD movies, Lumix top digital camera in repair history (Consumer Reports), travel feature, bright screen even in indoors; face recognition, optical image stability--they all work well.

Con: Still trying to figure out the macro-tele-macro., finding a case was not easy, does not come with a component cable for HD viewing, movie viewing works best with QuickTime.

It is virtually impossible to get a bad photo. The hardest job is composing your shot; the camera does the rest. I upgraded from a Canon A75 and like Canon, but this Lumix has made me a believer. I just keep showing off my pictures to my son who owns a Nikon D60. While he disagrees, I think most of my photos so far can stand up to his.

I got this camera about 2 weeks ago and Im preparing to take it on a trip to Turkey next month. The camera was a snap to set up for a trip; nice feature. Ive taken photos and video for over 50 years, and I have to say this is the most fun and satisfaction I have ever had with a camera. No bulk and a nice feel in my large hand. I was worried at first not having a view finder (absolutely necessary on the Canon), but the bright screen on the tz5 makes a view finder unnecessary.

I hope I can get some of my pictures on this site so you can see for yourself. It is one astounding little camera!</Content>

<Content>Ok, I bought this camera a week ago and have had it for about 3 days...I tested the macro, movie modes and Panasonics new IA mode, to which you cant go wrong. 

I bought this camera for two main reasons, for the zoom (which is excellent) and the HD video (dont even think you can do alot of editing in your PC recorded at 720p). All worked very good, the best video I have ever seen from a pocket camera. 

The video would be best recorded to a home DVD recorder(use 640x480 30fps, but you cant record HD widescreen with todays DVD recorders with only 4.7GB of space, you see, 4-6 miniutes of a movie clip in 720p is 1gb...you need a big card!! and to record in HD you need a different capacity of DVD recorder (maybe a Hard Disk type)and a 16:9 true DVD recorder.

I love the feel and the pictures, its a little larger than expected, but why do they continue to think smaller is better, just like when they made cells so small...small devices could slip out of a larger mans hands...

Its worth its price, battery life could be better, but its a small battery...it recharges within 2 hours...

Good Docs, Decent editing software... Zoom goes to 16.9 at 3 megs or less 4:3 aspect ratio taking still shots...so much to ramble about...and the USB transfers are very fast, no need to remove the card to places pictures on the computer...does not take RAW picture files... but has plenty of Movie size options...

Update, to record to a home DVD, the High Def Mode 16:9 Aspect ratio and playback via your A/V cable to your home DVD recorder to save to DVD disk is your best option by far...very good Picture, close to a Camcorder</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera a year ago, for my wifes birthday.  I decided to wait a while before writing a review until we had a chance to use it in every possible situation in order to arrive at a useful conclusion for this review.  I consider myself an advanced amateur photographer, and I shoot with my Nikon DSLR most of the time, but I have to say that the Lumix TZ5 is one of the finest point and shoot digicams I have ever had the pleasure of using.  In some cases, it even out performs my Nikon D80.  Though I will not be trading in my D80 any time soon, this camera can hang with the best of them, if you are concerned with image quality.  Just take a look at all of the sample shots on the product page, if you need convincing.

So, now on to my review.

Image quality -

I have found the image quality to be above average outdoors under bright, sun-lit conditions as well as overcast conditions, handling exposure perfectly while in the intelligent auto mode.  Up to ISO 200, the images are very crisp and clean, with almost zero hint of noise, even in the shadows.  But as with most point and shoot digital cameras these days, it begins to suffer from the most annoying type of noise (chroma), beyond ISO 400, even outdoors.  Shooting indoors, without flash, over ISO 400 and you almost shouldnt bother, if youre looking for super crisp images.  However, it does provide images that are quite usable in many of the trick scene modes.  Also indoors, shooting in mixed light, I have found that the TZ5 has trouble chosing the correct white balance while in intelligent auto mode.  I found myself changing the preset on my own to suit the conditions.  This is fine for people who know what white balance is, but not so for those like my wife, for whom this particular camera was intended.  And it really suffers under incandescent (or halogen) lighting, tending more toward a very unattractive orange cast.  But believe it or not, while shooting in intelligent auto mode, if you take several frames under such light, the camera will begin to figure it out and you may get one good frame out of perhaps three or four.  I thought that to be as good as Ive seen in a digital camera (my nikon included).  It tends to hunt for focus indoors a lot, rendering the face detection auto-focus somewhat useless as it will find it very hard to find my 7 year olds face 5 feet from the lens, despite the AF assist lamp.  But outdoors, its right on the money.  

Resolution -

The 9.1 megapixels of this camera has plenty resolution for 8x12 prints at 300 dpi, which is how I determine the usefulness of the number of pixels it has.  At half the resolution, it will produce a print much larger with enough quality given a lack of noise, so if you take a shot outdoors, using a low ISO, you can expect VERY nice prints from this camera.  Some of the new models of this year, boasting 14 mp or higher, dont tend to appeal to me as much as they are marketed to have better quality because I know better.  So dont be tricked by the number of pixels these cameras have.

Optics -

This camera has some of the finest optics I have used in a point and shoot digicam.  The 10x zoom of this camera is supurb, the image stabilization compliments the long end of the focal length quite nicely and works well in either mode you have it set to, though I prefer mode 2 (which activates the stabilization at capture - saving the battery).  Even the extra zoom function works quite well if you can hold noise at bay.  I really cant say enough about this cameras image stabilizer.  This feature makes taking images so much more easy as you dont have to feel tenced while waiting for the camera to take.  I see no optical aberrations, and it has a very lovely, if not slightly more saturated color reproduction.

Movie mode -

I have not yet found much use for this feature, at the maximum settings, you cant record beyond 12 minutes (or so) for a single clip (which I imagine is quite good anyway), on a 4 GB SDHC card.  But the video I have recorded is good for what it came from, the sound may leave more to be desired, though.

Fit, form, and function -

This camera has a very solid feel in the hands (or hand, for we large handed folk).  Its outer case is some form of aluminum, and has a nice matte finish.  The bit of rubber on the grip is nice, and helps make this camera very comfortable to shoot with casually.  The controls are easy to figure out and all where they need to be.  The laymen photographer would likely benefit from a quick glance at the owners manual to familiarize themselves with some of the more advanced functions, but I think most would take to the understanding on their own quite easily.  The rear LCD screen is a very nice size and has great resolution and works quite well when reviewing and zooming in on images captured.  And the battery life is decent, good for a full day out and about.  One thing I would like to mention is that, as mentioned earlier, I use mode 2 for the image stabilizer and I shoot at medium resolution (5-6 mp) quite often and enjoy long battery life.  You may need to play around with different image quality and resolution settings to find your sweet spot.  I prefer the JPEG-fine quality setting at medium resolution, which gives me more space on my 4 GB SDHC card (approx. 1200 shots per card)

I originally bought this camera for my wife, to replace her aging 6 mp fuji finepix series point and shooter.  In the beginning, she didnt find much use for it, leaving it for me to play with for a while and I loved it.  In the last six months however, she has started to use it to do product shots for her handmade jewelry and accessories business she does and she absolutely loves it.  She gets more compliments on how good the images of her products are than offers to buy them.  Gotta love that tough economy, and you also gotta love this camera.  Allaround, its a great camera at a much cheaper price than I paid last year, brand new -- and a very stylish look and feel as well (we got the blue one).  So get one while you can.  Its super nice if youve got a lot of light, but suffers greatly as light diminishes.  In situations like that, I recommend taking it out of iA mode, selecting a lower ISO, and letting the image stabilizer work for you.  Youll tend to get much better results.</Content>

<Content>Hi, I am sorry. This is more of a question than a review. 

This goes out to everybody that purchased a Panasonic Luminex camera in a color other than silver. I am planning to purchase a blue or red color Luminex camera. However, since I have only owned silver color cameras, I am not sure if the blue or red will look old and tired a year from now due to normal wear and tear plus the unavoidable scratch here and there. 

What has been your experience? Would you recommend sticking with silver or go all out with color? Your comments are greatly appreciate it.

<Content>Ive only had this camera about a week and Im already in love with it. My previous Canon digital cameras over the last 5 years were: A10, A410 and A620. Ive passed them on to loved ones with no complaints. BUT, this Panasonic blows away anything in the same class/price bracket. The WIDE angle lens is INCREDIBLE - do not view this feature as merely another plus. Once you start taking shots with a field as wide as this camera offers, youll wonder how you did without it. The 10x zoom is quite sharp and the iA feature keeps things from getting to noisy/blurry at the end of the lens. The buttons work great, the menu is easy (much like a Canon actually) and the build quality is very high. The screen is BRIGHT and SHARP and everyone will say WHOA! when they see the image. The resolution is stunning for a 3.x screen. The picture quality is very, very good for the price. Get an extra battery, cuz it will suck em dry pretty quick. No regrets, no complaints.</Content>

<Content>The camera lens has excellent quality, and the ability to create panoramic like shots is also excellent.

However, my one fault with this camera, and it is a big one, is that the lcd screen on the back is very fragile.  I had mine in a camera bag with my canon slr camera (nothing sharp), and the lcd screen cracked.

Since on this camera the only way you can preview a picture is with the lcd screen on the back, with this broken the camera is essentially useless.

I loved the quality of the photos, but I will not be purchasing this brand of camera again due to durability issues and the fact that there is no viewfinder to look through in case of an lcd misfunction/breakage.

<Content>My wife and I bought this just before a trip to Costa Rica. We mostly shoot family stuff but sometimes, as on this trip, shoot in more challenging situations. We wanted something with more than the typical 3X to 4X zoom to capture wildlife, but something still small enough to tote through the jungle. Ease of use and intuitive controls were also high on our list. Weve had some real stinkers in this regard.

The reviews we read were mostly very positive with a few mentioning battery life as a down side. We bought an extra battery but really didnt need it. We shoot mostly stills, if you are shooting video this may be more of an issue, but we could easily shoot and review for a day or two without needing to recharge the battery.

Overall, we are very pleased with the camera. Qulity is excellent, and it is very easy to use. We were up and running quickly and it did well in both low-light and back-light situations, though picture quality diminishes, as is typical with any camera. We really like the zoom options.

<Content>This is the second digital camera Ive purchased.  The first was an Olympus Camedia C-740.  The Olympus C-740 was a good camera when it was introduced, but there were always things about it that annoyed me - like the long shutter lag, poor auto-focus, poor low-light sensitivity, etc.  When I decided to buy a new digital camera I wanted to be sure it did not have any of the problems that the old one had.  After my experience with the Olympus, I was skeptical about finding a small, point-and-shoot camera with a long zoom that would perform well in low light conditions.  I did a lot of research trying to find a camera that wasnt too large, but still had impressive features at a reasonable cost.  The Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5 has exceeded all of my expectations.

I am a mechanical engineer and I design equipment used to package products in various industries.  I often need to take pictures of a customers plant prior to installing equipment as well as after install.  Most of the plants that have our equipment are poorly lit and our equipment is large enough that a flash will illuminate only a small portion of the machine - leaving much of the image dark.  With the Lumix I have been able to take clear, crisp photos in some of the worst conditions - without a flash!

Another great feature of this camera is its ability to take relatively high-resolution videos with sound.  Now I can get great stills and video without having to carry two different devices.  Plus this camera is only half the size of my old Olympus and much smaller than the camcorder I used to use for video.  The Panasonic fits comfortably in a breast pocket when not in use.

The camera is easy to use with many automatic modes to choose from.  It is comfortable to hold and all the controls are within easy reach of your thumb or forefinger.  The large LCD screen makes composing shots easy and is great for viewing the pictures you have taken.

The only drawback I can think of is that if you do use the flash it tends to drain the battery fairly quickly.  This hasnt been a problem for me since I rarely need a flash, but if you are going to be using the flash I would recommend getting a spare battery.

Overall, this is a great camera - combining excellent features and performance in a comfortably small package for a reasonable price.</Content>

<Content>   I truly enjoy using this camera!!!  I am a mom on the go who loves to catch my kids in the moment.  I am not very educated about fancy features, lighting, etc....... but I have had great luck with my pictures.  I especially appreciate all the scene settings.  It makes it much quicker to use and the camera knows whether or not to use the flash, based on your setting choice!  I have taken many pictures of my kids running, blowing bubbles and splashing in the water; they turn out clear and vivid with no blurrs or streaks.
   My only negative so far is the battery type. The battery itself works great and holds a charge for a long time; but I misplaced my charger and havent been able to charge the battery.  I missed a picture of a bluebird in my backyard because my battery finally died.  Sometimes it would be nice to be able to just throw in a couple AA batteries for a quick fix!

<Content>I take a ton of pictures, but Im not a pro by any means. I wanted a good point and shoot that would get the job done right out of the box, but still give me a little flexibility with different settings in case I needed them.  I read a million reviews before I settled on the TZ5, and even though I just about went crazy from reading, it really paid off.

I needed to replace my old 6.1 megapixel Kodak which was about 5 years old.  It was a fantastic camera and still takes great photos, but its just wearing down.  I was so pleased with my Kodak, I thought I would be loyal and so I focused on Kodaks.  After much reading and shopping, I settled on the 12 megapixel Kodak Z1285.  I got it at Wal-mart For $151. A week later I returned it and got my money back.  Apparently things have gone down a bit at Kodak since I bought my last one. Side by side comparisons of my old and new Kodak photos were ridiculous. The new Kodak was awful. Inconsistent focus and shutter speed. Indoors, the flash recharge time was agonizingly slow. The HD video was nice, but more of a gimmick it seemed to me. Even my outdoor shots in bright sunlight were of poor quality, and I tried multiple settings.  I just was not happy. Plain and simple.

So I continued looking, and was drawn to Canon next.  I almost bought the Canon A590, but the 5+ second flash recharge time was such a drawback it was a deal-killer. I then looked at the Canon A1100, the A2000 and the SD880.  I then almost got the SD880, which had great reviews and features, but honestly, once I got my hands on it, it was simply too small.  This might not be a complaint for some, but I was used to my larger Kodak, and the SD880 was just too tiny with no real grip on it. Even with a wrist strap I didnt want to chance it.

Finally I got to the TZ5 through reading various other reviews, and it really seemed to have all the features I wanted.  After getting it from Amazon, my first stop was my sons baseball game. Fantastic photos with the default settings. Brilliant colors, amazing detail - I couldnt be happier.  The zoom is phenomenal and on the other end, the macro setting is equally impressive. The wide angle is something Ive always wanted and I cant get over how much more I can fit in the frame. Its taken great still and action shots on the various settings, which are great for those of us who dont really know what were doing. The menu is very user friendly and the layout of the buttons makes sense.

The camera is a little larger and heavier than most of the point and shoots that are coming out now, but I didnt mind that at all.  The weight just make it feel sturdy, like a real camera and not a toy.  The grip is great and wont make you think its going to slip out of your hand. Plenty of room for your thumb, so you dont accidentally hit something, and the hi res LCD screen is really nice.  If youre looking for something slim to easily fit in your pants pocket, this camera is not really going to be it. Jacket pocket, yes, but in my jeans it was a bit too big. 

There are plenty of features I have yet to try out, but Im sure Ill be impressed by them as well. A little reading of the manual will reveal a  lot. Ive aslo tried the 16:9 HD video.  It was pretty nice, though the audio had a good bit of noise in it. Still great for capturing moments on video if you dont have a designated camcorder for that.

All in all, I cant complain about this camera. And tho the $220 price tag was a little more than I planned to spend, its well worth the money.  The Kodak Z1285 gave me sub par photos at my sons birthday which cant be replaced.  I wish Id have gone with the TZ5 back then.  If youre in the under $200 range, pay the extra $20 and get this camera. You wont regret it.</Content>

<Content>Overall the camera is excellent and easy to use.  The pictures turned out clear with great color, especially if you understand the different scenes and use the appropriate one.  The only complaint is that the intelligent auto mode takes on a yellow tint for indoor pictures.  The standard camera mode eliminates this issue.  I wouldnt recommend using the iA mode.  Stick with the standard mode or one of the scenes for excellent pictures.  Also, read the manual, it helps to understand all the options and explains how to quickly change between them.  The camera is worth it. I replaced a Nikon Coolpix that didnt even compare both in quality and speed.  The 10x optical zoom is worth the slight discoloration that occurs and that may need to be corrected via a software program.</Content>

<Content>After getting this camera last year, Ive recommend 4 other people with this camera, and all of them Loved the camera just as much as I do(My grandma, my aunt x 2, my friend, my cousins all loved it absolutely!!).  Why do I say its the best value camera in the price range is because:
Pros:
1. Picture Quality: Picture quality are terrific for a camera at this price and this size!!  Clear, sharp, really, no complaint at the price.
2. Wide Angle: Real wide angle picture
3. Stableness: Its Anti Shaking works very well, great for those hands that not stable
4. Size: with the image quality and stableness it gives you, its really at a great size
5. Ease of Use: Its IA is by far the best i have use so far, its easy to use, and really a no brainer.  Its the best camera for your mom, grand parent, and those whose is not an electronic geek like me!  

Cons:
1. Flash/night picture: The picture at low light and with flash is not the best, but acceptable.
2. Size: Wish is just a bit smaller, but acceptable</Content>

<Content>So far so good with this camera.  It takes breathtaking photos from macro (up close), portraits, scenic, and zoomed.  The A/V attachment to show on a TV (with music to boot) is great to show relatives while on vacation.  It has anti-shake mode to prevent blurriness as much as possible when zooming.  What prompted me to buy this model was the 10x optical zoom and the huge view screen on back.  It was worth it.

The only negatives I can say are that 1) some settings available off menus really would be easier to access as buttons on the camera itself. 2) The mode button up top (near the ON/OFF switch) turns too easily, say, when putting the camera in my pocket.  It rubs on the pant leg or my body.  So I often find myself first checking it didnt move before I snap a photo.  Some people regret not having a normal view finder, but I can honestly tell you I never used it on my previous camera.  I can frame shots MUCH better by looking at the screen.</Content>

<Content>I had Panasonic TZ3 before buying this product, I was quite satisfied with TZ3, the only problem was, it was too difficult to make a correct set-up therefore if you were not familiar with the camera, It was hard to catch a good picture, also low light conditions performance was very low.

I had a quite good research before buying this TZ5, at the end It was very similar to TZ3 (even the look) and I didnt throw my money just because it is a new version. But there was a second EISA Award for TZ5 (TZ3 also took this award 2 years ago) and they couldnt make mistake on that.

So I purchased the camera from amazon for a fantastic price and after using the camera on 2 trips and almost every conditions, I can boldly say that this product is worth for every single pennies. The IA fonction does it all, and the pictures are really awesome. 

Believe me, the better picture could be caught with a SLR Machine otherwise it is the best compact camera in earth with every aspect, from display to video, from low light captures to zoom capability. </Content>

As a multi-Canon owner I was unsure of learning new menu icons but the Lumix is fairly easy to adapt to. Love the quick menu guide.
Only downside is I do occasionally miss having an optical viewfinder and why can you only use certain IS and Aspect Ratios settings with video?</Content>

<Content>All the leading camera makers offer outstanding products for family photograhy, but after cutting through all the gadgety stuff and arcane controls that Ill never used, but the TZ5 was the only contender with a real Leica lens, 10X zoom, 28mm wide-angle, and 3 screen. Its got plenty of manual control features too. When prices were reduced because a new TZ7 model was being introduced, it reached no-brainer level.

Im not a highly skilled photographer but Im getting exceptionally high quality pictures effortlessly. I took some test shots in problem lighting and the subjects were consistently well exposed. The controls are simple, the 10X zoom rocks, the flash brightens the whole room, and the LCD screen is big and bright. And its easier to grip than the slightly smaller ultra-compacts. I look forward to becoming familiar with the manual settings to get even more out of it.

Another thing...point n shoot camera reviews usually give little space to video performance. TZ5 video is simply SPECTACULAR in daylight use. I havent done any vids in artificial light so cant comment on that. Though limited by the software to 15 minutes per shoot (EU import issues?), the 16:9 high quality setting produces home video as good as any Ive seen. Its supposed to be even better in full HD if the $35 optional component cable is used, but really I cant imagine how. And it zooms while videoing, though the autofocus might not keep up in large changes. 

Now that it seems routinely priced below $250, the TZ5 is a steal. Youll want an extra battery; the no-names are fine.</Content>

I made some of the best night time shootings with this feature, and I do not think it was meant for that purpose also. </Content>

<Content>UPDATE:  The camera actually takes some very good pictures.  The automatic mode uses scene settings to determine the appropriate mode.  The default mode uses an aperture priority and adjusts the shutter speed for exposure.  There is an action scene that uses shutter priority and adjusts the aperture for exposure.  The landscape mode is smart enough to shut off the fill flash, open the aperture, and adjust the shutter speed for exposure.  The trick is picking the right scene.  Sometimes, it is easier to put it into manual mode and manually adjust the shutter speed, aperture, and flash.

I have decided to keep the camera.  The Li-ion battery lasts longer than my older camera that uses rechargeable NiMH AA batteries.  I will eventually have to buy a spare battery for convenience.  I hope there is a NiMH spare battery available.  The reason is that Li-ion batteries only last 1 to 2 years, so it will need to be replaced.  The NiMH battery is for backup only, but will last a long time.

Hopefully, when I am ready to replace the camera, there will be one that can charge as easily as my cell phone.  

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
The camera has some great features for the price.  I bought this for the wide angle lens (an absolute must for me) and the 10x optical zoom.  The picture quality is respectable.  The fill flash works better than expected.  The light reaches beyond 12 feet, which is all you can expect from a camera like this.  The 3 LCD is larger than most, but still too small to really get a true feeling of the picture quality.  You really do not see the picture quality until you upload to a PC or print it out.  The picture stabilization feature is okay but does not work all that great or at least as good as it is hyped up to be.

There are a few shortcomings:
1.  The lack of a viewfinder makes it more difficult to frame pictures.  I would gladly have sacrificed the LCD size to have a viewfinder.
2.  The USB connection does not charge the battery.  This seems to be the norm, probably due to the required charging current.
3.  The charger that came with the camera requires the proprietary Li-ion battery to be removed from the camera.  What were they thinking?
4.  The camera is a bit heavy for its size.  I guess I could attribute that to the 10x optical zoom and the extra metal to make it happen.

I have only had the camera a very short time.  I have not completely explored all of its capabilities.  However, I am contemplating returning the camera and getting one that has been designed the way I want to use it.  I am also considering getting one that uses AA batteries.  If I have to remove the battery to recharge, why not have a phone that uses standard batteries?  That way, I can at least use AA alkalines while recharging NiMH batteries.</Content>

<Content>Im a SONY guy, always have been, so it was with some trepidation that I bought this camera.  Havent completely put it through its paces yet, but one feature has really made this purchase worth it.  The 28mm/10x Leica lens.  The fact that I can film HD video is a plus as well, although the quailty is just OK IMO so far.  I just wasnt happy with my last SONY and Im quite pleased with this camera so far.</Content>

<Content>I take this camera with me on business travel and on daily runs, so it gets bounced and exposed to all kinds of weather.  The only case I use is a $6 amphipod thats rainproof, but not padded.  Its mostly intuitive to use, but when I first got the camera, I couldnt get sharp distance pictures.  The reviews were so good on this camera I knew it had to be something I was doing and it turned out I didnt have the dial on top, and the mode selections set correctly.  Maybe five minutes in the manual and I found my error.  

I agree with another reviewer, pick up an extra battery.  The battery life is good, but this camera, including video mode, gets used a lot and one battery wont get you through a whole wedding or your kids game. I use a 16G, SDHC class 6 memory card and havent filled it yet, even on a weeks travel. Close though with video.

And weddings are one place where this thing really stars.  READ the manual first.  Force the flash off of course.  Be sure you hold the camera steady, either on a pew edge or on a unipod for example, and with the 10X zoom you can get no flash pictures no one else will have.  

This is absolutely the best point and shoot camera Ive ever owned.  Its my fourth digital and I started in this photography business with the full 35mm Pentax system and my own color darkroom.  </Content>

<Content>I took hundreds of pictures of our two children during the three weeks we owned this camera. I was impressed with the 10x zoom, the large, clear LCD screen, and the cameras build quality and size. I really wanted to embrace this camera. 

Unfortunately I was unable to achieve a large number of quality pictures. We have an old, bulky, Olympus digital camera and we always manage to get great pictures. I did my best to take quality pictures, but in the end the picture clarity just wasnt what I was looking for. We had far too many pictures that were blurry or not quite the right color. 

I returned the camera and ordered a Canon 1100 IS and so far I have been much more satisfied with the pictures.</Content>

<Content>Overall I really like this camera. The 10x zoom in such a small camera is great. The picture quality is great and although I havent taken too many indoor pictures yet, it seems like this camera does not have the red eye problem that my Canon sd600 had. My only complaint, which I saw in some other reviews, is that in movie mode the camera has trouble holding focus which results in some very out of focus sections in a lot of the movies Ive tried. Other than the focus problem, the quality of the movies is really good in the high def. mode. One other complaint is that the cable needed to show the movies in high def. on your TV is not included and must be purchased for $40.
To sum it up, Im glad I got this camera. The good points outweigh the bad. Im hoping I can figure out a way to correct the focus problem in the movies.

<Content>I have done some extensive research on the web and out of all the cameras that I found to be small in size pocket like, this one stood out better than the rest. This camera takes unbelievably good pictures and has lots of different types of settings which are already pre-configured for you. One of the best things about this camera which definitely turn my attention to it was that it took really good pictures during low light settings. So if your hanging out in a restaurant or in some bar or anywhere where there is low light this camera takes really good pictures. Other cameras I have tried like Sony brands, the pictures came out to be all dark and gloomy without much focus and lots of dots showing up in the pictures from the lights. So if your thinking of getting this camera then I definitely recommend it. </Content>

<Content>My last camera (a relatively new Kodak easyshare) had some serious malfunctions last year so I decided to ask my parents for a new digital camera as my Christmas present.  I did quite a bit of research and narrowed it down to the Panasonic TX5 and a Sony Cybershot that was about the same price and had similar functions.  After reading several reviews and talking to a few experts at Best Buy and the like, 95% of my research recommended the Panasonic.  I ended up getting it for Christmas (yes, it was planned) and I couldnt be happier with it.  I take a lot of action shots.  I have dogs I love to photograph and with the older camera (and with my friends Sony), most of the pictures come up blurry because the dogs are running around so quickly.  With the TZ5, almost all of my shots come out crystal clear.  Furthermore, there are two burst features available Ill never be able to live without.  I live on the beach and take many pictures of waves.  The burst features allow me to hold down the button (Im not a camera pro, obviously) and take literally dozens of pictures in mere seconds.  I get absolutely amazing shots of waves everytime I take my camera with me.  My only complaint with this camera is that it does NOT have a panoramic ability.  I used to take a lot of panoramics with my Kodak and loved them.  I never actually printed them because theyre awkward and I dont have any appropriate frames so I cant say Im devastated but I do miss them.  Regardless, the zoom, picture quality, and additional features of the TZ5 make this camera waaaay worth it.  I was able to buy mine on Amazon for $230.  </Content>

<Content>I did a lot of research, and I was looking for a really cheap HD camcorder.  Unfortunately every one I tried just couldnt meet my needs. I am an amateur visual effects artist and I was looking for something to do special effects test shots, and proof of concept shots.  This certainly didnt require anything expensive, and my I worked my 10 year old Sony Handycam to death for my test shots.

When I learned that Digital Cameras were coming out that could shoot in 720p with nice results I decided to start looking at them instead of camcorders.  Pretty much the entire Panasonic Lumix line is filled with great little cameras that provide a decent 3MBps (MegaBytes).  Other brands offered some competition in this area, but few could keep up with quality of pictures and video.

Reading all the reviews, and I was sold on the TZ5.  And after using it for a while, it has met and well exceeded my expectations.

In low light, video is great.  My first video in low, non-direct florescent light still produced a perfect motion capture and near flawless camera export into 3DS Max!  Ive never had a capture go so smoothly before, even sunlight shots with my handycam.

The zoom on this thing is incredible, and yes you can use the zoom while shooting HD video.  The motion stabilizer is great, and Ive never felt Ive had to turn on the flash even in moderately lit rooms.

The Intelligent Auto mode is great when you dont want to have to worry about the settings before shooting a shot, it gets the automatic settings right every time.  At 100 and 200 ISO, pictures look comparative to an SLR, and of course 400 and above get kinda grainy, but thats just standard fair.

In the compact digital camera range, there is no better camera.  And if you are looking for SLR quality, then get an SLR.  But if you are looking for something cheaper with great quality, 720p, a fantastic auto mode, and lots of features, and more portable than an SLR, your search is over.</Content>

<Content>Several years ago a professional photographer and photo historian turned me on to the great combination of a Leica lens and Panasonic electronics. I was able to take digital photos with the equivilant of a 35-450 mm close up to long lens...without a tripod due to photo stabelizing software. I was able to take photos of the bride at the alter in low light and from far away...just hand held with great effect. And...as an opportunistic photo shooter...I was so grateful for the fast shutter speed rather than the click and wait experience Id had with other digital cameras...All in all it felt like the best of a reflex camera without the hassel of multiple lenses. This new phenom..the Lumix..even let me take great sound videos...at football games...at great distances...All in all amazing. But the camera was like a full sized reflex camera..Lighter weight to be sure, but bulky. 

Now..here comes the tz5. It has all the advantages Ive listed..and even a few more...like wide angle exposure capacity...all the way to 10X zoom...in a palm sized version...for half of the price of the earlier camera. I can and do carry it with me all the time to take advantage of great shots, great light as and when it is available. I may not get the respect of the onlookers compared to using a big pro looking camera...but the result is the same...and I aways have the camera with me so dont end up regretting missing a great shot. For those of you who have been doing point and shoot...youll love the professional results you get with a Leica lens. For those of you who have been using high end cameras...youll love that you can get the same results with a point and shoot camera with artificial intelligence and a great lens...without any of the hassle of weight, multiple lenses, tripod etc. 

This is a great travel camera...many of my best photos are just snapped through a train or bus or car window...with far way views brought close with amazing resolution. But because of the superior lens it also takes professional looking high quality close up or portrait photos just using available light in doors.

This is a rave review... I almost witheld one star because the small format of the camera doesnt feel as comfortable to me as a larger one yet..and I miss being able to see through a viewer when in bright daylight. But to be honest those are difference between a large camera and small one...so that would be stingy. Love this camera.</Content>

<Content>I am very disappointed with this camera.  I actually feel kind of foolish as I researched cameras extensively before my purchase and felt that THIS was the camera for me.  This camera has a very difficult time distinguishing shadows in outdoor pictures in the automatic mode.  The pictures are very bright in places and very dark in others on the same ohoto.  I hope I am doing something wrong.  Indoor pictures are very dark without flash and pink toned with it.  I wish I had bought the camera from Best Buy instead of Amazon so I could return it for a refund.  Dont waste your money !!</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera after months of research and comparison with other cameras in the same basic class - digital compact point-and-shoot cameras.  I had a nice, small 5.0 mp camera that did just an ok job with pictures, but it only had a 3X optical zoom and a very small LCD screen.  Whenever I wanted to take nice action shots of my kids playing sports, that camera could not zoom enough to get good shots, and without any kind of steady shot - the pics were usually blurry.  I knew I could take the kind of shots I wanted if I purchased a larger camera, but I also knew that I wouldnt carry it around due to the size.
  This Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K is an amazing improvement over my other camera, and I cant be happier with my purchase. The pictures are beautiful - and the movie-mode is amazingly good. I had wanted to purchase a new camera for some time - and read review after review and spec sheets until I had practically memorized every current model available, but could not find one with the wide-angle and optical zoom range that I needed to get the kind of shots I wanted to take. I almost settled for something else, but once I found this Lumix, and researched it - against all feasible alternatives, it became apparent that this camera is the only one that would make me happy. After 3 months of research prior to selecting this camera, I can happily say that I definitely made the right choice.  I highly recommend this camera!</Content>

<Content>The Panasonic TZ5 shoots nice images outdoors, but does not perform well indoors.  Indoors it tends to shoot blurry images, and images with odd colors.

My other frustration with the camera is that it does not have manual settings. I didnt think much about this when I bought it, but after using the camera I find that I wish I could control all the settings manually, as I can with my Canon Powershot 590 (a far more affordable camera that perfoms very nicely).

The zoom on the TZ5 works well, and I appreciate the autobracket feature, which allows you to shoot images with three different exposure settings, and the burst feature, which allows you to keep shooting still images as long as you hold down the shutter button.

It does have a very nice screen. And another advantage of the TZ5 over its competitor, the Canon S110, is that the TZ5 features a wide angle lens, which I appreciate (and it is more compact than the Canon).

The bottom line is that I wish Id bought the Lumix FZ28 (because of its manual controls), but the TZ5 meets most of my needs and is quite compact, which was important to me.

<Content>  This is the third TZ series camera Ive owned. Each has been incrementally improved over the preceding model. If there is a better, pocket-sized point n shoot digital camera with a 10x zoom out there, I havent found it.

  The TZ5 has a 10x Leica lens that begins its range at 28mm. I absolutely love this feature because you can shoot a group two or three feet closer than with the more typical 35mm equivalent lens.

  Response time is typical for a point n shoot. If you need instantaneous shutter response, shell out the bucks for a DSLR.

  The built-in flash is the weakest part of this camera. It feels slow to recycle. It will not stop you from taking a shot before it has fully recycled, but your color balance and exposure will be way off. Redeye prevention seems to work pretty well. Ive had a lot fewer shots with redeye than I did with the prior model.

  I cant tell if the face detection feature is working or not. It doesnt seem to make much of a difference.

  As is the case with all Panasonic digital cameras, the optical stabilization system is marvelous, making many otherwise impossible shots a simple matter.

  Theres no optical viewfinder, but the display screen is large, finely detailed and visible in all but direct sunlight.

  Overall exposure is good. I havent had a problem in any of the several thousand shots Ive taken that I could attribute to the cameras exposure handling.

  Needless to say, at higher ISO equivalent speeds, there is noise. Just part of what youre going to get with a point n shoot.

  Movies made with the TZ5 are great. With halfway decent lighting, exposure is excellent and motion capture is very, very smooth without artifacts. I really enjoy the convenience of having a high quality motion capture capability in a digital still camera. Movies are in Quicktime format. Filesize is limited to 2GB, but you can save multiple 2GB files to a large SDHC card. Ive used up to 16GB SDGC card in the TZ5 without a problem.

  Panasonic claims about 300 shots from a battery. I feel lucky if I get 150 flash shots. Plan on buying and carrying one or two extra batteries with the TZ5. The recharger is small with folding prongs.

  All in all, this is a great pocketable point n shoot. The only serious negatives I have with it - and they are common to all cameras of this class - are a somewhat deficient flash unit and slow shutter response times.

  But for day-to-day use, just carrying it with you, I dont think you can find a better camera.

<DocID>B0011Z44UA-88</DocID>
<Content>Let me preface my review by saying that I looked into many different cameras in this category.  Id like to share some of my findings in order to help those who may be in a daze like I was trying to decide which compact camera to choose.  First of all, one has to accept that a compact camera is not going to take as good of pictures as a digital SLR or as good as some of the larger cameras that are in the mid-range between the two.  Ive read lots of reviews on compact cameras, and there isnt one cameras I found where somebody doesnt say that it takes terrible pictures, over-exposes, is noisy, doesnt portray the right colors, bad LCD, fragile, etc.  One just has to filter through some of these and understand that some people have bad experiences with a camera or expect too much from it (really high standards).

Here are some of the models I considered before buying the TZ5, and my own personal reasons for not purchasing them:

Nikon S610 - Yellowish LCD screen, inability to exit menu quickly when wanting to use camera in an instant.

Canon SD880IS - Lots of reviews about poor low light performance, LCD has black bar at the bottom that reduced the size of the screen (that could have been just the one I used at the store), plus my previous camera was a Canon and I was just looking for something different.

Sony DSCW300 - Didnt want to invest in memory stick switchover - Otherwise, would have considered.

So, on to why I picked the TZ5:

10x Zoom - Nice feature in a mid-compact size

Low-light performance - Performs well in low-light

LCD Clarity - Huge LCD that is easy to look at and is very clear.

Ease of use - I love all the features, but my wife is concerned with having a camera she can point-and-shoot with ease, which this does nicely.

Face detection, 9MP, Image-stabilizer, SDHC compatibilty, 720p video

The camera is larger than the other models that I mentioned, but unless you are really into a super-small camera then this shouldnt be a problem.  Again, the increase in the size of the camera allows for a better build and higher quality, in my opinion.

Also, dont get caught up in the how many megapixels the camera has.  Unless you need poster sized prints, 9-10MP is all you really need.  Anything larger creates huge files that need storage somewhere, and will need to be resized when sharing them.

All in all I recommend the TZ5.  It was the perfect camera for our needs.  Good luck in your own search.

Update:  Ive read some of the reviews about how the pictures dont look as good on their computers as it does on the camera.  I noticed that my pictures look great on my newer LCD monitors (TV and computer), but not so much on my older laptop.  The quality of the viewing montior does make a difference in color and sharpness.</Content>

<Content>We used to carry our camera (Kodak DC290) and camcorder (Sony TRV-9) around in a fairly cumbersome carrying bag. Now we just have to carry this camera around.

Pros:
    - Good enough camera and camcorder in one easy to carry device
    - Quick to turn on and quick between pictures - especially if no flash
    - Rarely need flash
    - Easy to use and navigate settings
    - Amazingly good display
    - Good in low light (basketball games)
        Use High Sensitivity scene mode, or High Burst scene mode,
        or take video and easily save frames as photos during review  

Cons:
    - Picture not as vibrant as my old Kodak on default setting and
        too vibrant on vibrant setting
    - No way to automatically stamp date on each picture
        Must create copy during review or use included computer software
        to stamp after transferring to computer
    - Video zoom in and out is sluggish and 
        has trouble focusing sometimes when zooming in unless
        you started video zoomed in to begin with
    - Recording in high-def can on occassion be jumpy
       (even with high speed card)
    - ITunes\QuickTime cant keep up sometimes playing high-def clips
        on the computer

<Content>i was thrilled about the hi-def video, but when i wanted to use the software to edit a couple clips with transitions, it wont let you save it in the original resolution, which i dont understand at all...basically, it saved the video to a file that is no longer hi-def.
if you try to burn a DVD.....nope...not gonna happen. it only burns VCD on cd-rs...why would you bundle software that doesnt want anything to do with 720p?
the camera is great. it feels solid, battery life is good, and it takes really nice pics.  overall im loving it, but had to knock it down 1 star for the software...does anyone have ideas on some other software? it really shoots nice 720p .MOV files.</Content>

<Content>Overall a very excellent camera that is well constructed and thought out. I like the fairly intuitive menus and operation. It is a bit more bulky than most compacts, but thats the tradeoff for the 10x zoom, I guess. Impressive LCD screen and quality of photos. Video is okay, but dont expect digi-cam results if you need professional imagery. Its very tough to keep the camera stable when taking videos and sound is mono, but sensitive enough to record from a decent distance. So, a little pricey in my opinion but you have a well rounded, features packed camera with a world class Leica lens.</Content>

<Content>Very good camera. I have never seen another camera pack such a high zoom in this size. This is not your ultraslim eye catcher. It is sort of chunky but will ft into a small case nevertheless. Wont fit in your jeans pocket probably, but will easily fit in your jackets pocket. 

This has the best LCD I have seen, large (3) and very clear and nice to look at. Picture quality is amazingly good, the different scene modes offer a wide variety of choices and settings, there are 22 scene modes, with some pretty unusual ones. I love the aerial view mode, which lets you capture amazing shots from a height. Picture quality is great, night mode is specially good. I love the intelligent auto mode, its phenomenal. Close up shots offer great details. 

this has a 28mm wide angle Leica lens with image stabilization, that speaks for itself. 
The navigation and menu is well organized and the camera is very easy to use. 

The only things that I wish in this camera is manual option, for shutter speed and aperture controls.

Overall, great buy for a good price. This is a perfect travelers companion- good picture quality, easy to use and small enough to carry around everywhere. </Content>

<Content>  Quite simply the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5A meet all of my travel writing photo needs. Gone are the days of carrying a gear bag and heavy lenses. This small, (relatively) compact digital camera fits comfortably in a loose pocket and takes remarkably clear photos. Having gone through a handful of digital cameras over the last five or so years Ive found the Lumix to be a good, dependable camera. Ive used it for photos for several dozen articles and like it for its ease, convenience and image clarity.
  If it doesnt take great photos then its probably not the cameras fault, its mine. 
  A good bargain for the price.  </Content>

<Content>My wishlist when buying a camera:  size (must be small enough to tuck in a coat pocket or purse), optical zoom of 4x minimum, manual controls for shooting in unusual situations, 6Mpixel minimum, short video capable.

This camera met all those except the manual control.  However, it has a large number of operating modes including low light sensitivity, which worked very well when photographing my sons band concert, and various night scene modes.  The intelligent Auto mode usually does a great job of selecting exposure, aperture, and ISO, but is easy enough to override by going to another mode if necessary.

The auto-focus can be a bit slow in some modes, e.g., photographing at night.  But it does focus well.  Speed seems perfectly fine during the day.  Nice default color rendering.  The 10x optical zoom is awesome!

It does put all sorts of tags in the metadata (vacation location, vacation time, mode used, auto mode details), but I cant seem to access them from Adobe or most other photo tools.  I can only see the data when using the photoFunstudio software that comes with the camera.  The traditional metadata such as f#, exposure, ISO is accessible from Adobe and other tools, just the specialty data is hard to find.

<Content>I have been searching for a replacement camera for an old Canon 2.3Meg digital I had for years. After much research I chose the DMC-TZ5. I couldnt be happier. It is easy to set up right out of the box and the pics are fantastic. I would set it up to normal mode which you program the settings or you can use the intelligent setting--in intelligent setting I found lower light pics tended to be yellow and underexposed. Not with normal mode. Pics were dead on great, every time, with color and exposure perfect. As others have recommended in my research I would limit the ISO setting to 400 to reduce noise which you can set in normal mode (not intelligent mode). 

Highly recommend a screen protector for the beautiful 3 screen (and it is unbelievably pretty and clear). Also get an extra battery just in case. Both of these I picked up on Ebay for under $30 (US). Original battery is rated 1000mAh but aftermarkets (like mine) are available that will give 1800mAh (longer use on a full charge--almost twice).

DO NOT try to get for less than $249 as I originally did. One place said in stock, and for $179, but when the order was placed I received an e-mail (3 days later) that they are out of stock for 3-4 weeks! Then I find after I cancelled the order they raised the price to $199. Amazon.com is reasonable and the shipping was spot-on-quick (received 4 days from payment!). Stick with amazon and forget everyone else...</Content>

<Content>This camera has an excellent Leica 10x optical zoom lens at 9m that will give you almost 17X optical zoom at 3m. You can use the zoom in HD video mode, something much larger mega zooms dont even offer. The picture quality is fantastic as is the 3 lcd screen. Battery life is excellent but have a spare and be sure its a PANASONIC. Packed with great features, there is no other point and shoot on the market that offers what this camera does The DMC-TZ5 has an excellent build quality and is small enough for coat pockets and purses. I would recommend this camera to anyone.

<Content>My wife and I researched many different models of Megazoom Cameras before we decided on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K. We are the casual type photographers but we take a ton of pictures. If you want a point and shoot camera for a reasonable price then we highly recommend this one. We have been greatly pleased with its performance. It has excellent picture quality, even at full 10x optical zoom. One feature we liked are the many different scene selections, but we were disappointed that it lacked the panoramic feature. It does however have a wide angle lens which does help out on the wide shots. It is very easy to use, but you do have to be careful not to cover the flash bulb or the mic while shooting. This is very easy to do, but once you get the hang of it, its pretty easy to avoid. We purchased a 16 GB HDSC card to go along with it, which gives you about 3500 pictures at the full 9.1 megapixel setting which is great. This is a great camera with a huge lcd screen and although it lacks the viewfinder, we didnt seem to miss it all that much. If you are in the market for a good point and shoot camera, look no further. </Content>

<Content>I have had this camera for many months now and I carry it with me everywhere.  I have a neoprene Lowepro attached to my fanny pack through the belt velcro and love it.  Bought the car charger for $18 and 2 spare batt for $6 each.  Also bought Hoodman Raw 16Gig card $149 and love it. Only ram that doesnt mess up the long videos I take and keeps up with the pic write speeds.  Camera is very easy to use and has great flash and battery use time.  My father has the dmc-tz3, my uncle who owned and opperated his own camera repair for 19 years owns the dmc-tz4, and now I have the dmc-tz5 which I am incredibly happy with.  10 optical lens is awesome.  It is not a camcord though so fucus motors in video mode have trouble like all others in focusing sometimes but the fucus motors for the pic taking are perfect.  Alway use the safety cord around the wrist though!!!!!!!!!!!! So you dont loose or break your precious camera.  I did buy the cool pixs S60 for my girl friend for xmas because she will only use slim line cameras but it is dmc-TZ5 for me.  Hope that helps</Content>

<Content>I own this camera for about 6 months and like it lot.
Pros: 
1.	Wide Angle lens Zoom allows you to take good out door pictures.
2.	I found intelli mode good enough for most pictures. I tried other modes especially sports mode and it works well, other wise you will get blurred picture. 
3.	I like that it has rechargeable Lithium ion battery instead of regular AA batteries which were pain with my previous Cannon models. I have taken about 80 -100 pictures before the battery was completely discharged.
4.	3.0 Screen is very good and useful.
5.	Quality of Video and sound quality was good, especially for category of compact cameras

Cons: 
1.	In low light conditions you may not get good pictures. I wish the flash was little more powerful.
2.	I did not see good quality pictures in Hi-Speed Burst mode 
3.	I found Fireworks mode to be practically useless.
4.	I wish it had a view Finder and External flash attachment.

<Content>After many years of bumming off of other friends and family to take pictures for me, I finally decided to buy my own camera. After countless hours and days of research, I decided on this panasonic lumix DMC-TZ5 and Im so glad I did. There were many other digital cameras I was looking at (sony cybershots, nikons, olympus etc.) and some had really cool features such as touch screens. As a college student who has many friends taking pictures at parties and all the albums showing up on facebook, I wanted a camera that would impress everyone, as well as the picture quality obviously.

I looked at touchscreen Sony cybershots for a long time, but after reviewing the price and the difficulty of actually using the screen, having a cool touchscreen to show off really is not worth it at all.

The Panasonic Lumix, however, is gorgeous. its pretty small and fits comfortably in your hand, and the zoom 10x power simply is irreplaceable. the pictures on the 3 inch LCD screen show up beautifully, huge and crystal clear, and the movies taken can be pretty lengthy and come out pretty clear as well. the interface of the camera is simple to use and has many more options for the advanced users. the battery lasts a really long time and the price for the camera is great compared to some other lower-rated brand name cameras. buy this camera, and you wont regret it at all. if nothing else, look at how many people reviewed this camera and how high its rating is :)</Content>

<Content>This is my third Lumix camera.  The first was the FZ20, a 12X zoom the size of a 35mm SLR.  The FZ20 was excellent for the kind of amature tavel-family-wildlife photography I do except for its size and bulk.  I have excellent pictures from all over the USA and from China to Italy.  Then I saw the TZ3 with its 10X zoom, but fitting in a shirt pocket size.  I purchased it one week before going to Turkey and Greece.  The pictures were a major dissapointment.  Blurry, dark, slow to focus, I started looking for a Nikon or Cannon with similar features.  I was unable to find any.  Then the TZ5 came to market with a new engine, promising corrections and better features than the TZ3.  I decided to take a chance.  I purchased it along with an 8 gig memory card and was off to Peru and the Galapogas Islands.  The camera performed flawlessly right out of the box.  The new engine is great.  I have over 1000 beautiful photos from that trip .. well, they arent all great, but thats me, not the camera.  My FZ20 is now in a box (along with the TZ3) and I am looking forward to a few good years of enjoyment with my TZ5.  Pros: Wide Angle, Auto mode selection in iA setting, easy access to flash control and Record/Play swtch, good zoom, sharp lens, worked well in low light without flash, image editor on cd is quick and pretty good.  Cons: Short battery life (buy more than one), no viewfinder, small buttons to get used to, need to buy a good case extra.   </Content>

<Content>Unfortunately, we really cant comment on the camera.  It was a Christmas present, packed in our suitcase on an international journey courtesy of NorthWest and KLM.  NorthWest had equipment problems and we were dealyed two days en route in Boston, and KLM lost all our bags where we connected, and they arrived four days later, just a few hours before our return.  The camera had been stolen from one of our bags in Amsterdam - we never got chance to use it.  Guess what?  The airlines dont accept responsibility for the theft of anything like that from checked bags.  We had tried to carry the bag on too, but were not allowed.  We think it probably was a good camera - perhaps the person in Amsterdam who has it now can complete this?.</Content>

<Content>Thank you to the previous reviewer. He/she hit the nail right on the head.
I couldnt have said it better. Friends wondered if Id ever FINALLY buy a camera. I researched for ages and was focused on the FX5 but was watching for best price and bingo, one day, there it was. Bought through Amazon free S/H. Also bought another reviewers suggestion for case and SDHD card which actually came with its own card reader. Brilliant. Right out of the box I could set the time and date. I knew I was on a roll. Its ready to go in IDIOT MODE. I know there are setting and features I may never learn, but for my needs thus far Im doing great. Shots taken with zoom are amazing. Deer at the back of our property shot through a window and 2 sets of screens came out great with my 1st try. Since I purchased this camera 2 of my friends have purchased also.

<Content>Picking a digital camera can be a frustrating project. I spent quite a lot of time doing research and testing numerous cameras from the major vendors. If you are looking for a high quality digital camera that is capaple being carried on your person easily then look no further and buy the PANASONIC TZ5S! This is why and what you should keep in mind.
1. Quality: This camera is extremely well made with great fit and finish.
2. Picture Quality: It takes excellent pictures in all environments. Keep this in mind, most people want a digital camera that they can carry with them, is easy to use, takes great quality pictures, and doesnt cost an arm and a leg. This camera does all that and then some. The majority of photos taken are of family events and friend be it inside or out. The rest is of places or things of interest, ie; vacations, monuments, scenenry on trips, etc. The Leica Lens on this camera is one of the best lenses available. A poor quality lens will almost always hurt actual picture quality. It is also a a 28mm wide angle lens which is far better than the standard 35mm - 38mm lens on many cameras in this class. This will allow you to get a larger area to fit into the picture your taking. You wont have to say, Everyone get closer together, squeeze in,
It also has a great zoom lens, allowing you to get much closer to objects or whatever you want to take a picture of. When you see a camera that says 3 optical 10 digital Pay more attention to the optical zoom number. The higher the optical zoom number the better in almost all cases. The TZ5S has 10 optical, plus 28mm wide angle which is far better numbers than most other cameras in this class. This will allow you far more flexibilty.  
3. Price Point; I bought this from AMAZON and not a 3rd party vendor and got a price that was way better than any of the big retailers, by a large margin...$100.00 less at a minumum. A big bang for the buck w/out question. It was delivered at n/c and in 2 days.
4.EXTRAS: Like I said, most people want to be able to grab there camera, turn it on quickly, and take a high quality photo consitantly. In addition to this, the TZ5S allows you to take quality videos like that of a camcorder and can do so in High Definition.
5. Ive kept this as simple as I can because you can get lost in all features you will never use.  Bottom line is this.
This camera is well built, easy to use, has a very high quality..wide angle lens, and a powerful 10 power optical zoom lens, can take video in HD, and produces excellent photos. Other popular brands like Canon, Casio, and Sony all make decent quality cameras. But you wont find a better quality camera with as many powerful feature rich options, at this low a price when compared side by side with the other brands. 
I wrote this review for the average consumer trying to navigate through the maze of digital cameras out there, not the professional photographer who looks at every little techinal specification. Not that there is anything wrong with that, I just want the majority of you to know this is one excellent digital camera you will be happy with for many years to come. Hope this helps.

<Content>I have owned a Lumix TZ3 for a couple of years now, so bought the TZ5 for my husband for Christmas. He loves it. The monitor is large and the 10x optical zoom creates great pictures from remote locations. The newly rearranged buttons was a great improvement. I recommend this if you want a small point and shoot with some great features. The only down side is that there is no view finder, so in bright sunlight the monitor can be hard to see, but it does have an option to change the angle which helps.</Content>

<Content>This camera is very nice but to me it did have few set backs. From the time you click the button for your picture and the time the pic is actually taken was a bit slow but I havent adjusted any settings yet on my camera. I believe there is a setting for that on there though. In my opinion if you are trying to take quick pics from the beginning this camera is not for you. I have young kids and is very hard to take pics with them moving all the time. And when you take pictures there is a red light that shines in peoples face. Although you do have the advantage of panoramic pics and one touch click that takes several shots one after the other i think they would have to be preplanned before you take them. The camera was actually smaller than I thought it was which was a plus. Picture come out very clear which impressed me. This camera supports a 16 gb SD card which is nice as well.

<Content>My favorite things:
- size and weight. 
- the zoom. My old camera was a 5x zoom and it frustrated me to not have more.
- the wide angle. You get more people in a picture.
- the large LCD display. So, far, I have not had any problems with not being able to see, even in bright sunlight. I live in Southern California, so even though it is winter, there is lots of sun. 
- the ease of using the menu systems. I can set most basic functions without having to read the manual.
My least favorite things:
- the way the large LCD extends beyond the frame of the camera. I am sure it is going to get scratched with a lot of use. I am taking it on a trip soon and well see.
- the picture file naming system. I am used to a Canon, which numbers the picture according to date and starts each day as number 1. I have set the travel feature, so maybe that will take care of that problem.
- the case that I bought for it. It is the one made specifically for this camera by Panasonic and was fairly expensive. I would not buy it again. The camera barely fits in it and there is no room for extra batteries. Also, the fit is so tight, I think the LCD may get scratched, so I wrap the camera in a soft lens-cleaning cloth.

I would definitely recommend the camera for its feature and definitely not recommend the case.</Content>

<Content>Love the design of the camera - easy to figure out the power, review and action switches.  The wheel at the top of the camera is in a good place so that it is not easily bumped to the wrong setting while in use.

Battery has a nice long life - which is a nice change from the Canon I just retired.  

There are so many features, though, that I am still in the learning phase with what all can be done - and what setting should be used for various situations.  Right now, its a lot of trial and error.  It would be nice if there was some sort of tutorial included with the software.  

One feature of the camera I love is the facial recognition on the display.  When taking pictures, it will recognize different faces in the shot and give extra focus on them.  Not sure how many it will recognize at one time, but weve had up to 6 people in one pic and it put the focus box on each of them.  (It pretty much has to see at least a nose and 2 eyes for the recognition to happen.)

Basically - after all of the research I did, I love my choice - and the price here on Amazon could not be beat.  (At the time I purchased, it was a full $100 cheaper than I could find it anywhere else.)  I just need to get out there and figure out what all I can do with it.</Content>

<Content>It seems like the reviews for this camera around the various sites on the internet were really good.  I bought the camera largely based on those reviews.  Id say Im not completely disappointed but I may have continued shopping if I were more familiar with some of the cons.

The pros:
Under most lighting conditions it takes beautiful pictures.  
It is compact for a 10X optical zoom camera
The movie quality is fantastic.  It prevents the need to have a separate camcorder (unless you are taking serious video)
It is pretty quick performance-wise

the cons:
there are some pics that look soft around the edges
there is a lot of noise in low light conditions.  A LOT of noise.  This is the big disappointment of the camera.

Over all, its a decent camera, but I would have spent a little more money and given up the compact size for better low-light pics.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for my family as we needed a small digital slim camera to take with us on vacations that would fit in a pocket or purse. I did alot of research because I wanted a minimum 9MP camera with maximum zoom and HD Video capabilities. I chose the Panasonic TZ5K and I am happy I made the right decision! It takes wonderful pictures in Intelligent Auto mode and sharp HD videos that playback perfectly on my Pioneer Plasma 50 TV. Panasonic has hit a Home Run with the TZ5 camera and Amazon always has the best price with fastest delivery. I would recommend both to everyone!</Content>

<Content>I did a lot of research before deciding on this camera.  There really arent many options if you want a compact camera with a big zoom lens.  I have had the camera for a couple of weeks and have really enjoyed using it.  The overall performace is great, it looks good, and it has a nice size and feel.  The video is quite good for digital still camera (this isnt a camcorder).  The major weakness I have noticed so far is what I had read about before I purchased it: it doesnt take great pictures in poor lighting.  While the pictures arent terrible in such conditions, it is noticeably worse than other environments.  This is THE camera for casual users or for someone like me who cant afford multiple cameras, wants good pictures with a lot of zoom, and needs a compact camera size.</Content>

<Content>My girlfriend has been trying to get me to start taking pictures again and gave me this camera for Christmas. The manual was a tad daunting at first...but a few hours later I was happily shooting away. I learned photography on a SLR (do we say analog camera now?). The TZ5 was very easy to migrate to from an SLR. Do get the memory cards...the on board memory will hold less than 12 high-quality photos. The other positive reviews will give you the technical perks and potholes. Excellent choice..... </Content>

<Content>I bought the Panasonic TZ5 because I usually buy Canons and wanted to see what else was available in the compact camera market. I wanted a camera that was lightweight and pocketable - two words that I would not use to describe my Canon G9. I wanted image quality that was good enough as is - clear detail and accurate color without requiring me to fix it. I was not concerned with lots of manual control - I have my G9 in my bag (but not my pocket).

I was not especially impressed with the TZ5 when I played with it at the local Best Buy, but I attributed that to the floor model being pretty beat up. After receiving one from Amazon, I compared the results with my wifes SD870 IS; both inside the house and outdoors. Indoor pictures were very yellow with the TZ5 - none of the white balance settings yielded good results. Outdoors, the TZ5 tended to wash out images and lose fine detail. In automatic mode, the Canon consistently turned out better pictures (in my opinion) than the Panasonic.

In the end, Im going to return the TZ5 and get an SD880 IS. The Canon is smaller, lighter, and produces better looking pictures; too bad it cant also have that fantastic 10x Leica zoom lens.</Content>

<Content>We got this for Christmas to replace, or I guess supplement our Nikon D70S D-SLR, which is a great camera, but too bulky, cumbersome, and has too many bells and whistles for just casual photography. We were looking for a different camera that was easier to use, a lot smaller, but still had good image quality and long-telephoto capabilities without having to lug around a 2-lb 70-300mm SLR zoom lens. We settled on the Panasonic DMC-TZ5. I looked at the Canon Power Shot SX110IS (a great camera by the way) after narrowing it down, and the Panasonic won out, mostly due to its smaller size, and the price was right. Retailers offer this camera at anywhere from $299-329. Costco sold it in a blister back for $239.

This is a great camera. The body is constructed of aluminum and sturdy plastic, so it should last a long time and hold up to mild bumps and bruises. Its not that compact, unlike some of the Olympus, Casio, Sony, Canon, and Kodak cameras out there, but then again, they dont offer a 10X zoom capability. Its small enough to fit into a purse, or a coat pocket, but dont plan on putting it into your pants pocket. 

Its loaded with useful and easy-to-use features. With 10 megapixels, its an upgrade from the TZ3 and 4 models, which had 7 and 8 megapixel CCDs. it also has an improved software package, which is designed to address a glaring problem found in the other DMC models. It will also shoot 720i high definition video (1280x720 DPI) at 30 frames per second. 

Although this is what I consider to be an easy-to-use point-and-shoot camera with a lot of automatic functions, its still got some level of manual control. On the outside, it doesnt get any simpler than this. Looking at the top of the camera, theres a function dial with only 6 positions, an on-off switch, e-zoom button, shutter release, and zoom rocker. On back is the 3 TFT LCD screen, a switch that changes from camera mode to photo playback, multifunction D-pad, a display and quick menu buttons. 

What sold me on it was the lens. Its unusual for digital camera of this nature to have a premuim lens set. Its a 10X optical zoom wide-angle Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens, which is a step above the branded-lenses that come with most cameras. It offers 4.7-47mm (28-280mm 35-mm equivalent with an effective focal-length of F3.3-4.9) with optical image stabilization. Only Sony and Kodak include these (Some of Sonys better camera include Carl Zeiss lenses, and Kodak uses Schneider-Kreuznach lenses). These are high-end lens sets, and they make the most of the small CCDs found in compact cameras. This lens is so good, that the cameras imaging software struggles to keep up with the optics. It wouldnt be unfair to say that the camera cant make the most of the optical quality of the lens! 

With the function dial in the IA setting, just point and shoot for very good pictures. Theres some manual control in this mode, but to make the most of the cameras capabilities, it needs to be in the normal picture mode. ISO, white balance, exposure compensation, shutter speed, and flash are all adjustible, which is good, because although Panasonic has addressed the problems of the TZ4, they are still present in the TZ5. The problem is lots of noise at high ISO (above 400), and lots of sharpening and noise compensation to boot. I dont recommend using this camera at any ISO above 400 unless youre shooting in bright sunlight or under good indoor lighting. 200-400 ISO works just fine, and leaving the ISO in automatic mode helps a lot. White balance is also adjustible, but again, leaving it in automatic works fine. 

At high zoom, theres the usual non-SLR ghosting and barrel distortion, but its not as bad as in other mega-zoom cameras in my opinion. The optical image stabilization works great and is absolutely necessary for high-zoom. The LCD is broght and the resolution is excellent at 460,800 DPI. 

Overall, despite the persistant noise problems, this is an excellent camera, and takes great pictures for such a small CCD. Its not a D-SLR or SLR replacement, but a good stand-by when lugging around a SLR isnt possible ror practical.

<Content>This camera has virtually no ability to take night pictures at all.  Most of them turn out discolored red or yellow by the awful automatic white balancing.  If I force it to another white balance mode its ok, but then you forget to take it out of that mode, and mess up another batch.

In the daytime, photos arent much better.  Blurry, grainy, lacking in color depth - they seem very flat and boring, even in vivid color mode.  Overall, a large disappointment - my ancient Fujifilm Finepix F3 has it beat by a large margin.</Content>

<Content>Great zoom, iA mode best for outdoor pics-and it does figure out Macro mode well automatically. For indoors though with incandescent light blubs its best to use the semi-manual mode with the white balance set to the light bulb icon for incandescent lighting. Then pictures are reliably the right color. In iA mode indoor-hit or miss, many pictures have a yellow/orange tinge.
Cool feature is that you can then preload SCN1 and SCN2 with the customizations you like for say action and twilight.
The red-eye reduction flash (both modes) requires the subject to stay still till all the flashes go.
For taking pictures of cats definitely use the Slow Red-Eye reduction mode.
10X zoom is hard to hold still-but 3X in all the other point and shoots in this range is not enough-7x is just right-not too shaky and its the zoom you often need.
Does true 4:3. 3:2 (4x6 photo) and true 16:9 for that full widescreen look-and and video too.</Content>

<Content>After exhaustive research online and in-store, and much comparative shopping, I was ready to order the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K through Amazon.com, when I found it at BH for only $219.95  vs. $238, plus $6.15 for 2-day shipping at Christmas (much cheaper than Amazons vendor). I have used it for only a brief time but have found:
1. The camera feels and looks very well made and sturdy. I like the black finish.
2. The instruction manual, software guide, camera buttons, and on-screen user interface are easy to understand.
3. I was able to take pictures and download directly through Adobe Bridge CS3 without installing any additional software Windows XP Pro.
4. The 10x optical zoom, image stabilization, manual override of all the basic controls, a reasonable megapixel image size, the high-quality video, price range, and a pocket-sized camera body were all the primary features I was looking for in carry-around camera.
5. Last feature I really appreciate - rechargeable battery with separate recharger, just like my Canon DSLRs.</Content>

<Content>I used to have an older Lumix model that I found great. I bought this one because of the powerful zoom.

The problem is that the quality of the pictures is absolutely terrible. When I see them on the LCD, they look great, but when I transfer the photos to the computer, they are all blurry, as if I had taken the pictures at low quality and was trying to zoom them.

It was a surprise because I had read the reviews before buying and most people recommended it. So, I am thinking: either I have bad luck and my camera came screwed up or I dont know how to use it, which might be the case, but then, it wouldnt be a point-and-shoot camera.

1. The camera takes excellent pictures at 10x optical zoom even through a glass window
2. Pre-confiured settings for baby/night shots/candle/party etc are very useful
3. All the needed setting changes are handy either on the screen or through other buttons
4 Easy to tranfer the pictures to PC. just connect and the flash drive shows up
5. You can use any standard micro SD card

Cons
1. USB port seems to be proprietary. I guess it is a variant of standard min-USB port but you can still get the cables if you happen to lose the company supplied one

<Content>First let me clarify. I love this camera, Consider the size, the cost and the result. It is a great camera. the reason I give it 2 stars is because I think there are a few things the manufacturer can easily improve but they didnt.

There are enough reviews tell you about the good things, so I am only going to focus on the negative points:

* Why use Motion-JPG to record video? Not only the video file is ridiculously large, it also limits the max recording time(at 720p) to only about 10 minutes, thats way too short. Panasonic should definitely consider MP4 format. This is the single biggest issue I have with my TZ5.
* The location of the Mic is not premium, its on top of the camera where you usually put your left hand on, easily blocked by your fingers, they should move it to below the lens.
* The quality of the sound recording is fairly poor, even at in-doors you hear enough noise, recording outside in windy condition is impossible.
* Manufacturers should stop pumping up pixel count and really do some work on low light condition and noise control. The pictures produced by TZ3(which I also own) and TZ5 does not have much difference, it doesnt justify the 2M pixel increase.
* In outdoor daylight the pictures are beautiful, but indoor low light condition is really a challenge for this camera, especially in video recording when you cant use flash.
* Panasonic should consider switching Component output to HDMI. And include an HDMI cable in the package. Most mordern LCD TV doesnt have component input on the side or front. In my case it is particularly bad since my LCD TV is mounted on the wall, I cant reach the component input located at the back. RCA output from this TZ5 is pretty bad.
* They should consider adding an accessory shoe to mount a video light.
* Some button design is not premium, like the main dial on top  of the camera. I dont know why they put Scene1 and Scene2 between the Photo mode and Video mode. Photo and Video modes are the two most commonly used modes, others are barely used.
* The Optical Stability system does work, but still not enough, most videos produced without tripod are still jitty. Especially when you view them on your big screen LCD TV. Although this is a tricky one, I am not sure how much panasonic(and other manufacturers) can improve on this area.
* Optical zooming in video mode is too slow(well, better than TZ3 which cant use optical zoom during video mode), Focus while zooming(in video mode) is even worse.

Anyone has a solution? The Panasonic support site is no help.

<Content>This is my first digital camera.  The most noticeable thing after a few weeks is the delay between pressing the button to take a picture and the actual time the photo is taken.  It does not seem to be due to extended apature time (same issue in bright or dim light).  But it is a bit more pronounced when a flash is needed.  Photo quality it very nice, though I dont know how it compares to others.  Automatic settings for different action/lighting situations is a great feature.  Candlelit pictures and party pictures came out fantastic just using the auto settings.  The camera is easy to use right out of the box.  Other than the shutter delay it is a very nice camera.  </Content>

<Content>My friend brought the Panasonic Lumix TZ5 9.1MP from Costco and ended up returning it.  Heres what she had to say:

* Overall, the Lumix was difficult to use for indoor photos.
* When there are different light sources, strange artifacts appear in the photos.  Specifically, flares and sparkles appear where traditional digital cameras produced none.
* Despite the various intelligent features, color balance was off (e.g. whites were not white).
* Its easier to take blurry pictures with the Lumix than with other cameras shes used.
* The main mode knob has only three modes, but within each mode there are submodes that one has to cycle through using menu buttons.  She found that  difficult to get used to.

She was upgrading from a Canon S50 which shes used since 2004.  She bought the Lumix to specifically replace her S50 for indoor photos.</Content>

<Content>I anxiously watched the mail each day waiting for my order...it was only one day beyond the expected delivery. This is a terrific camera! I have shown it to many of my coworkers and they are wowwed. Even our IT guy says he has to get one of these and recommended that our business purchase one for on-the-job use. Beautiful crisp pictures, ease of operation, and best price I found was through Amazon, which included free shipping and a free 4GB card. I also purchased a 16GB card and reader with the camera for $34, which ensures I dont run short of memory. </Content>

<Content>Been using this camera for about a month and have taken 500-600 pictures and this camera is just great.

What I like:
The Intelligent Automatic mode gets the scene mode right 9 out of 10 times, face detection focus seems to work very well.  Many scene modes to chose from, my favorite being hi-speed.  Its able to take 3-4 frames a second at 2.5megapixels.  The dial on top is clean and simple, the best part being 2 scene modes that I can hot-dial to.  Image quality and color is very good on this camera.  It also feels very well constructed.

What I dislike:
The camera lacks the fine tuning of manual modes, which I would have really liked.  The mic is in a bad spot for video, easily covered by your finger while holding the camera.  The door that covers the ports is a cheap plastic and opens very easily if you bump it.  

Overall I would buy this camera again and recommend it to others.</Content>

<Content>Im not one to write a lot of product reviews, but this one compels me to do so. Ive been using digital cameras for a long time, and in the past have stuck with another brand (which I wont name because I dont want to convey that theyre inferior - theyre also very good, just not like this one, and may well be ideal for someone else). I got the DMC-TZ5 last month, shot a few images around campus, then took it off to San Francisco for a week.

To put it simply, I am blown away by the handling and image quality. You can read elsewhere about the outstanding Leica lens, the good build quality and materials, and I havent taken it apart or put it on the test bench so I wont add to that discussion. But Im a pretty demanding photographer, and this camera makes me very happy.

I took street grab shots all over the city and found the camera very responsive. The LCD worked fine for me in all lighting conditions, and I found it quite easy to compose and shoot. The most needed controls are easily accessible - white balance, exposure compensation, picture modes - and the menus and default settings are easy to work with to get the camera configured just the way you want. The ability to select different color profiles is especially nice. The grip and general configuration work well - I have fairly large hands and have no problem with this relatively small camera. The lens does take a moment to crank out or in when you turn the camera on or off but thats to be expected with a 10X zoom.

Flash photos worked fine, although like any small camera the flash reach is limited, but where it really blew me away was in taking image-stabilized low-light photos. I shot nighttime street scenes, lit by store signs and street lights only, and the images are sharp and crisp at ISO 800. No, I havent printed them, but looking onscreen at full resolution theyre better than any others Ive seen. Im sure one can get better from a D-SLR but Im not willing to carry around that much camera equipment anymore - I want a camera that will always be with me and can still take excellent photos, and this fits the bill better than I had imagined.

I havent used the video function so cant speak to that. Image uploading isnt exactly fast but I think thats a function of the high resolution and corresponding large files rather than some kind of electronic limitation. I like the blue color finish on the body even.

I see surprisingly little barrel distortion at the wide end of the zoom, and being able to go from 28-280mm equivalent is wonderful. And at the long end the image stabilization really does work. Well. Even in low light.

In sum, I love this camera!</Content>

<Content>The Panasonic Lumix DMC TZ5 with 10X optical zoom was purchased in May 2008 from Amazon to replace my outdated 6 year old 4.1 Megapixel Canon Elph.  This review is based upon 6 MONTHS of use.

I wanted more than the 3X from conventional compact digital cameras.  After traveling to places such as India, Portugal, and Cancun, for example, 3X is not versatile enough to capture some of the landscapes, landmarks and distant subjects that I wanted to capture.

To be honest, resolution was not a factor in purchasing a camera but with 9.1 Megapixels, this camera was more than adequate for my purposes since I only print 4x6 photographs.

OPERATION:

This camera is great as a point and shoot camera.  Shutter lag is reasonable for a camera of this class, unlike others I experimented with before buying this one.

FEATURES

Battery life indicator:  You may take this feature for granted but my prior camera (Canon Digital Elph), did not have a battery life indicator.  When traveling, battery life is a very important factor so that you dont miss shots.  I bought 2 spare batteries with my camera.

The 27 megabytes of internal memory is inadequate for any practical purpose allowing for only about 8-10 photos at high resolution or a few seconds of video. 

This camera has a user friendly menu system that is easy to navigate given the 4 directional buttons and central menu/enter button.  There are two scene modes, Intelligent automatic mode, movie mode, clipboard mode and custom mode.  A quick menu button is great for on-the-fly adjustments.

The intelligent auto-mode is where I keep the camera, for a majority of photographs keeping the operation simple - this is the point and shoot mode for a majority of casual users, like myself.   On this mode, picture size (9 MP, 5MP, 3MP and 0.3 MP), aspect ratio (4:3, 3:2, and 16:9), burst mode,  and color mode (standard, natural, vivid, black/white and sepia), can be toggled in the menu.

The custom mode allows me to change other factors such as ISO, continuous auto focus, metering mode, white balance, audio recording, and intelligent exposure, to name a few.  

The glass LCD has various modes to allow you to see the settings, a 9 segmented partition and no data.  I like seeing a histogram in real time to determine the color range of the photograph.

The auto-focus mode has face detection, 3 area high speed, 1 area high speed, spot, 1 area, and 9 area.  I personally keep it in face detection unless I am taking a photo of a landmark or other outdoor subject.

Movie mode is versatile and I use this as a back up camcorder for times when I want to take a quick video.  However, due to the small microphone, the sound quality is not optimal for say, a piano recital or speech where sound is essential.  The picture quality is excellent.  The aspect ratio (4:3, 16:9), picture mode (30 fps/16:9 high or low quality 15 fps/16:9 high or low quality), white balance, metering mode and auto-focus mode can be adjusted.

QUALITY

Picture quality is excellent for the purposes of casual use (i.e. parties, performances, events, stills, pets, children, outdoors.  Zoom photographs is limited by low light given the built in flash.

Movie mode is a versatile feature since it records in high definition 720p.   The video format is in Quicktime mode.  Image quality is limited by low light.

CONSTRUCTION:

The body is made of metal and has a nice heavier weight that allows me to hold it steady.  The textured grip in the front allows me to operate the camera one handed.  

A toggle switch allows the user to take photos or view the photos.  This is a convenient and well thought out feature since cumbersome menus (or even multifunctioned buttons) on other cameras make this reviewer/user confused.  This camera, once you understand what button to use doesnt require the user/operator to have to look at all of the buttons to operate it.

There are 3 output ports, including AV out/digital, component out and DC in.  The battery cover is easy to open and close.  The small Lithium battery and SD card fit in the same compartment.  In the past 6 months of heavy use, I have not had problems with getting the battery or card out.

There is an eccentrically placed port to allow mounting on a tripod.  The location is not useful for handheld tripods but works for conventional full featured tripods.

PROS

Image quality
10X zoom for a compact camera
720p HD quality movies
Solid construction 
Vivid glass LCD screen
Menu system and 5 button navigation
Excellent battery life
Battery life indicator

CONS
Poor sound quality with video
Low light limitations with zoom and video
Wheel selection feature turns 360 degrees (needs to be locked to operate)
Slightly heavier than its compact counterparts 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

If you want to use this camera for HD video, I highly recommend SDHC memory cards.  I purchased 2 Transcend SDHC cards with this camera:

Transcend 8 GB SDHC SD Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6E [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]

The biggest pitfall I found (since I do not use the USB connection to upload to my computer) is transferring my photos using a USB card reader.  The high capacity SD cards, SDHC, are recognized by the card reader.  I bought the following reader since it can read my SDHC card and my old memory cards:

15-1 USB 2 (XD CAPABLE)

Instead of the Panasonic battery, the follow battery, I purchased, is a more economical alternative for a mere fraction of the cost of the original OEM:

Li-Ion Battery for Panasonic CGA-S007 / CGR-S007

VERDICT

For the low price, versatility for a compact point and shoot, this camera goes above and beyond for its price point and is an excellent value.

Two thumbs up.

UPDATE:

I took a snowmobiling trip in Utah and the camera worked well in the freezing temperatures (temperatures were in the low teens and single digits) without a problem.  I was able to take some breathtaking photos of the snow-capped mountain ranges and my family.  The LCD worked flawlessly.  In addition, the motion picture capture also worked well. </Content>

<Content>Im very happy with this camera. My goal was to have a camera that would take nice still photos, along with decent video. It has been everything I expected based on other professional reviews I had read.

For me, there was a small learning curve to get the video focused the way I wanted. Ive learned to frame the shot, focus, and then shoot video, without the continuous focus running. Because the video is 720p, and the camera is so small compared to a camcorder, handheld video is more likely to be a little shaky. Ive learned to be a little more diligent about the way I hold the camera, and I also take advantage of the Image Stabilization feature. Compared to the video from my last mini-dv camcorder, the video is beautiful. For home videos, it is more than adequate. The audio is lower quality, which I expected based on other reviews, but I can hear peoples voices and understand what they are saying, so I am fine with it.

The photos are great for a point-and-shoot. I would definitely recommend following other peoples advice Ive read, which is to keep the INTELLIGENT-ISO mode at a max of 800 to help reduce the grainy look. There are a LOT of features, and I havent learned them all yet. But for the amateur photographer, it would appear that there are numerous options to help you get a great picture.

Ive taken this camera on a couple of one-day trips, and it has been wonderful. Having one relatively small camera that is capable of shooting great photos and video is one of the best accessories a father of three could have. Ive not had any battery issues yet. I like having a rechargeable Lithium-ion  battery. I just charge it up the night before any event, and it always gets me through the next day.

Some more notes about the video as a semi-professional videographer:
A great thing for me has been that the video is in a QuickTime format that is native to my Mac (Motion JPEG). I have been able to create a preset in Final Cut Pro that allows me to work with the video in its native format, without any transcoding. To me, thats a big plus compared to using some of the other HD camcorders out there. Something that needs to be considered, though, is that you need plenty of hard-drive space to store these videos. I bought an A-DATA 16GB Turbo SDHC Class 6 Memory Card here on Amazon to use in this camera. I was a little leery considering it only cost $30 bucks, but it has worked fine so far. Again, I took another persons advice, and Ive left the card in the camera ever since I put it in. I only transfer the photos and video by plugging the camera into the computer. I figure I dont want to mess with the physical integrity of the memory card any more than I have to. Playback of the video is also something that needs to be considered. You can plug the camera into a standard TV for standard resolution playback, or you can buy an extra Component Cable, which Im sure would yield better results for playback on an HDTV. However, when you take the files off of your memory card, youll need to have another playback option. Personally, I plan on using a Mac Mini, with the built-in Front Row software, connected to an HDTV for my future viewing. But for now, the only way to watch my home video in full HD is on my laptop.

Overall, I think another reviewer here put it best when he wrote, If you know what youre getting into, youll be thrilled. Its a great option for a very portable, high quality still-photo and video camera... possibly the best in its category so far.</Content>

Im in love with this camera.  It is small in size with a large LCD screen.  Its nice to really see the picture you want to take.  Menu screens are simple,straightforward and uncomplicated to access and use.   Other controls are easily manipulated.  Its very simple to delete a photo. 

The photos that this camera takes are fabulous.  Very sharp and clear...color is wonderful.  The lense is extraordinary.  My only very small regret is the zoom isnt as good as on my Canon.  Its okay but not great.  

Id highly recommend this camera for the beginner or intermediate user.  Also for those who are baffled by technology.  This is camera is very user friendly.

5 stars for this Panasonic.

<Content>Ive had this product about a month. The only complaint thus far regarding the picture quality is sometimes the flash is too bright, but by the second picture its adjusted perfectly. The colors and density of the images from this camera are amazing. The smart face and antishake technology really puts this unit over the top. The LCD display is phenomenal as well, incredibly detailed. 
  The surprise based on what Ive read here is how great the video quality at 720P 30 FPS is. It creates a .MOV file; Im using premiere elements to convert it to an .MPeg file to stream to a PS3 and ultimately to a 60 Elite Plasma and a 110 1080P projector. The image quality is very good and definitely high def. Ive got a HDV Sony HC-1 camcorder that records at 1080i and the TZ5s image quality is very good in comparison. Ive owned a JVC HD1 720P 30fps HDV camcorder and I find the image quality of the TZ5 much better (I still have footage from the HD1 to compare). The video quality was much better than any DV camcorder that Ive seen. If the audio were higher quality (the audio is mono and very compressed) and the record time more than 8 minutes this unit would be a great camcorder substitute.
 I am recommending the heck out of this camcorder to friends and colleagues. I absolutely love it.

<Content>ebeowulf - I guess you reviewed a wrong camera!!! (LOL) not TZ5. Please see my comments to each of the issues you have pointed out and given this camera a miserly 1. There are 179 5 star comments to 7 1 star comments (less than 4%) in this site. So majority reviewers cannot be wrong. Again, we are not having SLR quality or low light performance when reviewing a PS please.

Problems: 
1) Buttons are awkwardly located, making it easy to accidentally press the wrong button. 

There is only 1 dial that is out of way from fingers when you use. Other than that it is the shutter and zoom ring combo. there is a e.zoom button that is very tiny. The power switch and play/camera switch are physical toggle switch, that simply by press of a finger cannot be changed!!! What buttons are you talking about?
2) Power options for extending battery life are non-existent - the camera simply runs until it dies (without much advance notice). Please see the above comments to switch of LCD dear or read the manual beofre you write reviews.
3) On-camera menus are not intuitive. 
It is one of the easiest menu systems I have come acrros in cameras. The quick menu is a childs play and icon based. A nitwit can understand this easily.
4) Movies are in the quicktime format - nothing plays quicktime except intrusive Apple software. 
Agreed...Phew...
5) Pictures are NOT auto-rotated in windows. You have to use panasonics special software, or otherwise rotate all pictures by hand. 
Worng again...they are auto-rotated. Not the gyro types, but vertical pictures are display vertically but the camera in horizontal position
6) Tech support is snotty and unhelpful. 
I have no experince of this...</Content>

<Content>This a second TZ5 I have.  I bought a first one (blue) in April of this year and used it for two weeks before my wife dropped it on a plush carpet and it immediately showed lens error.  I was very disappointed and I previously was very disappointed in TZ3 low light photos, so I decided not to bother with Panasonic TZ5.  However, I decided to try my luck again, after I collected a bunch of gift cards and needed to buy something.  This time I got a silver model.  I just took them to Madonna concert and I was very very pleased with results. 

1) I did buy two additional extended life batteries on ebay 1400mA each. The original one is 1000mah.   I got used to my Fuji F30 doing 500-600 shots per charge with no problems, so I am spoiled and wanted fresh batteries.   However, I did not need them at the concert.   I took about 370 photographs and 5 videos about 5 minute length, and my TZ still shows two bars! I did not use flash but I did do a lot of zooming and reviewing.  Looks like I will be able to squeeze 400+ photos on the original battery which is superb!

2) Ability to set a minimum shutter speed is priceless for application such as a concert where you need to zoom all the way.   I just selected 1/60 minimum shutter speed, Auto ISO, H focus and I got some great shots with these.   If I did not have the minimum shutter speed, I would have not been able to take pictures that I did at the concert.

3) Display is very nice

4) True wide angle (not just crops the frame)

5) extended optical zoom

6) auto red eye removal

7) ISO 400 is now useful!!!

What can I wish for?  I guess 12-14X zoom instead of 10X zoom and little optical viewfinder.  Shutter and Aperture Priority.</Content>

<Content>This camera was about as close to what I was looking for as there is on the market (good picture quality and decent HD wide screen video in a small point and shoot), but ultimately the VERY poor sound quality during video play back was the deal breaker. Sorry Panasonic - I really liked this product, but you need to know that this one issue blew it! I agree with all of the other reviews regarding positive attributes. I liked the video quality, but when I played back on my HDTV, through good speakers - how terrible. 

To be honest - the sound quality is so bad, I could not even enjoy any video at all and my family actually made fun of my technology for the first time! How demoralizing! 

I do have a suggestion however, try out the new Sony T500. Its great - pretty good pictures (TZ5 is a bit better in this regard), but the Sony Video, WOW!!! Really good, with great stereo sound quality!!!! So the TZ5 went back and the T500 is my new camera/camcorder!</Content>

<Content>I just got the TZ5 last week for my wife. Have been playing with it for a almost a week now. I must say Im quite happy with it. The reviews by most other users have been quite helpful (and quite accurate!) =) 

What I like:
- 10x zoom in such a small body!
- large 3 inch screen thats got a really sharp display. Beautiful!
- Quick menu button. Comes in quite handy
- quite decent battery life.

What I dont like as much:
- movie taking is not as great as imagined. Focussing can be really slow when you zoom during movie-taking
- lack of some manual controls (on exposure, speed etc.)
- not standard USB port connector on the side of the camera (so youll need to have the proprietery USB cable)

Overall, Im quite please with this purchase. And I think my wife will like it too!

<Content>Had this camera for a few days now.  I normally shoot with a Nikon D300 and wanted something I could stick in my pocket and that also took 720p video.  

So far I can say that this little guy takes really decent pictures.  Colors are good, auto white balance seems pretty accurate thus far, and the 720p videos look pretty good considering they are coming from a device that small.  There are lots of modes for all sorts of shooting situations and lots of settings that you can tweak if you so desire.  If not, just point and shoot.  The 10x zoom is very nice, too.

The one issue I have with it so far is that the camera captures a LOT of noise when zooming or focusing while taking a video.  Kind of annoying during playback of the videos.  

Other than that, this camera is a great buy.  I bought for $230.  For all that you get, the price cant be beat.  </Content>

<Content>As a DSLR owner, I was searching for a more compact camera to carry with me. This little jewel is almost a perfect fit for my needs. A high quality Leica lens with the highest zoom ratio in its class renders sparkling images, better in some respects than my Canon EOS XSi. Its 3 inch monitor is large and bright. I would have liked to have an optical viewfinder on bright sunny days when it is hard to see the monitor. 23 different scene modes to choose from, including a fireworks mode, is the largest I have seen on a Point and Shoot. The flash is adequate for close shots within its limited range. The camera takes HD moving pictures, but I havent tried that feature yet. The slide show is kind of cool, and it even plays sounds and allows effects. The included software is rudimentary, and you may want to use something more powerful.
All this is a tiny package with a reasonable price tag.</Content>

<Content>I have traded in my digital SLR a long time ago and first purchased the TZ3 by Panasonic. The bust purchase I have ever made in the camera department. All was well till I dropped it into the river.

Replaced it with the TZ5 and find it is just as great if not better than the TZ3.

If you want a great camera that will do most anything you ask of it the TZ5 is for you. So trade in that big camera bag for the TZ5 powerhouse and put it in your pocket and get ready for some great images to come your way. The 10X optical zoom put eyery shot withing your reach and all I can say is that the SLR people can do not more but carry a heavy load.

They should give the TZ5 a look and I bet a lot would purchase one.

The pricing I got on Amazon was great also and the transaction went off without a hitch.

<Content>The TZ5K is a terrific camera if you like a good zoom.  The 10X goes on out to 16.9X with the digital added in.  The images are sharp and the response time is acceptable for a point and shoot.  Weight and size are good for pocket carrying and the on/off switch is a real plus.  You can put this camera into action very quickly.

The field of view is very good and quickly brought in with the great zoom.  It is easy to use in a small room for family photos, getting a wide field.

The image stabilization is excellent for sports and family use.

Cons:  I miss a view finder even though this camera has an excellent LCD display, it is a bit hard to see in bright sun.  

Battery:  Life is OK even with Force Flash activated for each photo.  I have shot over 100 frames with the flash with power to spare.  I would much rather have AA batteries.  This takes a special size battery and of course a different charger.  I recommend one carry a spare battery and leave another on the charger.  I use three and get along fine charging all at night.  The supplied charger and the accessory charger I bought seem to refresh the batteries rapidly.  I have not timed the recharge, but it would appear less than 4 hours?

Would I buy it again and recommend it?  Yes, for my use I would but for general family use the user needs to understand a bit about photography to get the best results.  The photos have a high byte count but it is easily reduced for email, etc. with the software supplied with the camera.

The camera ia rugged and seems well constructed.  The lens is a work of art, wonderful.   </Content>

<Content>Received the camera from AMAZON, loved the price, after pretty good comparative shopping, but the best is the camera itself. LUMIX TZ5 has a hard to find 10x optical zoom, for small digitals, optical stabilization - already seen excellent improvement over my previous Canon 550, in identical conditions. TO top it off, the TZ5 comes with one of the widest wide angles in the market for a digital point and shoot. The choices for programmable preselections are endless and very helpful. Battery life is OK. The user interface is OK, not sure if it is my learning curve as I have been a long time CANON user and I need time to adjust, or whether it is just a bit more complicated. Anyway, I am willing to spend more time in the user interface given the better overall quality and options I am getting. Sticking with the 5 stars, even though the AMAZON service and price demand their own separate 5 stars. NOTE: I ordered the camera with a next day delivery. It arrived 3 days later due to a shipping mix up, but AMAZON refunded me immediately all the shipping charges. I guess bad things happen, but the good response has to be there to make everything better.</Content>

Anyway, im Incredibly pleased with this camera...i was even able to zoom in far while someone was running around, take the pic almost instantly, and there was no blur with the flailing of his arms and legs. good stuff.</Content>

<Content>The Panasonic DMC-TZ5 is exactly the camera I was looking for.  I can put in a pocket or purse and go. We just took it on a trip to Yosemite. It was very easy to use and the pictures are great!  The 10x zoom is fantastic!  I got a really good picture of the city of San Francisco -- from across the bay!!  The image stabilization worked beautifully.  We were on a tour boat in the bay in very choppy waters but you cant tell it at all from the photos of the Golden Gate.

Yes, it does have some purple fringing and it will tend to blow out highlights but for what it is I think it does a very good job and would highly recommend it.  I gave it 4 stars just because of the fringing issue.</Content>

<Summary>Fabulous Point  Shoot</Summary>
</Review>
<Review>
<DocID>B0011Z44UA-202</DocID>
<Content>I wanted a compact camera with a good range zoom, hd video mode, great manual controls (with a good auto mode)  a larger LCD - and of course great photo capabilities.

Well, a camera like that just doesnt exist at the time of this review. The TZ5 is what I would consider the closest thing without breaking the budget.

I have used it for a few weeks, nearly non stop...here is my breakdown in order of most importance.

PROS --

1. the 10x Zoom is fabulous, especially with a camera this size. not to mention that it has great stabilization (the best Ive ever seen) , great for video mode and low light conditions.
2. the intelligent Auto mode really does work well. the exposure, flash intensity  auto focus are consistently good in most all pictures (not as great in low light though, but still better than anything else under $300)
3. the LCD will make you completely forget there is no viewfinder (I rarely used one anyway) - its so large and sharp, you really can see detail well.
4. best picture quality of any point  shoot I have used.
5. can zoom in and out  auto focus while in video mode
6. low light auto focus - this is very good as long as you arent zoomed in and the subject is 4ft or so away. because of the infrared beam, it will consistently focus well even in near absolute darkness.
7. Accessories are cheap (an extra battery is only $8, and a good fitted hard case only $15)
8. $$$ - the price is sooo good right now, there really isnt anything that can compare to this cameras features (as long as those features are what youre looking for)


CONS - (if these are important to you, you might want to consider waiting for something else)

1. Video mode (audio) - this is absolutely the biggest downfall of the camera. to start things off the mic is in a stupid spot, and if you arent covering it with your left index finger, there still is no shot of getting decent audio.  ------- the audio sounds tin-like and full of background noise. its also extremely muffled, so much so that it can be hard to tell what people are saying unless they are loud or really close. most everyone sounds like they have a mild lisp. (in ideal conditions, the sound is ok after I boost it with software)

(would it have been too expensive to put a better mic in this camera? I would have paid more for it without thinking twice)

2. Video mode (video) - although it is HD, the quality isnt that fabulous especially at data rates of upto 25mbs - which eats a 2gb sd card up in 8minutes - theres no way I can afford to keep the original files...they have to be converted to h.264 to save hard drive space. - the video also records bright light reflections as a white vertical bar from top to bottom of the video (ie - light from the sun  reflecting off of cars etc.)

3. Few/no manual controls - the manual controls are few and hard to use. I would have really liked manual focus on this camera. It would have given room for a lot more creativity - especially when zoomed in low light conditions, where the camera has a tough time focusing.

4. Zoom noise recorded in Video mode - most of the time a little zoom noise is recorded. while zooming back to 28mm loud clicks are almost always recorded at the very end -  also the zoom speed isnt always smooth)

5. Low-light auto focus (while zoomed in only) - I think that most every compact has an issue with this. this camera is better than most Ive used. It really has a tough time focusing on objects in low light conditions when the camera is zoomed past half way.

6. camera size - the camera is bigger than most point and shoots, it was bigger than I expected, but still fits in a larger pocket. (some compromises have to be made to fit 10x zoom in a camera)



I have much more to say, but I dont think too many people have that kind of time, so hear is a quick conclusion...


If you want a mostly pocketable camera that packs a 10x stabilized zoom, a great auto mode, a bright/large LCD, a zoomable video mode and beautiful pictures (compared to other point  shoots) and have no other requirements...this IS the camera for you...

If you want more manual control, a really good video mode and audio that you can hear without tons of background noise...you would be wise to look elsewhere.

IN SHORT - If you are buying this camera for its HD video - DONT!!!

<Content>My dilemma: I need a camera that I can pocket, or I dont HAVE a camera. But my father is a photographer; if I bring home a less than excellent camera  I will hear of it.
Indefinitely. 

This is the first camera Ive found to be both Excellent and pocketable.

Admittedly Dad isnt going to drop his Minolta, but he bought a TZ5 for my mother. 

The TZ5 inspires envy with its huge screen, effective zoom and compact size.  Depth of field is displayed whenever the zoom is activated.

Two drawbacks: 1 No viewfinder. Only an issue in bright light. 2 A perceptible pause between hitting the shutter and taking the picture. The first is, alas, a price paid for a compact. The second, a real flaw, seems to be the nature of almost all digital cameras.

I bought this camera the week it came out. Be advised the are occasional firmware updates. You will need a SD or SDHC card to do them. They are available at http://panasonic.jp/support/global/cs/dsc/download/TZ4_5/index.html

On 28 October 2008 AD the firmware was version 1.2 They have versions for bith Macintosh and Windows.

Not only would I recommend it, I have.

<Content>We received this camera as a gift, and it seemed a wonderful replacement to our poor, broken Photosmart camera.  Unfortunately, the problems with this camera arent immeadiately apparent.  The problems are deep seated form-factor and software issues that become constant annoyances farther down the road.

Problems:
1) Buttons are awkwardly located, making it easy to accidentally press the wrong button.
2) Power options for extending battery life are non-existent - the camera simply runs until it dies (without much advance notice).
3) On-camera menus are not intuitive.
4) Movies are in the quicktime format - nothing plays quicktime except intrusive Apple software.
5) Pictures are NOT auto-rotated in windows.  You have to use panasonics special software, or otherwise rotate all pictures by hand.
6) Tech support is snotty and unhelpful.

The first problem we noticed with the camera was the awkward positioning of buttons and dials.  Both of us are always pressing the wrong button by accident when trying to take a picture.  With the menu and navigation buttons right next to where you place your thumb, it is easy to accidentally enable some random feature that we wouldnt otherwise ever use.  For me, this problem is especially apparent when taking vertical pictures.

The second problem is the lack of power save options.  When travelling, a power plug is not always available, so it is convenient to turn off power hungry features such as the display when you dont need them.  Although the battery does last a long time, and the power problem could be rectified by plugging the camera in every night, it is easy to forget.  With our previous camera, we could disable the screen when we had forgotten to plug in the camera so we could still take pictures all day on low power.  This camera, however, doesnt have that option.  Furthermore, it doesnt alert somebody to its lack of power until it has maybe 10 minutes remaining... and then off it goes (at noon on the most picturesque day of the trip).

The third problem is a minor annoyance.  We are always struggling to find the right options in the menu.  Maybe the features are there, or maybe they arent... but the menus are crazy.

The fourth problem has to do with Panasonics use of the Quicktime movie format.  We really wanted a new camera so that we could take movies of our 1-year daughter.  Unfortunately, all of the cute movies weve recorded are only viewable in Apples Quicktime.  They arent convertable to any other viewer either.  I dont know about other peoples experience with Quicktime, but it either crashes my computer outright or hogs processing and network time, preventing other software from running.  The result is that we cant watch all of these cute movies weve recorded.

The fifth problem is the auto-rotate feature.  The camera has an auto-rotate, right?  It is advertised as having one.... too bad they dont use it to rotate the pictures.  Instead, they set some software bit in each image that is only readable by the panasonic software.  If I want to show pictures to a friend, I have to either rotate everything by hand in windows beforehand, or try to navigate panasonics clunky, poorly designed software.

Finally, the last problem is with the panasonic tech support.  Ive contacted them three times, and only received an answer once.  And that one time (in reference to the Quicktime problems), they simply told me tough... rather than trying to help me work around the issue, or giving me any contact info from apple or...

The DMC-TZ5 camera seems ok at first glance, but the design and software issues associated with with the camera make the experience overwhelmingly negative in the long run.  We will most likely be buying a new camera.</Content>

Although the pictures are not at par with Canons quality, Lumix makes it up with a good design, multiple features and equipped with the Leica lens. The 10X zoom is a big plus considering that I usually like to zoom in on the subjects. I highly recommend this camera.</Content>

Auto-focus is fast and allowed me to take clear pictures in an airshow. The low-light performance is not the best (e.g. grainy for anything above ISO100) , but I didnt expect very much in low-light for this type of camera. Overall great value for the price.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera prior to a western states vacation and it performed extremely well!  We took over 1200 pictures that all turned out very well.  There are several easy options for taking photos, and we used several that produced outstanding results from scenery, to sports and a special star gazing setting.  One of the most surprising features was the incredible power of the zoom.  It actually magnifies to 64x and enabled several incredible pictures.  We could barely see specs climbing cliffs in Zion National Park, and with the zoom were able to capture views up close of two climbers.  The Colorado River rapids were visible from the North Rim of the Grand Canyon-- a site some others with 10x binoculars could not see, let alone capture.  This camera is compact, has good battery life, easily fits in a pocket, and enables incredible shots with the zoom.  It is our 3rd digital camera, the least expensive, and most powerful and capable.  It lives up to Digital Photography highest rating in every way! </Content>

Everyone is impressed with the pictures it takes.  My only complaint is the video capturing....if you move the video too quickly or if you are in sunny/bright lighting you will see bands across the video.  I dont care too much since I bought camera for its picture quality anyway.  Definitely recommend this to everyone. </Content>

<Content>Ive had this camera for about 2 weeks now.  I bought it as a replacement for an older model Kodak digital camera.  While not the most compact of cameras, it still is small enough to fit into a pocket and easily carry.  The large view screen and 10x zoom were the most attractive features to me and they have proven invaluable.  Ive taken pictures in several modes including scenery, night scenery, portrait and self-portrait and all seem to be excellent.  Uploading pictures to my computer is a snap.  I cant wait to see what else this camera can do.</Content>

<Content>Great all around camera. The IQ is generally good, but allow me to clear two things up. The camera doesnt do too well in indoor low light situations, and the video is sub-par with terrible mono audio. Aside from this, the excellent 28mm to 10x zoom is very useful in many situations, and the panasonic camera is unmatched at this time in this regard. Overall im glad of the purchase I made for an all-around camera, and highly recommend it! </Content>

<Content>I had previously owned a TZ3 , then I upgraded to TZ5 for the HD video recording capability with zoom. Overall the camera performs well. I like the new intelligent auto mode which is handy. The zoom is not fast enough like a camcorder also the focus is not fast enough but having said that I enjoy recording family videos. Overall good value for money. There is nothing to complain about the build quality. The on screen menu interface is pleasant to use.</Content>

<Content>With 40 years of experience in photography,I know what I like in a camera.
I use a DSLR by choice, but I try to carry a camera on me all the time. I have done so since the 70s, digital, since 98. My new Lumix is wonderful!
Small enough to carry in a belt pouch without banging into everything, (less than an 1-1/2 wide) yet extending to 10x optical zoom when powered up. Carrying the camera everywhere allows me to document findings to share with my employer. The image quality is outstanding even at the smallest resolution. The .3mp 640x480 is particularly useful for getting pix emailed in hurry. The 9mp resolution allows for substantial cropping. Battery life is substantial and aftermarket batteries are available cheap!(2for $10) I have yet to explore the many of scene selections and shooting variations, yet in six weeks, have found no aspect of this camera I did not like. </Content>

But I ended up returning both the TZ5  the SD870is.  The f100fd has the brightest indoor images of all, and thats the most important feature I look for.  The SD870is indoor image is a little bit brighter than the TZ5, but still behind the Fuji.  If youre really into higher-quality video  longer zoom, go for the TZ5.</Content>

The colors are very good and there are a remarkable number of settting to chose from (and learn.) Ive used Nikon and Cannon equivalents the Panasonic more than holds its own by comparison. Ive even been able to show my 88 yr. old mother how to operate it - the only problem being getting it back!

<Content>I bought this camera for a vacation trip -- I wanted a camera that was easy to use but capable of close-ups (which is why I wanted a 10x zoom). So far, about a month later, Im very happy with it -- it takes excellent shots, has been quite easy to learn to use, and is turning out to be rugged as well. (I fell while trying to photograph a hawk, and while I sprained my ankle, the camera was unharmed...)

There has been at least one instance where the automatic settings didnt work, but I was able to find a Scene Mode that worked quite well. I had bought an extra battery, but never needed to use it; battery life was sufficient to take me through a full day of sightseeing, including a couple of short videos, and I never got a low power notice.

The sound on the videos isnt great outdoors (but you cant really expect good sound without some kind of windscreen), and its a bit weighty for a compact camera. But all in all, Ive found it an excellent buy thus far.</Content>

This is a very versatile  camera. It has many of the technical aspects of a good 35mm. The leica lens, tremendous zoom, and the ability to print enlarged pictures with almost no loss of resolution are great features. I recently used the burst mode to take some golf pictures with hilarious results. Although I havent used that feature, it can be used as a video camera. Light weight, simple to use and not too expensive.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera a last week and it arrived the morning before I left for New York City for a friends wedding. I really didnt have a chance to play around with the camera, so most of the pictures were shot with normal mode or intelligent auto. The pictures turned out beyond horrible. Out of the 500+ pictures that I took on the trip, there were only about 50 that I would say were good quality. When I uploaded them to the camera, I deleted over 300 of the pictures on my first pass because they were so bad. The pictures from the wedding were disgraceful and there were only a handful that were acceptable. Most had a ton of blur or a red tint to the pictures. Almost every dance floor picture had people that were so blurred that they looked invisible in certain spots.

Heres an example of nearly every picture I took...

<Content>I have only started using this camera, but I really like it so far. Its small enough to fit in my pocket (or be carried around with one hand) and versatile enough to take pictures of anything within reason. The 10x zoom is quite powerful and the intelligent auto mode is usually sufficient (though not always -- it seems to have something against white and red flowers).

The battery is better than the impression youd get from the manual, particularly since the camera manages to take good pictures without flash even when its getting dark. Also, the interaction with the computer is completely painless: unlike my old camera which involved installing its own software, this one works like a USB disk.

I am not an expert on cameras so I wont even try to go into the details. However, the TZ5 has done almost everything Ive tried to make it do so far and Im very satisfied with it.</Content>

<Content>I have been looking for a point and shoot camera that would take decent pictures of my daughters volleyball games inside a fairly well lit high school gym. My Canon SD750 failed miserably. Before purchasing my TZ5, I read up all the stuff about sensors and ISO settings and it seemed Sony had the best technology. Nope. It went back the same day. Tried a Kodak, it lasted fifteen minutes! The Olympus Stylus 1010 was useless in both the gym and a restaurant.

Finally I ponied up $300 and bought the TZ5. It cant take a decent shot in the gym of anything over eight feet away! Every picture is either filled with noise or blurry. Trying to use the zoom, anyone across the gym is unrecognizable.

I am beginning to wonder if I need to buy a D-SLR with an external flash.
Pretty sad.

The Panasonic Lumix TZ5 does not deliver. My wifes Canon SD400 takes as good of a picture if not better in most lighting situations. Great features, poor pictures.

I have had digital cameras for about ten years now and never saw such poor quality as the recent ones.</Content>

I have had a point and shoot digital camera for years, and the Panasonic DMC-TX5 is the best I have ever used. It is my always with me camera. I also have an Olympus E500 DSLR that I use for special occasions. I was attracted to the TX5 because of the zoom capabilities, and I have not been disappointed. I would say the Olympus takes better pictures, but it is bigger, heavier, and definitely not a camera I want to lug with me everywhere. The high resolution and zoom capabilities, coupled with the price, make the TX5 a great value.</Content>

<Content>Hmmm, since I have a Cannon, I guess that pretty much says something.  Panasonic Lumix is not bad, I really like how it adjusts everything for you in a way that this is almost like a dummy-can-use camera.  Really user-friendly.  But since I need more freedom to adjust for shutter speed, flash, aperture...etc, this easy-to-use cameras features all of a sudden become an obstacle.

So if youre not a Canon user, thats great!  This is a good start-up for new comers.  If you are, I guess theres no need to buy this one.</Content>

<Content>The main reason for getting a camera with a 10x zoom is to take pictures of birds and wildlife from faraway.  Often when you see that lovely bird you only have 3 seconds until she turns and flys away.  So its really critical that everything about the camera aid to getting the perfect shot quickly.
I found everything about the TZ5 to be slow.  Power on 2 secs, Power off 1.5 secs.  Power on, zoom to 10x, focus, shoot about 8 seconds.  Time between photos 2 seconds, time between flash photos 6 seconds.
On the top is an options ring to select photo, video, or special photo modes.  If you are storing the camera in your pocket, its easy for this ring to turn.  So next time you turn the camera on and are ready to photgraph that perfect eagle with winds spread, and just get the message, dial is in wrong position.  A similar problem occurs with the record/playback switch.  If you forgot to leave the camera in record mode, there is another 10 seconds while our beautiful eagle is flying away.
Yes i recently went on a trip, and i saw a lot of beautiful birds, but i missed literally 60% of the good shots due to these design issues.
An SLR camera such as the Canon Digital Rebel EOS would be good for getting fast response.
Another point is that this camera has an externally telescoping lens.  This is a big reason for the delays in powering up and down as the lens has to pop out and in each time, which also consumes significant battery power.  My previous camera, Sony Cybershot DSCT300, had a fully internal lens system, and it could take the first picture in 1 second.  On our tourbus we went sandboarding and everyone got covered with sand, and sand in all the pockets.  Almost everyperson who had an external lens (including my tz5) had malfunctions with the lens system after.  So dont take a camera with a externally telescoping lens to the beach, unless you are prepared to be super carefull.

<Content>I am no expert at photography and bought this camera for use primarily while traveling.  We chose this camera because of the wide angle lens and the 10x zoom.  We travel frequently and photograph a lot of buildings and often use the zoom to capture scenes from a distance or from behind a crowd of people.  We are extremely satisfied with the quality of the pictures.  The intelligent picture setting is sometimes less than ideal, but the other options seem to compensate well in those situations without requiring fine-tune adjustments.  I often take photos with the flash disabled and the camera is able to capture pictures in low light that are not excessively dark or blurry.  I originally looked for a camera with an optical view finder, but Im not missing it.  The battery life is more than adequate even using the display and so far there has been enough light to allow for proper aiming.</Content>

<Content>I am impressed and at times, amazed by the quality and value packed into this camera.   I think it is generally intuitive to use but the users manual is good for resolving features I am not familiar with.  There is also an excellent Youtube video by CameraLabs to get you started.  The Zoom is quite good, the lense and image quality is good, the Optical Image Stabilization is very good.   The only think I can complain about is that the camera fools around a bit trying to focus with larger Optical Zoom settings.   This is frustrating for action shots.  I have learned to focus before action happens but sometimes that means leaving the camera on for long periods of time between shots.  Still, this is far and away the best of the 6 digitals I have owned in the last several years and I am quite happy with it.</Content>

<Content>Ive always been a fan of superzoom cameras. Ive owned a Panasonic FZ1 and a Canon S3 IS. Theyve been wonderful cameras, but their major shortcomings for me have always been their size. They tended to be large enough to stop me from carrying them. 
The best camera for the job is the one you have with you. 
The TZ4 fits in a pocket, albeit a larger pocket; preferably a cargo pocket. My camera choice has been influencing my fashion sense as of late. Its on the largish side, but still compact enough to keep with me pretty much all the time. 
Image quality is excellent, and the zoom is excellent. The Leica lenses seem to be a factor, and the automatic modes seem to consistently pick the best settings. The major shortcomings seem to be slow focus in low light, and bad placement of the microphone. 
Over all, Id recommend this camera for someone looking for the most functionality in a small package. Its not for everyone, but I still highly recommend it.

<Content>As other reviewers have stated, I really wanted to love this camera.  I kept it for a year, just to give it a fair chance.  For that year, I compared its pictures to those taken by my 2 Sony point and shoot cameras on automatic mode.  There is no comparison.  Here are the problems with this camera:

1) The brains arent intelligent.  It takes daylight pictures too slow, opting for a broader focal distance.  For example, on auto mode, a picture of a jugler at a fair in full daylight renders the juglers hands and pins blurry.  The pictures are too slow to stop most motion.  In program mode, the only adjustment you can make which will render a faster picture is to increase the ISO.  More to come on that.  

2)  Its autoexposure isnt particularly intelligent either.  It doesnt recogize backlight.  You can manually adjust the exposure compensation if your subject is still available.

3)  The flash produces washed-out, flat, bluish pictures.

4)  Pictures start showing graininess at ISO 200 or below.  They become unacceptable at 400.  So bumping up the ISO to force a faster picture isnt a very good answer.

5)  The flash unit is not in the center of the camera.  I put my fingers over the flash about half of the time. 

I have replaced the camera with a Sony DSC-H50.  It has a lovely zoom and is fully configurable.  It is bigger and not so easy to carry, but rewards me with great pictures nearly every time - even in fully automatic mode.</Content>

<Content>This camera is great! I took it to Yellowstone National Park last week and used this camera to take some great shots. The E-Zoom feature is excellent in being able to quickly zoom in on something like a bear thats 100 yards away. 

Pros:
- The lens range is great as it has a very usable range from 28-280mm and is easy to use
- The timer is rather quick (10 sec) but works well and is easy to activate
- The mode dial is easy to use
- The 3 LCD screen is great, but does get difficult to see in the bright sunshine

Cons:
- The battery is unique and has to be taken out to be recharged, I recommend buying a spare and keeping it with you while using the camera for long periods of time

Overall the camera is an excellent product and I would highly recommend it (even more so after seeing the latest price reduction).</Content>

I know the purists say you should have a dedicated movie camera if you are into shooting home video, but I find a good quality compact digital camera is much easier to carry around and less intimidating to your subjects when youre aiming it at them.  I have a Sony DSC t100 which is an awesome little camera, but it doesnt interface well with my Mac (no audio on movies), and I have to run the footage through Roxio program on my PC to convert to AVi, then copy the AVI files to my Mac.  Tedious and time-consuming.  I find Sonys proprietary memory stick to be annoying as well.  I also wanted to upgrade to a compact digital that shot movies in HD.  I like to use stills from my video footage in my finished IMovies and HD video allows for pretty good stills.  I loved so much about the DMC TZ5, but the it struggled to focus in low light and the  audio for my finished movies was very poor compared to the Sony.  You can really only hear the person shooting the footage clearly (if he/she avoids covering the poorly-located microphone with his/her left index finger), and you miss a lot of the dialogue of the subjects.  This is a huge flaw if youre doing home movies, since some of the best audio comes from side comments and reactions.  I used the camera for a few weeks and did some short films on my Mac, but I just couldnt get past the low volume of the audio track.  The microphone barely picks up audio more than a couple of feet away.  I did extensive research before buying it and did not see this issue mentioned anywhere, so I am afraid I will never know if the audio capabilities are up to my standards without trying the camera out first. The superb audio quality of my Sony may have spoiled me, but I had to send the Lumix back.</Content>

<Content>This is a good hiking field camera with excelent zoom capability.  The Lica lense provides accurate color with little distortion.  I especially like its size and weight along with excellent anti-shake capabilities that allow you to take hand-held long exposures up to 1/4 sec. Only shortcomings are long shutter response for portrait shots and weak flash for strong backlight shots. </Content>

<Content>Great camera. Owned a Canon SD 1000, This camera is alot bigger and a little bit bulky but it has 10 optical zooms which makes it a cool tech item to own. Picture is clear, video is good quality ... Make sure you get a superfast memory SD card or else you can only record for up to a few minutes.         Maybe around 16x or the fastest. I had 8 x and it was not fast enough to record constantly for a few minutes.     Night images are great if you lower the iso and open up the aperture. It will not fit great in your pocket. Too big. </Content>

<Content>Have you ever carried your SLR and additional lens a long way or if you sail like I do carrying that extra weight  about in the cockpit is a real pain and sometimes by the time you have changed your lens ...the subject has gone.  That is now a thing of the past with this little gem of a camera.
  The Venus IV control for this camera is damn good and gets things right about 98% of the time.... the Intelligent control is rarely wrong in its analysis I am happy to say.  I compared my Canon SLR with the 70-200mm lens(non stabilized) on a tripod with the TZ5 on stabilized #1 position and was blown away at how well they compared at approx the same magnitudes....very impressive indeed.
 The two scene set ups allow you to choose from a page and a half of settings for instant action..That has been a blessing.  Also the video I tried at a airshow...truly excellent.
  Negatives  of course...#1) would love an actual view finder for those sunny days where it can be a case of Did I take that !!)   It would be nice if Panasonic came up with a simple cover you could slide in place for those days or even offer it as an extra.  #2 naturally there has to be a shutter delay with this type of camera...sometimes imperceptable, othertimes a little lonnger..just have to remember which setting is best.
 Recommendations:  Buy that small hard case Panasonic designed for this camera then you can dangle it or attach it to your belt like another cell phone but VERY well protected.  Does it fit in your shirt pocket  NO!  but your jacket or trouser pocket  YES.  One of my best buys in a camera for general use.  My other cameras:  Canon SLR Digitals and a Canon Powershot Pro 1 (a much larger point and shoot but with an L lens).  I have never recommended a camera to anyone before but always have read peoples reviews on them....In this case I hope other people will read this and at least go and have a look and hopefully get the same enjoyment that I get.

<Content>Want a small camera that is easy to use but still has a lot of power?  This is it.  It is so simple that you can start using it right out of the box without reading anything.  The menus are  easy to figure out so if you want to supress the flash, no problem.  You can set up the common types of photos you take and switch to those settings just by turnign a knob.  But for 99% of the photos you will want, the auto settings are just fine.  Photos are crisp with great color.  And uploading to your PC is a snap.

The only downside I have found is that the screen sometimes has a blue line across it. </Content>

Software that comes with camera is so-so.  You have to open battery compartment to remove SD card.  Larger thna many of the newer cameras but still reasonable.  Researched cameras extensively before buying and you cant buy a better non-SLR with 10x optical zoom and wide-angle for less.</Content>

<Content>I wanted a camera that was small enough to carry for daily use (and this is), one that had a phenomenal zoom (and this one does), has a good burst feature and is easy to use.

The lag in this camera is beyond frustrating.  For once I wanted a camera that was quick enough so I wouldnt miss the shots I wanted and in this department, the Lumix is no better than any other compact Ive ever owned. The burst feature has severe lag prior to taking the first shot and the lag is awful between shots.  And thats in burst mode!  The lag between shots while not in burst mode is positively disgraceful.  And by the time you are finished changing the settings, the opportunity for the shot you wanted are long gone.

The Lumix is a complete waste of money and time.  For those who want a higher functioning camera, its best to just go out and buy one.  For those who want a compact camera, go get something less expensive because the extra money for the Lumix is a complete waste.  Anyone want to buy a gently used camera?</Content>

I handed the camera to my nephew to take pictures of my sons Eagle Court of Honor.  The camera was set to Intelligent Auto, and my nephew is pretty tech savvy.
The pictures were terrible.  Many were blurred beyond usability.  The color was way off.  The .jpgs are filled with artifacts.
This camera may take better pictures than this under different circumstances, but the intelligent auto setting was terrible for an indoor event in a large hall.
All in all, an extreme disappointment.  I wish I had handed him my Canon Digital Rebel SLR.</Content>

<Content>I assume anyone whos reading this review already has looked at the specs, so I wont regurgitate them.  I did a lot of research and went through a couple of cameras (Fuji F100fd, Cannon SD770IS) before I settled on this one, and Ill explain why I settled on this one above the other two.  My main criteria were:

1. Picture quality
2. Low-light performance
3. Speed (boot up, focus speed, etc.)

I first bought the Fuji F100fd because of its low-light performance.  I found that although low-light performance was good, it wasnt as good as it was hyped up to be.  ISO 400+ pictures were a bit grainy -- much better than my previous Canon SD450, but not near as good as I had expected.  In decent light, the picture quality was superb, the best of any point-and-shoot Ive used.  However, the killer was speed.  The focus and time-to-shoot was too slow, and by the time it actually took the picture the moment was gone most of the times.  So this wasnt working for me.

Having owned two Canon Powershots before, I knew what I was getting when I swapped to a SD770-IS.  Overall its a great camera, and takes very nice pictures, almost as nice as the F100fd.  The speed is superb, as expected. However, it does very poorly in low light, and you basically have to plan on using the flash all the time.  My camera also did poorly in bright light, most of the pictures in sunlight were over-saturated.  (The front panel of this particular camera was popping out a little, a manufacturing defect, which may have affected the light meter on the camera).  Given the issues in low and bright light and the front panel problem I decided I would try something else.

I read reviews that the TZ5 pictures were noisy, so I was a little apprehensive about picture quality when I got the camera.  Its somewhat true, if you zoom 16X youll see the pictures get a little grainy.  But after having some developed into prints, you cant tell at all on the prints.  This would only be a problem if you needed to blow the prints up into poster size.  So aside from being able to see grainyness when you blow the picture way up, the picture quality is really good.

The TZ5 did much better than expected in low light - almost as good as the F100fd.  There is more noise than the F100fd, but the overall picture tone and sharpness are still excellent.

I was very happy with the speed.  Almost as good as the Canons, much better than the Fuji.  So this was the keeper for me.

There a lot of other things that I was very pleased with that I didnt consider before buying the camera.  Im particularly pleased with its continuous shooting mode - you can take rapid continuous shots indefinitely at about 2 photos per second.  So if youre shooting kids, its the perfect feature to make sure you catch that one split second smile.  The LCD is just beautiful, it puts my laptop lcd screen to shame.  It also allows you to quickly and easily change settings while in manual mode without having to navigate down a tree of menus.  And the image stabilization is excellent.

There were also some things that were so-so.  Its pre-set white balance is mediocre, but using a custom white balance the pictures are excellent.  The face detection is ok, it doesnt work if the face is pointed a little sideways, or the face is partially obstructed.  The battery life is not bad, but not fantastic.  But since I dont use the flash much Ive never run out of charge.

The video is pretty good, but it has its set of flaws.  Although it records in 720p resolution, the quality is not as sharp as you would expect from a 720p movie.  It looks equivalent a 480i video (in sharpness) from a good camcorder, so its about as good as a decent 480i camcorder.  It records in motion jpeg (quicktime .mov container), which means the video files are much larger than they would be using mp2, mp4, or h.264, and only devices that play quicktime will be able to play it right off the camera.  The microphone isnt very good, so make sure youre close to the subject matter.  The zoom using video is very slow, and the focus is slow (goes in and out) for a few seconds whenever the zoom changes.  All that being said, its great to have video recording - the convenience of having it my camera resulted in me not using our sony camcorder since I got the TZ5.  I end up taking more video and photos now.

The one real issue with the camera is that it doesnt take good pictures when there is a bright background.  With the Canon and Fuji, I would simply use the flash to make sure I didnt end up with a silhouette.  And they both did a great job illuminating the subject matter at an appropriate light level.  The TZ5 does a really poor job with this.  You still end up with under-illuminated subject matter.  Ive tried a bunch of different settings and still have the issue, which is a real shame.

But overall, Im very pleased with the camera.  Its probably the best point-and-shoot that approximates the functionality of a DSLR.  So this one is a keeper for me.</Content>

So far, I havent regretted a single purchase. I am in love with my new panasonic lumix! At first, I thought Panasonic? but after reading the reviews I had to try it. I love all the photos that the camera takes. Even at night the picture is outstanding. I am a beginner photographer and I am still learning all the features. I even like how the camera plays back the photos with a slideshow and music. I say go with the panasonic and you will not be disappointed! The wide zoom angle is terrific and the photo face detection is very helpful! A+ Panasonic</Content>

Outdoor photos tend to be the best--indoor photos can tend to be too dim, especially if flash isnt used.  There is also a slight lag when taking photos indoors if the ISO max 400 feature is used.  The zoom is very impressive--took pictures of a hot air balloon miles away and I could see the people in the basket.  Battery life is averge--around 300 pics.

This is also the only compact digital camera Ive ever owned that never takes pics with red eyes. There are a lot of blue eyes in my family so this is pretty important to me.

The only downside is the crap capture software that Panasonic includes with it. Ironically, that is by far the worst capture software Ive ever seen. Try to get your hands on a copy of Canons ZoomBrowser instead.</Content>

Interior shots are so difficult to convey the size and openess of even large rooms, and I had to retake shots of all listings after I saw what it can do. The zoom lens allows me to frame the shot, eliminating unwanted background images without changing positions. I havent taken the camera off intelligent automatic yet, dont see a need to. Just the best camera on the market for my purposes after researching and trying them all. Get the extra battery and the leather Panasonic case with it.  </Content>

It did fit the 8GB MicroSD card I already had without any problem.
Great video.(Hi def)

<Content>If you know panasonic LUMIX digicams you probably know that the sound bitrate on the videos is cropped at 8khz, thats almost the same quality as the phone line. I knew that but i didnt care because the quality on the video of my previous FX50 was very good. 
The BIG thing on this camera is the INTELLIGENT AUTO, and IT WORKS flawlessly, even taking 4cm macro photos with flash on... the photos looked perfect.
The video (HD video also) are better than the FX50 mainly because you can zoom and you have autofocus, but BIG FLAW on this camera is the autofocus hunting issue, even updating the firmware (version 1.2 that you can download and read the instructions from here http://panasonic.jp/support/global/cs/dsc/download/TZ4_5/index.html) the autofocus doesnt work well. But you can select fixed focus if you want.
Anyway i think its a great camera.</Content>

<Content>Look no further. This is the best travel super-zoom camera on the market in 2008.

After purchasing my TZ5 from Amazon, I recently took it with me to London and Paris. I got exactly the photographs I hoped to take.

Biggest plus - a very useful Night Scene mode.  Made after-dark photography very easy.  Also appreciated is the VIVID color mode enhancement.  This really helps on overcast days.</Content>

<Content>I have had a number of digital cameras over the years but Panasonic has outdone themselves with this one. It has everything you will need whether a professional or just a happy snappy type. The zoom is just fantastic for a camera this size and the photo clarity is excellent. Most will not use all the features this camera has but thats okay since it takes wonderful photos with auto mode set. I also have a 10 megapixel Casio which is good but only has 3x optical zoom while this has 10x. Clarity is great at full zoom and close up. You should buy this camera!</Content>

<Content>was very excited about the camera, but Im having problems with balancing the right lighting for indoor pictures. Many of my pictures where the subject is near a lamp or any kind of light source come out very yellow; even if you change the settings for indoor, party, night etc. I would like the pictures to have brighter colors. I have not printed them yet, will see how they come out. These where very simple pictures and should not be complecated to get a good quality picture.</Content>

<Content>Overall this is a very good and unique camera, and I am glad I purchased it.
Highs:  unbeatable LCD screen, zoom range, quality wide angle lens, small size!, small battery and charger
Lows: compared to my bulkier old Canon S2IS:  less control, fussier autofocus, and unimpressive (weak) fill-flash.  This is flash issue is not something I have read in other reviews, but in my hands the fill flash is poor at lighting up faces with a sunset behind them, for example, despite multiple adjustments.
If you accept the above pros/cons, you might agree that this is a terrific little travel camera.  </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera after our old Olympus died and have used it quite a bit.

Pros:
The camera has an awesome telephoto lens.  The 10x optical zoom is what sold me on the deal.  It also takes great videos and allows zooming during the video.  It supports SDHC cards so you can get an 8Gig card and take TONS of pictures.

Cons:
The autofocus isnt the greatest.  I downloaded and installed a firmware update and that helped but it still isnt perfect.  It isnt terrible, just slightly annoying.  The flash and microphone are both located in places easily covered up by your fingers if youre not paying attention.

Summary:
I recommend this camera.  The pictures are good, although occasionally getting the right focus takes a second try.  The video capability all but eliminates the need for a separate video camera.  The 10x optical zoom is a huge plus.</Content>

<Content>Purchased this camera after going through a survey to figure out just exactly what type of digital camera would be useful for my needs.  I take casual pictures, usually on trips, and am a novice with the digital cameras.  I LOVE IT!!!!  Would definitely recommend to anyone.  Gorgeous pictures, professional quality, and not hard to learn to use.  Ordered a case later (from eBay as I wanted the recommended leather case in brown and they are only sold in Japan right now), and a 16mb memory card from Blue Proton through Amazon.

Received a day earlier than expected from Amazon.  Was in excellent condition, no problems.  </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for my girlfriend for her birthday. She likes to take tons of pictures in different conditions, and the intelligent auto feature handles them all. I have a little more expertise with cameras than her, and found that all the features I would want and could use out of a camera such as this are there. Someone who has never taken a picture before could start taking great pictures with this camera. Anyone with more experience will appreciate the simplicity of this camera and its amazing features. If I was looking for a much higher quality camera, I would expect more features and adjustment, but one would be sacrificing much quality and simplicity which most consumers are looking for in this range. If you are looking for a camera in this price range, this is it. 10x zoom is great.</Content>

<Content>This has been a superb camera for all of my adventures.  It is small enough to take camping, and on long range vacations.  One place that it really shines is underwater.  With the Panasonic waterproof case, and the special color setting to balance out the blue, my underwater photos are brighter, and more colorful than ever before.  The programmed settings for scenery, self-portrait, soft skin, the beach, fireworks, etc. really bring out the best in the pictures.

I highly recommend this camera, and - in fact - purchased a second as a wedding goft for my friends.  Thats how highly I regard this camera!

The shake compensation feature effectively extends my capabilities for telephoto and low-light photography.  Close up nature photos are so crisp and clear that you clearly can see the eyelashes on a Gecko.  The image quality is superb, and color rendition rarely needs any tweaking in Photoshop.  The photos that I took while on vacation, copmpared side-to-side with my friends, with their other cameras (even one with a major brand SLR) were brighter, clearer, and more detailed.  My friend, to whom I gave a matching camera captured great pictures, also - with ease!

I love the video feature which allows you to zoom - an upgrade to other Panasonic cameras - and capture great moments.  With the waterproof case, this is the perfect compact camera.

<Content>I wanted to get a camera that was closer to a DLSR in quality and features, but that wasnt bulky.  I wanted to get a camera that I could not only use casually at home and around town, but also on vacation where I tend to take a greater variety of camera shots.  The TZ5 checked all the boxes and then some!

Other reviews compare it to the Canon sd870is and other cameras so I wont go into that here.  Heres how I see it:
Pros:
- The lens and 10x optical zoom.  Simply fantastic.  I know, you may think you dont need the zoom.  And I agree, for the most part, you probably dont.  Im certainly no professional photographer, but I thought about it, and those occassions when I do need more than your standard 3-4x zoom actually comes up more often than I would have thought - whether video taping an at bat for a baseball game or taking a close up photo from a moderate distance.  And since I bought it, I have wound up using the zoom far more than I would have expected.  Particularly in the 5-8x range for a variety of shots.  This is key since many other comparable cameras only have zoom up to 4x.

-  The wide angle!  This is my first wide angle camera and boy does it make a difference from your standard point and shoot!  I wont go back.  Its more than just getting more into a shot, in many cases, its the difference between getting a shot framed properly or not. Getting the whole background or building or whatever into the shot or not.

- Pre-set camera modes are great.  The TZ5 has 15+ pre-set camera modes that really are great for different environments.  Whats even better is that you can set two of those modes into the dial at top for quick access.  This way, you dont have to keep adjusting the mode for each shot.  For instance, at night, I pre-set the dial at top to candle light and night portrait and can quickly take shots that way.

-  Great picture quality. Ive read various commentary on the superiority of the Canon picture.  I havent done side by side comparisons but what I can say is that Ive taken a lot of photos and am very satisfied.  And anyways, Im skeptical of some of these side by side comparisons on photo quality.  So much of a photo is the setting, light, etc that you shouldnt be using the standard auto setting to get the best picture regardless.  I doubt those comparisons adjusted each camera appropriately for each shot.

-  Crisp, large 3 LCD screen.  This is one of the primary differences between the TZ4 (comes with 2.5 screen) and TZ5.

-  Long exposure shots are really, really cool.  This camera takes amazing low light, night time shots.  The exposure is 15 or 30 seconds but literally (if you dont move for that long), you can get AMAZING night time shots without a flash and with really cool light effects.

-  Very cool burst shooting.  This is indespensible for action or fast moving shots.  You can do normal burst shooting of any camera setting at about 2.5-3 pics/second and you can do it continuously!  You can also do a high-burst at 6 pics/second at 2 megapixel quality.  I got great shots diving off a boat in mid-air with this.

-  For the lens and quality its relatively compact.  While its bigger than your standard compact point and shoot, its still small enough to fit in your pocket.  Its about the size of an old school ipod, though thicker, and its way better than slugging around a DSLR.  And the design is ergonomic.

And now some Cons:

-  HD video recording.  The quality of the HD picture on playback is great.  But there are two shortcomings with this feature. 1) Sound quality is as you would expect for a camera. So its sort of like HD picture/low tech camera sound.  It wont replace your HD camcorder, but its certainly good enough for casual recordings. 2) Takes up a ton of memory.  I got a 16GB card and that will record about 30min of HD video.  Not a lot if you want to take a lot of pics as well on a vaca.  I just wind up taking normal non-HD videos, which works fine.

-  Auto zoom on video recording is annoying.  You need to turn the feature off when taking video, otherwise your video will be in and out of focus as you zoom.  But the ability to zoom WHILE taking video is a differentiator for this camera vs. others.  Also, some of the features still a work in progress.  For instance, the auto face detect works some times, but not others. 

-  There are not many manual adjustments you can make- primarily shutter speed/exposure and other standard features common in most point and shoot cameras.  Obviously I wouldnt expect this to be as flexible as a DLSR, but just something to keep in mind.

-  Camera has two automated picture shot modes (where it takes a picture by itself) and the delay is either 2 or 10 seconds.  I use this mode a lot - this way everyone can get into a pic!  I wish they had longer delay time and more lead up warning to when the picture is going to be taken.  

In summary, I would highly recommend this camera for anyone who wants the ability to take a wide variety of high quality pics but doesnt want to lug around a big camera.  The cons are far outweighed by the pros.  Dont hesitate - you will love this camera!</Content>

<Content>After reviewing my first set of prints, I decided to return this camera.  I really wanted to love this camera.  Compact body (fits in pocket nicely), 10X zoom, and intelligent auto focus.  Whats not to love?  However, the picture quality and color were only so-so, and were especially worse in low light and indoor shots.  Intelligent auto focus did not seem to work particularly well for me and was inconsistent (I could shoot the same shot multiple times and get different results).  The deal breaker for me:  Long first shot delay...which means you will miss a shot of your kids if it needs to be taken quicky (ex. kid on swing or kid petting animal).  Also, many of the zoom shots were difficult to focus. A big dissapointment for me.       </Content>

<Content>Back before digital cameras, I had a 35mm and a bunch of lenses. I have the 55mm that came with the camera, a 35mm wide angle and a 150mm telephoto. Later on, I got a 28mm to 60mm wide angle zoom and a few years after that, I got a 135mm to 230mm telephoto zoom. I had a whole bag full os lenses. It took a while to get anything on film because it took minutes to ponder the shot, get all the hardware assembled and take it. Then, that was pretty much state of the art in amature photography...

During the digital age, I had a few Sony Mavika cameras that were horrible cameras, but had a long zoom lense on them. They were big and heavy and shot 1.3mp to 2.0mp shots. I then got a little Cannon that was a great little pocket camera but only had a 3X zoom and didnt do it. I then got a Kodak that had a 10X zoom, but it didnt have anything close to a wide angle. I still have most of that hardware and all of it put together cannot hold a candle to this new Panasonic TZ5K.

This one little Panasonic pocket camera does everything that all that bag of expensive 35mm hardware, and all those digital cameras, do and much more. I have never seen another camera, especially one that you can put in your pocket, that has such a high quality 28mm wide angle with a 10X zoom to 280mm.

It has amazing features that I have never seen on a camera before, but this is the first camera I have purhased one in a couple of years. I especially like the ability to add a 5 sec. voice clip along with the picture so you can remember what the shot was all about. Some of the reviews I have read say it has issues with some of the quality standards, but all I see is wonderful pictures...

For a full range, take every picture you will probably want, and still fit in your pocket, this is the only camera I have found that works.</Content>

<Content>I did extensive research before purchasing a digital camera. I wanted a well-known brand with all the features that I could possibly get at a reasonable price. This camera satisfied that exactly. While it is pricier than some of the other new cameras coming into play recently, you certainly get what you pay for. I was much impressed at the tremendous zoom power that this camera offers. I took a few sample photos in my backyard just to test out the camera and play around a bit. I was truly amazed that I could zoom in and see every fiber/hair on some of the plants in my yard. The clear, distinct picture taken certainly looked professional grade, and the clarity of the picture was unbelievable. The pictures taken were so crystal clear that they almost didnt look real! I am very impressed with the performance of this camera and look forward to preserving all of my memories in beautifully captured pictures.

On a side note, one thing that kind of stinks about the camera is while it provides a large digital screen to view the pictures, it is so large that there really isnt very much space around it to put your fingers to hold the camera, so it always seems that I am touching the screen and leaving fingerprints all over it (and I have TINY sized hands, too). Easy fix, I can simply wipe off the fingerprints, but it can get annoying at times having to do it so often.</Content>

<Content>Ive wanted a version of this camera for over a year.  I dabble in photography  think of myself as a pretty creative individual, but this camera makes my photos look  professional.  I do suggest you order a SD or SDHC card, screen protector, and camera case at the same time.  You should also expect that everyone will want to hold your camera and take a test photo.  
I was able to use the camera right out of the box and am continuing to learn about the cameras finer points and multiple image type choices.  For instance, there is an airplane mode feature that allows you to take stunning photos from the window of an airplane as if you were sitting on the wing.  There is also a face detection feature that was something not available on my previous camera.  It still gives me pause when it appears but it also make sure that everyone looks clear  crisp with no red eye.
One thing you should be aware of is that there is no viewfinder.  I used a traditional 35mm for many years and gradually grew out of using the viewfinder with my last digital camera, but dont even miss it on the Lumix because of the gorgeous image that pops up on the 3 inch LCD screen.  Also, it doesnt hurt that the movies taken with this camera are just as gorgeous.  
I also experienced a lag time when taking photos with my last camera, but that is nonexistent with the Lumix and this makes sure that I get my shot every time.  Hope you have as much fun with this camera.

<Content>I have had this camera for about a month. I tried different modes on the camera and tried to utilize the functions. the menu is fairly easy to use even for the novice beginner. Camera when you use the scene modes like beach, etc..takes clear accurate pictures. The colors seems to be like the scene that I took the pictures of . Color representation is very Good ! 
I did notice that you do have to wait a second or two for the camera to focus and then take the picture. If you do not wait till it finishes focusing for those quick shots then the pictures turn out somewhat blurry. Other than that its a Wonderful camera with a lot of scene modes. There are not a lot of manual features for those camera buffs who want to control every aspect of a picture. Most of the modes are all automatic and work just fine for the normal camera user. 
Then ten times optical zoom works Great !! It really brings those far away objects very close. Also lets you bring in the faces and people much closer to more of a 35mm camera film type shot. There are more features that I have not used yet but I would Highly Recommend this camera for the 10x optical zoom and the scene modes. It also has the capacity to use High Capacity SD cards also so you can take a lot of pictures. Battery lasts a good while on this camera also so that should not be a problem for most people.</Content>

<Content>I bought the TZ5 because I was in the market for a camera with wideangle zoom (28mm equiv or wider), good telephoto zoom, good overall photo quality, modern features, manual controls, compact size, at a competitive good price.  The TZ5 excels at these criteria making me happy I bought it.  My wife loves it, too.  Its my 5th digital camera but only the first shes been enthusiastic about using.

The one downside is the cameras weak ergonomics.  Perhaps because of the small overall size and the huge LCD on the back, theres basically no right way to hold it with just one hand.  Up front, the flash is positioned very close to the grip.  Its too easy to cover up accidentally with my fingers.  Around back, my thumb rubs against the menu button frequently, which forces the camera out of picture-taking mode until I exit the menu.  My hands are relatively small; I imagine itd be worse for most adults.  The only solution is to hold the camera gingerly, with both hands.  Its a nuisance that detracts from an otherwise excellent camera.  With slightly better ergonomics Id give it an enthusiastic five stars.

<Content>Small enough for a pocket, this camera fits the hand naturally. I got quality shots straight out of the box without flipping through pages of instruction, as the menu-driven options are numerous and intuitive. The zoom is fast, and gives good resolution at max 10x. Photo and movie quality is superb, although the built-in microphone could be a bit stronger for audio from 6 feet or more at normal voice level. Macro produces clear, tight images. I recommend 16GB cards if movies are your thing - they chew through 4GB in no time. Great little camera - will definitely go with me everywhere.

<Content>My old 3.2 MP camera was dying so I needed a replacement.  I wanted something with more than the standard 3x optical zoom, compact, and well built.  The TZ5 seem to fit the bill so decided to give it a try.

I had the TZ5 [blue model] for 3 weeks and snapped over 200 pictures.  The camera looks good and feels well built.  It is easy to hold even for those with small hands. Camera responds quickly. Menus are responsive and easy to navigate.  I think it takes great videos for a digital camera with okay sound.  However, photo quality is mixed.

Outdoor pictures were okay.  They were great in that the 10x optical zoom allows one to take pictures from further away than the standard 3x optical zoom many cameras have.  However, the pictures themselves were generally good, but not exceptional.

Indoor and low light photos were a major disappointment.  With the Lumix TZ5, most of my indoor shots were at best just okay.  Many seem to have a yellow or brownish haze.  Generally, colors were not accurate. Photo editing software rendered them okay for 4x6 prints.  Although I tried adjusting the settings many times and in different ways,  I just could not snap a good indoor or low light photo with this camera. My old camera did much better with such situations.

Ultimately, I returned this camera.  Amazon.com was great with the return and the refund.  

As a replacement, I purchased the Sony Cybershot DSCW150 8.1MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot (Silver) which generally snaps great pictures in all lighting situations (with and without flash) with little effort and little (if any) post photo editing.  Though it does not have a 10x optical zoom, it still offers a wider and longer [30 mm - 150 mm] lens than many other cameras.  I am very happy with this Great Lil Gem!

<Content>I wanted a small camera for still photos and video and my research pointed to this camera (Lumix TZ5). I am not disappointed after using it for a month. I had been very satisfied with my tiny Canon Elph cameras over the years, but wanted something that would give me 16:9 wide screen capability and better quality video. I find I am using video more and more and really enjoy making short DVDs (using Apple iMovie) after a trip or event. I incorporate still pictures and video (movies) in the DVDs.

As an example, I recently attended a music concert featuring (among others) my grandson. The performance was in a poorly lit auditorium, so the low light capabilities were tested. My son was also shooting video using his Sony Handycam (several years old, mini-DV), so I had an opportunity to compare. I was very pleased with the video quality (shooting in hi-def) and my camera clearly outperformed his. One feature I really appreciated was the ability to view the video on the cameras display and take snapshots of specific frames from the video which can be done at any time. This is the best way to get just the right still picture (my grandson is a drummer, so it is important to capture facial expression, hand position, relationship to other performers, etc). I absolutely love this feature and used it extensively.  The biggest problem (as many others have mentioned) is sound quality; the sound is OK if you are just shooting a couple of people talking in a quiet room, but was terrible in the concert/auditorium setting. For sound, my sons Handycam definitely outperformed the TZ5. Fortunately, I was able to use his soundtrack along with my video in making the DVD.

Recording video in Hi-Def with this camera gives a better result than using the non-Hi-Def widescreen option (I tested it both ways), even if you dont ultimately use the Hi-Def when making a DVD (I dont). I bought an 8GB Sandisk SDHC Extreme III memory card and used the included card reader (you need a special card reader for SDHC) to import the videos into my iMac. It was a simple process, and iMovie treated the Hi-Def video like any other import, no special formatting needed. I assume it would be just as simple on a PC using most current editing software. Recording in HD limits the length of a single continuous clip to about 8 1/2 minutes; this is not a problem for me, but could be in some situations. Memory size is the only limit to how many such clips you can shoot consecutively.

I have considered getting a separate sound recorder to use along with the camera (there are some very good portable digital audio recorders out there), but decided that would be too much trouble and defeat the purpose of an easy-to-use camera. So, I will just learn to live with the sound limitations (I rarely shoot performances; mostly just friends and family or travel shots).

I have been pleased with the still photo quality; it is as good as the Canon Elphs. I love the 16:9 format. This camera has a variety of adjustment options which I have not tried yet, and is easy to use and hold. Many adjustments (e.g., exposure compensation, various focus options, zoom) are also available in the movie mode.

The TZ5 is  a beautiful piece of equipment, and feels solid and well made. One caveat, though: it is easy to accidentally block the microphone while holding the camera, and doing so makes the marginal sound unusable, so I have to train myself how to hold the camera.

Before I bought this camera, I considered buying one of the new AVCHD video cameras (such as Canon HF10 or Sony SR12) but chose the TZ5 because of its portability, flexibility, still photo capability, and price. I think the cameras of the future will combine high quality video/sound and high quality still photo capability (and portability), and today the TZ5 is the best compromise. Tomorrow, who knows?

<Content>I needed a new digital camera so I thought I would upgrade to the Panasonic Lumix camera. The camera is GREAT! The picture clarity is outstanding, the zoom is amazing and the camera is so small and compact that it fits everywhere! I would recommend this camera for the photographer looking for more than just an average picture taking experience.

Youll see mixed reviews on the quality of the photos, but I find the quality outstanding for a compact camera, or for any camera for that matter.  The photos that youll see are all taken in the easy mode, which is called IA for Intelligent Auto, and they were all taken without flash - even the one inside the screened porch.  
What I love most about this camera is its ability to keep the subject in focus, even when the subject and/or the photographer is moving!  I shot a butterfly fluttering around, with the zoom (in IA mode) and it came out perfectly in focus.  The photo of the horse  buggy was also taken effortlessly in IA mode with the zoom.  Photos from the airplane, perfect, even took a few from the moving car and there was no blur (not in the samples)!  Amazing.  Colors are bright and clear, and you can choose how vivid you want them to be.  These photos were taken in standard color, incidentally.  It picked up all the hues of the sunrise in the harbor and sunset on the beach.
The zoom works beautifully, very smooth and quiet.  Again, automatic focus in zoom (and otherwise) is the best Ive seen in any camera of this size and price range.
I love the wide angle lens.  It captures so much more than Im used to and gives a really nice, almost dimensional look to the photos.
The battery life is pretty good until you use the movie mode, and that does take a lot out of it.  Its a good idea to have an extra one ready just in case.
The ergonomics are excellent, easy to shoot with one hand, and easy to navigate the menu.
The LCD screen, as you know, is one of the best out there.  It works well in sunlight, and if the day is very bright, you can adjust the contrast and make the screen darker if needed.  Beautiful resolution when playing back your photos on the LCD screen!
The movie feature is also quite good FOR A DIGITAL PHOTO CAMERA.  The zoom is slow (which it states in the manual), but the pictures are clear.  HD mode does take a lot of memory and battery obviously, but its a great feature to have.  I shot some whales from the shore with zoom at 10x and they came out pretty well even though they were quite far away (contact me if youd like to see that video).  I took the movie of Frisky indoors in the evening with the regular lighting in the home and it I think it looks very good.
In conclusion, I highly recommend the Panasonic DMC-TZ5.  It is not a digital SLR, but has many of the features without the bulk or the price, so its great for travel.  I have an SLR and an older 5MP compact digital, but I never expected this much photo quality out of a compact.  
Bravo Panasonic!</Content>

<Content>I did a lot of research on cameras, and I am glad I purchased this one.  Its very simple, works great, even though its not a video camera it does a great job.  Just know that when taking a video, that when you try to zoom in or out the picture loses focus and sometimes dosent recover very fast or at all.  Plan on keeping it in one position, hey after all its not a video camera.  The view finder is awesome, great detail and supper clear.  I didnt think the 10x zoom was all that necessary, but I was wrong, I use it a lot, more then I thought, works great.  For a point and shoot camera I would put it up to just about anything.  Battery life is great never had a problem plenty of power.  I got the blue one, and its nice.  Wont need a new camera for a while this should do the job for quite some time. Five stars,</Content>

With the Sony we were lucky to get 1 really great picture out of 20 taken, and with the Panasonic we are lucky to get 1 bad picture out of 20.  We are very pleased and the battery life is good too.  300+ shots on one battery.  The zoom is fabulous, image stableizing is fantastic.

<Content>This camera does not disappoint as long as you are not looking for total creative control.  This is the camera you take along when you want to have fun and not worry about fiddling with settings to get the perfect shot.  The zoom is amazing and worth the price alone.  It takes stunning photographs in almost every situation.  Professional reviews claim that the cameras photo processing software blurs some details.  I have not seen this in the extremely crisp photos I have taken, nor have I seen it in extreme magnification of the photos.  The video capability is pretty good, but dont buy this camera if you really need a camcorder.  I find the camera intuitively easy to use and especially like the quick menu and speedy zoom features.  This is a camera you can use right out of the box.</Content>

We took in on vacation and used the zoom from across the street and it looks like we are standing right in front of the place.  The sunset mode it EXCELLANT.  You can take a picture out the window while in a moving vehicle and it turns out perfect.  We have children, it takes pictures of their sports and doesnt come out blurred.  Its great to catch moving children or animals.  There is no down side to this camera.  Worth every penny.</Content>

Dont get me wrong, this is a great camera, and in a pinch, it works great, but dont expect it to supplement an SLR at say, a concert, or a pocket point and shoot, for extreme portability. If you are willing to compromise, buy it, because it truly is the closest to having the best of both worlds...

<Content>This camera have more built in useful features than I knew about before I made the purchase. But one feature I miss -the all manual mode- where you, if you have a tripod, can play around like a pro photographer setting your exposure time to several seconds for night photography. 

On the other hand, choosing from the built in settings is wonderful. You get so much better color on sunsets using the preset sunset-program to fully automatic mode. 
But be ware: one big error appear in sunset mode also! -there is an (aberration?, sorry, not familiar with all the terms in photography) error in color display; an extra color (green) appearing between colors/in the border between shade and sunny parts of an object like rock, faces, bodies and so on. This was very disappointing and should be corrected in future and new releases. 

The extra button for one click to max zoom is brilliant and is a very time saving feature when shifting from wide to telephoto situation. 
I conclude that TZ5a is all in all a great camera for the price.

But dont bother buying expedited shipping, it take too long to be worth it.</Content>

<Content>Have had the TZ5  a few weeks, my wife has had the TZ3  a year.  Both are good; the LCD monitor is improved on the 5, could still have less glare, and be easier to see in the sun (were in AZ). I think the pictures are very good, at least on my monitor so far; sharp, good color. Theres much to learn about this camera, fairly well written manual; it should  have a more complete index. I , like others, would like manual control options, a viewfinder, filter screw-in capability. I highly recommend it.</Content>

<Content>We gave it a four star instead of a five star since despite the wonderful features it is still a point and shoot camera.  It would have been nice to add some features that allow you to change the aperture, for example (not a lot, just some).  Otherwise, this camera is very intelligent and takes great pictures (in wide screen form too that allows you to view it on ones HD TV with no black bars on either side); the mini movie feature is excellent and pick up sound a long way off too.  Recommend you to get a 16gb disc to go with it as the movie can take a lot of space!  Highly recommended as a compact camera</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera simply because it has the largest zoom in a compact body. Features wise, no complaints. Works as advertised.

I do have minor concerns that I like to share. Not very important to me but may be help to others:
- When recording movies, I find the sound play back is terrible. A lot of whoosing sound. I think part of the problem is that the reording mic is at the left top side. And one may accidently cover the mic without knowing.

- The other is the flash. It is on the right side. Your fingers may close part of it.

Bottom line, just be aware, and you should be off taking nice pictures.

<Content>I am an OC kinda guy. I like to be sure that I get the most for my money when I make a purchase. I outline exactly what I want and what I expect from my purchase BEFORE I start shopping. I spent 7 months reading, comparing and researching all similar Ulta Compact and Compact cameras before I made my choice. I would have been even happier if this camera had 10 Megapixels instead of 9.1 ... only so it matched others that I was comparing (I compared 12s too, pics generally were NOT as good). Frankly, I am extremely happy with the fabulous pics this camera produces. I FIRST thought that I wish it were a little smaller - now I am very happy that it is not. If it were much smaller I dont believe it would be as easy and comfortable to use. Yes!. I handled nearly a dozen of its competitors, as well. I read every review (Pro and Users) I could find anywhere (online, magazines, trade journals). Be carefull with some of them. I put a lot of weight in reviews by the Pros, HOWEVER I found that many of the things they said about this camera were not true. Some of their comments caused me to pause and almost not buy this camera. Some talked about features they wish this camera had, that others did have ... only I found that SEVERAL such features ARE present in this camera. Some features that they reviewed as a Negative, after learning how to use them turn out to be a great POSITIVE. The ZOOM is very sharp and the Wide angle really helps me get shots that would NOT be possible with other similar cameras! You wont need the flash as much as with other cameras. The camera can adjust the ISO (as well as many other settings, in IA mode) to give you great shots when you cant use a flash (and you can set it to 6400 ISO for very dim non-flash shots). I was happy with my long-arrived-at choice the day I bought it. If I knew THEN what I know NOW ... I would have bought it much sooner! I enjoy it more everyday! I planned to use my PRO Camera (a $2500.00 Olympus system - 18 months of research) for all the things that this camera would not be able to do ... NOW I know that this Panasonic will do a fine job for 90 to 95% of all the camera tasks that I want to do! AND it is much much smaller and lighter! I find I am using my Pansonic more and more everyday!. I do suggest you get a couple of 1300 Mah batteries and a couple of 8 Gig LEXAR (Yes, the brand matters - they are much faster 20 Mb/sec) SDHC cards if you plan to do lots of serious picture taking as I do. This camera has an excellent battery life compared to others, but I take LOTS of PICS and videos and need the extra batteries. You can stop looking now. You WILL enjoy this camera! (By the way MROCK makes a perfect case for it and a spare battery and spare memory card, I am now looking for a very small case, when I want to take just the camera in a pocket). Have FUN with it!</Content>

<Content>I am not a photographer.  I was looking for a very reliable point and shoot that was compact(could fit in my pants pocket) and had more than 3x zoom.  I spent a month researching the internet sites from CNET to Amazon to Bobs camera and visiting Best Buy.  I have an old Minolta DiMage 4x, 4MP.  Its bulk precludes taking it with me unnoticeably(geek factor), so I miss out on taking shots.  I liked the Sony 150 priced at $249.00(forgot name), and would have kept it if it had more zoom.  It was fast, compact and took great pictures.  Then, I looked at the compact 7X by Olympus.  Nice little camera, but when it came to handling, the Lumix was definitely more convenient.  You can hold the Lumix in your right hand and shoot simultaneously, so I bought the Lumix for about $50.00 more than the Sony 150.  It has a large LCD screen which is a must without a viewfinder (the viewfinder adds to the bulk of the camera and with a nice sized LCD it is essentially obsolete).  The Lumix has lots of options.  It takes great pictures, even at night with variable iso settings. I got some great shots of a fair at night with all the neon lites glowing.  It has a burst feature which has been present on digital cameras for years.  However, when not using the burst mode, Lumix is slow going from picture to picture in a rapid fashion.  Other downside - no proprietary camera case to protect the LCD screen(film protectors come off) and beautiful zoom lens.  Nonetheless, I bought it and like it and recommend it over the Olympus 7x for handling and the Sony 150 for zooming. You get what you pay for - just dont spend good money after bad.  I dont think I did.</Content>

<Content>4.5 stars.  After about a thousand shots I have found that this camera has really held up to my expectations.  It takes great photos, its easy to convince the camera what you want it to do, and focusing is a breeze compared to most PS cameras Ive owned and tried lately.  And the screen on the back is nothing short of utterly beautiful--high resolution and large size make for easy picture taking and reviewing.

Performance:

I get good sharp photos on at least 80% of attempts (and I rarely use flash so thats quite something considering some of the conditions I shoot in). I typically use the Auto mode (dial selection with the red camera icon) and move the camera around to lock the exposure with a half-press of the shutter button.  For nine out of ten tourist shots this works great, and it is pretty good in macro mode as well.  Its sometimes difficult to convince it to use a faster shutter speed without using one of the other (virtually indecipherable) scene modes.  I really wish I could specify a minimum shutter speed so I could guarantee an un-blurred shot.   

As for the special scene modes, unless you need something in there that you cant set yourself, I suggest ignoring these unless you want to memorize a ridiculous array of special conditions for each mode.  The complexity of what it enables and disables in each mode is ludicrous, there are even modes that limit the image size selection for no apparent reason. For example, in Intellegent Auto mode you can use any size except 7 MP... Whatever.

User Interface:

The user interface on this camera is second to none, extremely convenient access to most settings, and very easy to use.  This one has even figured out how to put the red-eye flash settings in the same place as the other flash settings (why everybody doesnt do that I cant imagine). I NEVER find myself fumbling around trying to find a setting, almost everything I need regularly is a one-button toggle, or an easy quick-menu accessible with a single button press.  One downside is that the mode dial selector is easy to accidentally move while pocketing the camera so if youre not paying attention you may likely shoot some pics in an unintended mode (this is perhaps the most significant problem Ive had with this camera).  One really nice thing about this camera is that the power switch is an actual switch and no other buttons or actions will turn on any function of the camera.  This means it doesnt turn on accidentally in your pocket and waste batteries or extend the lens unnecessarily (a flaw that has Canon owners ruining lens motors at an alarming rate).

Optics:

While I was wishing theyd focused their efforts on a wider aperture lens (for more light gathering capability) rather than the super wide and super zoom features, I must say the optical range of this camera is incredible.  I took a four day trip to NYC and I was never left wanting for wider angle shots or more telephoto.  I took everything from cityscapes and zoomed pics of building tops to self portraits and wide macro close-ups, there was so much flexibility--more than any lens Ive ever owned (SLR included).  The macro works great too, and can focus on subjects amazingly close, you can get a full-frame picture of a quarter from a half inch away.  I snapped a shot of a flowers innards and didnt even realize until I got home that Id also captured a caterpillar buried deep within the folds of the flowers petals.  Incredible.  One downside to the super-wide aspect though, youll notice a significant distortion around the edges where the fisheye effect is quite apparent, especially in city-scapes with parallel buildings that appear to tilt toward each other.  I was able to correct this somewhat by not zooming to the fully-wide setting.

Battery:

Battery life seems to be quite good.  On first charge I shot over 300 pics and the battery indicator still read full.  I was afraid that it would suddenly decline leaving me with little warning, but 300 pics is pretty good anyway.  Now, after a four-day vacation snapping upwards of 250 photos a day, the longest day concluded with one of three battery bars depleted, two bars remaining.  If thats a reasonable estimation of remaining power then I am suitably impressed.  For reference, I use stabilizer mode 2 (on all the time), continuous focus mode OFF, and flash on maybe 5% of my pictures.  I also turn it off between shots if its going to be a minute or more.

One note for new buyers:  The battery does not come pre-charged, so be prepared to spend two hours reading the manual while your battery charges before you can use the camera.  Sorry folks, you cant bring it home from the store and start using it right away--but it does charge quickly.  

The best thing about the battery though is the tiny little travel charger that comes with it--no clumsy cords, just a very compact block (smaller than a deck of cards and just a tad thicker) with flip-out prongs that plugs into the wall with the battery snapped in.  It easily fits unnoticed in my travel kit.


*** A few significant details you may not see elsewhere: ***

1.  Since image quality drops off quickly at ISO settings over 200 I was glad to find that it had a way to specify a max ISO in the auto ISO mode, but unfortunately the lowest option is 400, which it chooses for nearly all indoor shots.  Also, some modes ignore this setting so even though you may think youll always be under 400, you wont in certain scene modes.  For example, many of the shots I took in sport scene mode from a moving boat were shot at 800 despite having set the max to 400.  This ISO limit appears to only apply to automatic mode (the dial setting with the red camera icon).  Further hindering ISO control is the fact that it does not tell you what ISO your picture will be taken at, even after exposure lock with a half-press, even with maximum display info selected.  It will show you the chosen aperture and shutter speed, but it doesnt reveal ISO until after the picture is taken.

2.  I can not understand why they do this in the first place, and its even more frustrating to not be able to turn it off or choose some options in this feature:  This camera subdivides your photos into separate folders of pictures and as far as I can tell theres no way around it.  If you dont ever mess around with the files on the card, it will take 999 pictures per folder.  This is not a huge deal if your average outing/vacation is less than 999 pictures, but with todays unlimited file name length I would really rather keep sequentially counting file numbers limitlessly, and not use folders to break them up.  I can not imagine why they think everyone would want this (or anyone for that matter). I could almost understand if they separated them by date or some other criterion.  With other cameras I have always just had them all in the same folder, that way I dont have to go switching around looking for the photos, theyre all in the same place.  

3. Amazons price on this camera fluctuates on a daily basis, both up and down.  Since I started looking last week the price started at $270, went up to $296, and is now back to $284.  I have no idea why, but if todays price is closer to $300 you might consider waiting a day or two to see if it gets better.

Those are the main points I wanted to share at the moment.  I may be back with more info after a few thousand shots.  

A brief background on my purchase... I initially started this quest to find the most compact camera with the most SLR-style features I could get.  The natural choice for that pursuit is the Canon G9 which was the front runner until I played with this TZ5.  It handled simple point  shoot operations so much better than the canon while inside the store that I was swayed to consider this Panasonic more seriously.  The downside is that it offers virtually no SLR-like features.  My first priority was to get a portable, pocketable camera, which both of these models fit, but the panasonic moreso.  I wanted good point-and-shoot performance with the option to get more creative when I want.  Since embracing the digital revolution eight years ago I havent even touched my film SLR again, not once.  But I miss the manual control so much.  In the end this Panasonic PS won me over, I think the Canon is not quite there yet to be what I want for manual control.  Its a little clumsier in terms of user interface, and its gone after way too many megapixels at the cost of low light capability.

In short, this Panasonic is a great camera, I would buy it again in a second.</Content>

<Content>I took this camera on a five-country European trip in July and took about 1,000 photos with it. The photos come out just great in IA mode. Press down and the camera makes its first assumption on what it is youre focusing, if thats not correct, release and try again. Face recognition works great, too. And most important to me was that it takes great photos in low light without a flash. I had the flash off for all my shots. I got the camera in blue which is done in a powder-type of coating. I didnt care for that at first, but now I like it because it makes the camera a little grippier and it looks great.

Two things that could need fixing:

1. When taking a movie, the zoom makes a noice when zooming in and out.
2. When reviewing your photos, holding down the advance button should fast-forward you through the photos. It only does one at a time. When you have 4 or 8 gig cards, that can be a lot of clicking through.

Overall though, I love this camera and would buy it again. </Content>

<Content>Im loving my Panasonic DMC-TZ5. I agree with others about the fine versatility and daylight image quality. Unfortunately the TZ5 uses the same automatic lens cover mechanism as the DMC-TZ3. This is a too fragile mechanism. Like other TZ3 owners, eventually my TZ3 lens cover failed to fully open/close. Im hoping I get at least a couple years out of the TZ5 before any failures. Fingers crossed.

<Content>I read the reviews of this camera on the various digital camera sites.  While they all mentioned a high level of noise, they still recommended it.   So I bought it.   How bad could the noise be?  

The answer is very bad.  I wasnt expecting miracles from a compact camera.  But... indoors, outdoors, low light, bright light, flash, no flash, zoom, no zoom... the images coming out of this camera were decidedly, noticeably subpar.  

I loved the build quality, zoom, features, size, weight, and styling.  I really wanted to like this camera.  But I had to return it.  I bought a PowerShot G9 instead, which I am very happy with.

<Content>I was looking for a camera that fit in my pocket, but yet offers big zoom, wide angle, 3 LCD, good picture quality, and smart auto mode. I came to TZ5. It has a huge 10x optical zoom that you dont see on any other pocket cameras. The 28mm wide angel is very useful. The 3 LCD with 2x the resolution to all major brand cameras on the market, what that means is youll get a much better, vivid view on your LCD screen than any other cameras out there. I also find the iAuto mode (intelligent auto) extremely useful. It would analyze the current situation and determine the best suitable scene setting and focus mode for you (face, center, macro, etc). It is very accurate, and smarter/better than any of the previous cameras Ive owned (canon,sony,nikon,minolta,fuji). I believe that is the whole point of a Point-and-shoot camera. But that doesnt mean TZ5 is gimp on the manual settings. It offers a lot of manual setting for those whole like full control of their cameras. But to me I just prefer simplicity. Oh and the 720p HD video record is nice too but only with mono sound.

The slightly downside is that it is a little bigger than other pocket cameras, but that is perfectly acceptable with all its extensive features that you wont find on those tiny cameras. I also do not understand why Panasonic offers the HD video recording feature but with only mono sound.</Content>

<Content>I own the 1st gen canon digital rebel DSLR, and these pictures seem sharper, and the camera does a much better job of exposing the scenes. It does a reasonable job at higher ISO levels, but not as good as the DSLR, but I didnt expect it to be. I tried to lighten my load last year, and bought a Kodak, but it was not nearly good as my old DSLR, so the DSLR was still the preferred camera. However I think my second attempt Ive got it right. The TZ5 eliminates the need for me to carry a large DSLR with 2 heavy lenses and a video camera. The TZ5 is now my camera of choice and has replaced all that. Im not a pro, just want some good quality images and videos of my family. 

For its size, the Camera is heavier than expected, but not too heavy. It a good heft, and helps with stability. It feels like its made well, and not the plastic toy feel that many cameras I tested had. 

The video was just as important to me, and the quality on these videos are great. Not as good as my video camera as they are a little more grainy and sound not as good, but i think if I put it on a high def TV, the tz5 would win. The Video is not choppy and the colors are nice. The videos are large, but they can easily be converted to another format that is smaller. The zoom is slower than expected in video mode only, but compared to all other point and shoots that dont zoom at all in video, I think it is fine. There have been some comments about sound Quality here, and it had me worried, but I must say, that for 8bit mono, its not horrible. I would put the sound q at 3 stars, as long as your just recording dialog. 

The amount of features are incredible. I used the auto slide show, and my kids really loved watching, on the television, the automatic slideshow it created complete. It comes complete with 5 different music styles and several transisiton effects. Its quick, easy and fun. 
The other feature that is not talked about much is the burst mode. It takes a about 2 pictures a second for as long as you hold down the button. It also has a High speed burst mode that takes 2 megapixel shots at about 4 or 5 shots per second. It kinda makes a flip book effect. its incredibly fast. 

The camera is easy to use and the menues are well thought out and easy.  My wife took the camera the first day we owned it to disneyland without me, and she had no instructions on how to use it. She had no problems using the camera, and took some great pictures and videos.  She stayed with the IA mode, and that did all the thinking for her and the pics look fantastic.

Dont forget to update to the latest Firmware. ver 1.2 at the time of this writing. My tz5 had 1.1 loaded from the factory. And as many have mentioned it had some auto focus problems in video and stills, that were corrected in 1.2. Check the panasonic site to update it. 

Hope this helps.  </Content>

A bought this from Amazon two weeks ago. Read about it much, compared it to many others and finally decided to buy. My previous camera was Canon SD500 which was taking better images. My first impressions are disappointing. Yes, LCD screen was great, 10X Leica wide angle lens is amazing, 9MP is good, HD video is exceptional. What I ultimately expect from an excellent digital camera is taking excellent images which this camera lacks. Images are grainy especiallay indoor, but also outdoor. When I see the images in full size it is not hard to see grainy details which is irritating and making me get rid of this. If I was a US settler surely I would pack and return it back.

<Content>I thoroughly researched cameras before narrowing down the field to the Panasonic TZ5 and the Olympus 1010.  I was in the market for a camera to take on vacation to Peru - my selection criteria were: compact and easy to carry, powerful optical zoom, quick recovery time between pictures, and great looking scenery pics without noise.  After weeks of playing with both cameras at the local camera stores, I finally decided on the TZ5 due to the more powerful optical zoom.  Im happy to say that I have not regretted that decision for even a second.  As fashion is important to me too, I did want a camera that was cute.  The Olympus was an attractive camera in all colors, but the TZ5 was only available in silver at my local camera stores.  I was disappointed because the silver looked like an ugly kick around childrens camera to me.  I ordered it in blue and crossed my fingers.  LOVE THE BLUE!  Very attractive camera!  Ive also seen the black and thought that was quite attractive, too.

Now to performance.  I couldnt be happier with my pictures from my vacation.  I used many of the different settings and experimented.  I ended up with amazing sunset pictures, crystal clear pictures of Amazonian wildlife (even though they were moving quickly), breathtaking scenic views, and some really great fireworks pictures on July 4th.

Of course, the indoor low light pics have lots of noise.  That has been the case with every digital camera Ive even used.  So, I always use the flash indoors and theres no problem.

This camera is everything I was looking for and more.  Optical zoom on the video mode, AWESOME!  Too many features to mention!  I highly recommend this camera for a great small travel/everyday camera.</Content>

I am amazed that such an impressive lens fits inside such a small body. The 3 inch LCD screen is excellent for focusing shots however to experience a full impact of the images this camera is capable of you must view the images full size. I would recommend this camera for everyone from a novice that wants some room to expand to experienced photographers that are looking for a versatile point and shoot camera to supplement an existing DSLR.

I have played with many features of this camera, and I have several more yet to explore. So far, I have been most impressed with macro images that I have taken with this camera.  </Content>

<Content>Bought in the name of a friend, I had the chance to test it for some days.
For such a small form factor, the lens are very good and the image quality stunning; very nice to have a 28mm equivalent!
Very easy to use too, but unfortunately has few manual controls... but automatic modes and scenes generally do a good job in most conditions.
A fairly good buy.
Few negative points: due to metal case (I guess), it weights more than what you might expect and mainly on the opposite side of the grip... so I feel it a bit unbalanced in my hand.

I have had a few that were blurry and I had thought the image stabilizer was going to help prevent that but that is probably due to the user and not the camera. The screen is big and allows you to review photos easily. So far so good. I would recommend it for people that want a compact camera that still has bells and whistles.</Content>

<Content>I love this camera.  Its so easy to use.  The IA (Intelligent Auto) mode really works!  I was taking a picture of my son jumping up and down and it sensed movement and automatically adjusted its settings so the shot came out crystal clear.

There are many Scene settings and its nice that there is a Scene 1 and a a Scene 2 as a mode choice so that way you can switch quickly to saved settings that you use a lot.

Colors really turn out life-like.  The only negative I can say about this camera is that sometimes, you get some wierd coloration.  Im not sure what causes this, but it does happen.  There have been complaints about this on other posts, and I wouldnt be surprised if Panasonic will be coming out with a firmware update that fixes this.

The HD Movies look great on my 19inch computer screen, however I havent been able to get them to display on my plasma TV because I dont own one of those special cables.  One complaint, however is that sometimes the movies go in and out of focus.  
  
All said, this is a great Point and Shoot camera because it does all the work for you.  Easy to use and fantastic pictures, what else could you want in a Point and Shoot?  Hopefully, Panasonic will come out with a firmware update to correct the couple of issues I mentioned earlier.

<Content>The Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K 9.1 Megapixel digital camera is truly in a class by itself. It is the best compact digital camera I have seen so far, and strongly recommended it to a relative. My relative is enjoying hers now, and I have been quite impressed with the results. This camera performs superbly under both bright and low light conditions without a flash, certainly an impressive result for a camera as small and compact as this. Pictures have ample contrast and resolution, though tending slightly to the warm side. While she hasnt tried the HD video application yet, I wouldnt be surprised if the contrast and resolution is identical with still pictures. Without question, the Leica zoom lens is a fine performer and is a primary reason why you ought to buy this camera. Without indulging too much in hype, I can say with utmost certainty that Panasonic and Leica have hit a home run with this splendid little camera.</Content>

<Content>I wont bore you with lists of features and whatnot since many other reviewers have gone through this. I am by no means a camera person... in fact I know very little about photography. I just wanted a nice camera to shoot pictures next year in college. My camera arrived in the mail yesterday, and I immediately went out to play with it and shoot some pictures. It was VERY impressive. All of my pictures were very crisp and clear, and they looked like they were taken by a professional or something. They really looked THAT good, and this is coming from someone that knows jack squat about taking pictures.. ive always just been point and shoot kind of person. This camera just has a lot of things normal cameras dont have.. 10x zoom, HD VIDEO, wide lens, intelligent auto system. I think it is the ultimate point and shoot camera. My family has owned 4 digital cameras over the last 4 years or so, and this one by far is the best.

Also the HD VIDEO is incredible! I saw that its gotten a lot of negative reviews, but I was actually impressed by it. Maybe its because my camcorder at home is a little old I am more biased. But honestly, I will have no need for that camcorder anymore with the Lumix. I found the quality of the HD VIDEO to be pretty amazing and it looks really nice when watching it on the computer or camera. However, you will need to take contious focusing off because it constantly makes the video blurry then not blurry and back and forth.

<Content>After reading lots of reviews (including here) for a number of cameras in this price range, I decided to buy this camera. Though I havent tried all its features yet, I know I made the right choice. It is perfect for casual photography, since this particular Lumix gives accurate colors and offers lots of simple ways to adjust light, color, focus, shutter speed, and more. The 10x zoom is also a big plus, along with the large, bright viewing screen, which provides all the technical information you could need to take decent photos. In addition to all this, it takes pretty decent movies, including HD, widescreen format. Be aware, though, that those who plan to shoot lots of HD movies will need to buy an 8GB or 16GB SDHC card (preferably class 6). For those content with normal movie setting, a 4GB card will be sufficient. If you are considering the less-expensive Lumix DMC-TZ4K, the small additional cost (on Amazon, at least) for the TZ5K is money well spent, considering the differences in the two cameras. For my money, the larger LCD screen alone seals the deal.... A note to the few who have complained about audio quality in movies: First, Panasonic placed the microphone on the top left, which is less than ideal; one has to be careful not to cover it with the left index finger. Second, a high-quality, professional microphone is more than one should expect, as it would significantly increase the price of the camera, as well as its size. In short, this camera is highly recommended</Content>

<Content>Just got my camera and Ive been playing with it for a couple of hours now and I just have to say I love it!!!  It has a large variety of options that comes in handy if you want to take different types of pictures.  Its really fast as well, start up time is super quick, before I can even turn the camera over to look at the screen its already on.  The LCD screen is gorgeous, super clear and vibrant.  Video capture is great, but the mic. could be placed better, to allow for better sound, but its still very nice.  I have to say I thought the camera was thinner, but its still quite thin.  All in all I love it, Ive done digital photography in the past and I have to say Ive finally found a camera that is good enough to do what I want to do, without breaking the bank.</Content>

<Content>This camera has a lot of features that on paper seem quite good such had a wide range zoom lens, HD video and multiple aspect ratio picture modes. However, its just okay, not great in its performance. So, while it seems jam packed in features, some of these features are acceptable while others are marginal at best.

Images above ISO 200 look quite grainy and dull compared to other comparably priced point and shoot cameras Ive tried such as the Canon SD870IS. Also, the audio for videos is terrible, theres no other word for it. In a silent room you can hear a hissing sound and any voices sound muddy and unclear. This is a shame because it makes the HD video (or any resolution videos) out of this camera barely usable unless you want to shoot a silent video.

<Content>Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K 9MP Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)

Ive had and used my new TZ5 for a month. While Im not entirely comfortable with using the digital view screen instead of an optical view port, my pictures havent suffered at all. Accurate exposures, detailed images rich with natural color, all without any fussing at all has made taking pictures fun again. Im sure the various scene choices and all the other automation do help the camera make appropriate exposure and focus decisions. But, Id be hard pressed to prove it true or untrue. Everything simply looks great. 

Im recommending the TX5 to anyone who asks, and I do get questions because of that large cyclops-like lens and the attractive black body. Its not your average looking camera.</Content>

<Content>This camera is fantastic. The Intelligent Auto feature works very well. Though I suggest turning if off for nighttime photos and instead fiddling with whatever setting works best in your lighting environment.

The zoom is incredible for a camera of this price that doesnt require a lens. Youre not going to find a better zoom. Trust me. And it comes in extremely handy.

The video records well enough. The autofocus can cause some temporary blurring, but whatever, its a photo camera, not a video camera.

The LCD screen is very big. Ive had lots of people comment on how big it is. (The LCD screen.)

The only draw back is it is bigger than other similar cameras; as a guy, this is no problem, as it still fits comfortably in my jean pocket. If you are a girl and want something that is cute  tiny, this isnt for you.

I recommend getting the 16GB Transcend card with it. There is probably a link on this page. I bought it just because I was going on a two-week vacation and didnt want to have to worry about running out of space. For the price, you cant beat the convenience of knowing that even if you are shooting lots of video on vacation you probably wont run out of memory.

Battery life is fine. Id go out for a day with a full battery and take hundreds of pics and wouldnt have to worry about conserving battery. Just make sure you buy a spare though for if you have a day outing on a non-full battery. I bought one of the non-Panasonic spares here on Amazon and it was sufficient.

I highly recommend this product. I cant imagine a better camera in this price range. Its about as good as youll get without going SLR.</Content>

A little larger than my compact Canon, but, a lot more lens (10X vs. 3X).   Significantly smaller and easier to use than my Nikon 8800.

<Content>I have owned many digital cameras, and the DMC-TZ5 is the best yet. 
Practically NO SHUTTER LAG. With 10X optical zoom or even with the 64X zoom(digital enhanced), the mega optical image stabilization is absolutely amazing. I have not taken one blurry picture yet at either optical or digital max zoom.
The intelligent auto (iA) system is the best automatic system I have ever used, as it even selects the proper scene mode automatically (with almost perfect accuracy).
HD VIDEO at 720p is awesome for a point and shoot. My only complaint is that the microphone is not stereo, and is in the top of the camera, where it can easily and inadvertently be covered by a finger.
The camera is pocketable, and nearly as light in my hand as my tiny Casio exilim seven mpixel.
The battery is only 1000 mAh, but it lasts me about 3 hours of constant use (with sleep mode enabled - again - close to no lag for power up from sleep).
I have owned mine for about two weeks, and I am VERY SATISFIED because of the following features: the 10x zoom with ABSOLUTELY NO BLUR; an extremely intelligent automatic system; lcd that is viewable in direct sun; NO BLUR; NO BLUR; NO BLUR (not a typo - it is AMAZING).
If you are interested in this camera, go for it, you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!</Content>

<Content>A few years ago I bought my Mom a TZ1 and she absolutely loves it to this day.
I saw the new version TZ5, did a bit of research and bought one for myself.  

First thing you notice is the incredible screen on the back and the amazing Leica lens on the front.
Panasonic took an already great camera and made it even better with 9MP, HD movie capability  simpler menus.
 Menus can be accessed in either a quick or full version,...really handy! 

After testing both the iA  Standard picture mode (more manual settings) I found myself simply using the iA mode. 
(In both modes, the overall speed of the camera and its focusing is relatively fast)

The iA mode really is all youll need for the majority of your pictures,
it takes great point/Zoom/shoot pictures.
I could go on and on about the iA mode, all you need to know is that it works well.  Panasonic has done a very good job with this,....most impressive. 
*Leicas Wide Angle lens w/ 10X Zoom, including Image Stabilization are the TZ5s greatest attributes.

Playback on the HD level LCD screen has to be seen in person,..WOW!!

Speaking of HD, you can shoot movies @ 30fps in 720P,
 (its really 30fps because you can see the fps in RivaTuner software)
With the TZ5 you can shoot 2GB if movies at a time, so depending on your quality level, thats around 9~15min. filming. 
~ If the auto focus came On only after you Zoom, (for that refocusing moment) it would make movies even better. 
 My C.AF is Off on movies,... still great!


I noticed on night/flash photos you need to be aware of your finger is on the front, as not to partially cover the flash, just a heads up.

Overall, I highly recommend the Panasonic TZ5, its as close to a perfect camera I can think of,..
 it really is the pocket SLR.

ENJOY!


Also:
to go along with the TZ5, I have a 4GB SanDisk Extreme III card, BoxWave screen protector, Case LOGIC TBC-3 camera bag
  spare battery.

<Content>After quite a bit of research I chose this camera because of its 10x zoom and Panasonics and Leicas reputations.  The intelligent automatic mode makes the camera pretty much fool-proof.  23 scene modes allow you to use pre-set exposure modes depending on the scene (action, candlelight, etc.).  The camera is not quite pocket size, but its easy to hold, and I dont think youll find a lens like this on any of the tiny cameras.  </Content>

<Content>Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5S 9MP Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)This is my 2nd Lumix camera. I have used the older one Mod LC43 for several years and liked the Leica lens. I wanted some additional features so started looking at new cameras. The features that I wanted seem to only be on large size cameras and I wanted one that I could put in my pocket. Finally went back to Lumix and researched the TZ5 and it had most of the features that I wanted including the size and the Leica lens. I talked to a Panasonic Lumix representative by phone and learned that the new software in this camera would do even more things than I had expected so I bought one. Since I had been a previous Lumix user , learning the new TZ5 camera was a snap. The new BIG 3 inch LCD is awesome and easy to see even in reduced lighting. The flash reaches out 2 or 3 times farther than my old camera. The Anti-Shake feature really works well. Taking progressive pictures works very well and is fun to use. The new Photo Program that comes with the camera does a great job on enhancements and cataloging your photos. I am extremely happy with this camera and even convinced my neighbor to buy one. Well worth the money and easy to use. Great camera.</Content>

<Content>Replaced a (lost) TZ3 with this new TZ5.  Picture quality is excellent, very sharp and clear, and simplified controls are an improvement over the TZ3.  Best feature of the camera is definitely the wide angle lens coupled with the 10x optical zoom - it makes taking a wide variety of shots (landscapes to close-ups) very easy.  The 3 screen is incredibly bright.  Only one minor complaint - Id prefer a separate viewfinder to make it easier to preview shot in bright sunlight.  Aside from that minor issue, a great camera.  Would highly recommend.  </Content>

<Content>Through an unfortunate turn of events, I had to replace my DMC-TZ3, and the only luck of the situation was the timely introduction of the new TZ5. I havent had the time to fully explore and learn all the tools this camera holds, but here are some key feature changes and improvements and why I came back for another TZ: 
New with TZ5:
The switch from camera mode to view mode has been taken off the wheel on top of the camera to a more convenient seperate switch on the back of the camera adjacent to the display. Video quality rocks, at a purported 720p! Beware you will need a minimum 10Mbps SD card, especially for highest video settings 6 X 9 - 30 fps. I found some 8GB Sandisk 133x (20mbps) Extreme III SD cards that work great. This camera seems to handle low light quite a bit better than the TZ3, but still a weekness, it appears. I still need some learn time with the scene settings, but have found that it will do long exposures once you understand how. Not sure the TZ3 could ever manage that, and any low light shot I could ever muster was very grainy with the TZ3. 
Why buy the TZ line? 
The primary feature that brought me to Panasonic and the TZ3 originally was looking for a pocket digital with a wide angle lens. Getting in more people close up, or more scenery in long shots has always appealed to me. Adding to that a great 10X Zoom that never leaves you wanting, and a 3 high quality display - great for showing your pictures as well as shooting, and you have a great package. On top of those core features, Panasonic has loaded a ton of features for both the novice and more advanced user to give you an incredible machine that can still fit (barely) into a pocket. </Content>

<Content>I bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5 as a replacement for an ageing Canon S60. Initially, I hesitated in this choice because of the lack of full manual controls, but the TZ5 lived up to the glowing reviews.

The centrepiece of the camera is the wonderfully sharp Leica lens with a 28mm - 280mm span(35 mm equivalent) that covers all possible shooting situations from wide angle to telephoto. I travel a lot, and often use the wide angle setting to take pictures of buildings and landscapes and the telephoto setting to zoom in on the details. The Optical Image Stabilization feature allows you to take pin-sharp pictures even at full zoom without any camera shake.

The camera is solidly built, with a metal construction and a good weighty feel. The huge 3 LCD screen takes up most of the back and this is a real beauty, bright and clear even in sunlight and with a very high resolution.

Operating the TZ5 is simplicity itself, with the full auto iA setting taking care of every aspect, even analysing the scene and selecting approriate settings such as portait or landscape. For greater manual control, there is a programmable auto setting where you can adjust various parameters and a large number of scene modes. But on the whole, the full auto setting works well, and I expect to leave it there for most situations. 

The Panasonic image processing engine does an excellent job of removing imperfections, leaving almost no post-processing to be done to have print-ready pictures.

As an added bonus, the camera has a 720p HD video mode, useful for occasional video taking - but the memory card will fill up fast!

In summary, the TZ5 is strongly recommended as an advanced point-and-shoot compact camera, ideal for travelling. </Content>

<Content>OK, Ive had a couple of weeks now to play around with this camera and I am 100% satisfied.  I have owned a number of digital cameras over the years (lets see...Ricoh, Kodak, Canon, Casio, Nikon...even tried an Olympus once) and this camera is the best of them all.  Sure, advancing technology contributes to that overall sense of best, but the large lcd display, among other things, just blows me away.  The camera is a tad bulky but that is to be expected with a 10x zoom.  There are so many incredible features packed into this little jewel of a camera.  I am sorry for those who find/found it disappointing.  Maybe you just got a lemon.  I honestly believe this will be the camera that will keep me happy for many years to come.   

i just got this camera yesterday...i charged up the battery and starting playing with the camera late last night.  I already know I adore this thing.  The zoom, the feel of the unit, the menus, wow.  Oh, and I suppose the pictures are kind of important too?  :)  Ive only taken a few but they are wonderful.  There are lots of picture modes left to try...I love taking sepia tone photos so I know that will be a blast for me.  Thanks, Amazon, for bringing it to me at a price no one else can touch!  Amazon ROCKS.  So its early Sunday morning so hopefully I can find lots of time to play with my new toy.  :)</Content>

I was really surprised with how good inside photos in low light came out on just the Auto setting. I really disliked my older Sony camera and had stopped taking pictures because I never got anything good with it.  Obviously the technology has improved a lot since my last digital camera purchase, but I really think this is a top-notch camera. Im just an amateur, take family photos, kind of photographer and this camera by far meets and exceeds the requirements I have.</Content>

<Content>Pros

Great lens (wide and long)
Sturdy build quality
Excellent ergonomics
Excellent image quality up to ISO 200
Very easy to use
Nice size -- substantial, but fits in a shirt pocket


Cons

Would benefit from more manual controls
Bundled software is not very good
ISO 400+ image quality is not great
Does not work nearly as well indoors as outdoors


I wanted a big-zoom camera with a relatively small body.  The choice came down to the TZ5 or the Canon SX1000IS.  Really, I was sold within 30 seconds of picking up the TZ5.  It has a metal body.  The camera is not heavy per se, but it feels substantial.  The Canon felt flimsy in comparison.  (The Canon is made of cheap, slick plastic, and I did not like the grip.)  The TZ5 controls are perfectly laid out for me, and I had no trouble getting a good grip.  Also, the TZ5 menus are well-organized and intuitive.

Having used the TZ5 for about a month, I have been very pleased with the performance and image quality.  The image stabilization is excellent, as my pictures are almost never blurry at lower ISOs.  I always use the automatic white balance, and I havent had any problems yet.  The exposure is good, but I do use the exposure compensation and auto bracketing functions a lot.

My only major complaint about the TZ5 is that it would be better if it had more manual controls.  In particular, I would like to be able to override the auto focus, which sometimes (especially in macro mode) back-focuses instead of focusing on the intended subject.

Finally, the bundled software is fine for cropping pictures, but otherwise its not very useful.  For instance, there is a sharpening function, but it doesnt actually make my pictures look sharper, it just adds a sparkly grain to them.  

In conclusion, the TZ5 is a great automatic camera.  I believe it is the only camera that offers such a wide/ long lens in a pocketable form.  The vast majority of my shots come out well, so the lack of manual controls doesnt detract too much from the cameras overall usefulness and quality.  </Content>

<Content>Zoom x10 with image stabilizer - great! (even x13.5 with 5M resolution)
Resolution 9M - sounds good, but quite meaningless with the noise level.
Intelligent auto mode actually works very good, saves much time.
Sound is noisy, maybe due to the upward location of the microphone.
Compactness makes a big difference, you just carry it with you any time.
Video size is huge due to the awkward MJPEG format, I convert to MPEG4.
Lack of reclining screen is quite inconvenient in difficult positions.
Overall, a great camera for any condition, just dont use high ISO values.

After a day of fully reading the manual and having the camera right next to me to see what the manual was describing - I was ready to go.  Ive been out now shooting pictures with this camera for 3 straight weeks with my tripod and have had excellent results.  Im a tad bummed however that you cannot set the aperture when taking 15sec, 30sec or even 60sec exposures :(  this means that you can only really take open exposures of night time scenarios.  Also, the colors this camera captures are great for $300 - but nothing compared to an SLR so dont fool yourself.  Lightweight, convenient, beautiful, and quick/responsive AND a FANTASTIC ZOOM is all I can really say for this 4 star camera.  E N J O Y ! </Content>

<Content>Ill keep it short.  

Ive gone through 5 digital cameras in as many years (Broken, lost, stolen, upgraded)

The only complaint I and many have about this camera is the auto-focus in movie mode.  It constantly refocuses making for bad video, so my recomendation is to simply turn it off, then when ready to take a video, set the zoom to about where you want it and start recording.  Ive zoomed to about 30 feet away while shooting my kids, and they came up close to a foot or two and the video still looks pretty sharp.  No problem!

Oh yeah I dropped the camera from about 4-5 feet a week after I got it and... nothing happened.  Great.

Enjoy this camera.

<Content>I bought this camera a couple of months ago primarily because it was one of the very few still cameras that also recorded movies at 720p resolution.  (A couple more have been released since.)  My previous camera, a Fuji F700 had just died after a long and fruitful life and I was looking to upgrade.  This camera seemed to be just the ticket.  I wanted a camera with great stills, of course, but also good quality video, because I dont want to carry two pieces of equipment around.  This camera delivers on both ends.  

Lets start with the pros.  The pictures are very good, I dont see any problems with them.  The 3 screen is very sharp and really nice.  The 10x zoom is terrific.  The camera is a nice comfortable size.  

Battery life is pretty amazing.  Although I bought two backup batteries, I find that I dont have to use them at all.  Also, the charger, with foldup electrical prongs, is tiny and does a great job recharging in 90 minutes or so.  Easy enough to throw the charger in the suitcase as well.  

The cons are not too bad, but annoying and simple to fix.  After shooting a still picture, the camera, of course, shows you a still of what youve just shot.  However, when you turn the camera sideways to shoot, say, a picture of the Eiffel Tower, the playback will flip the shot so that you dont have to turn the camera.  Why have that gorgeous 3 screen if youre not going to use it?  Ill readily admit this is a minor annoyance, to be sure.  This is the default mode, and after some searching in the cameras memory, it can be changed to that the playback mode doesnt flip the picture.  

When shooting video, the cameras default is to have continuous focus.  Even if youre not moving the camera much, the camera will continue to go in and out of focus while shooting video, blurring everything.  This is more annoying than the picture flip I mentioned.  This is also correctable in the menu.  

The third annoyance is the cameras memory reading ability.  I have an 8 GB card, which is more than ample memory for anything.  In fact, the camera can shoot about 33 minutes of video on the highest-quality setting - 720p, 30 frames/sec.  However, when you go to shoot video, the camera only reads that there are 8 minutes and 30 seconds of video.  This is no big deal; however, after you shoot, say, 1 minute of video, and the counter counts down to 7 minutes and thirty seconds, then you press the shutter release again to stop recording, the reading changes right back to 8 minutes and 30 seconds, the maximum amount of memory recognizable by the camera.  This makes you think that the video didnt get saved.  

This thinking that the video didnt get saved is reinforced when you go to play it back, leading to my final annoyance, the cameras integration with my Panasonic Viera plasma TV.  I didnt buy a Panasonic camera for this purpose, but as long as I did, I figured, what the hey?  The TV has an SD slot in back, so you can take your memory card out of the camera and stick it directly into the TV and have a slide show of your pictures.  Sounds good, right?  But it doesnt play back video through the card slot.  

To play back the 720p video on the 720p plasma TV, you have to use cables, and connect it to one of the inputs.  The problem with this is that the cables provided arent even composite cables - theyre the standard red, white, and yellow - and this degrades the video quality.  This is just plain dumb, dumb, dumb.  The only way you can look at the video in all its HQ glory is on your computer.  

All in all, these are minor annoyances, Ill admit.  But they do keep me from giving the camera a 5-star rating.  </Content>

<Content>i have this camera 5 stars. not because i think its the best camera around; it isnt. i have a Nikon D70 and it produces nicer images than the TZ5. you just arent going to find a point and shoot that can produce what a nice DSLR can. with that out of the way, the TZ5 is terrific given its limitations. wide angel and 10x zoom AND HD video??? seriously, all of this for $269 or so. thats incredible. 

i can fit this camera in my pocket, but it does bulge my pocket out enough that it looks awkward. i ended up ordering a lowepro 30 something or other that has a belt clip. but this is still 100 times more portable for every day use than my D70. well be off to Europe for a few months soon and i wanted something that could be out of the way until i need it and this TZ5 is the best camera i could find. i spent a lot of time viewing sample images, reading reviews and checking prices. i am very pleased with this purchase. i did buy a clear screen protector and id recommend that for anyone getting this camera (or any other camera with a big display on back).</Content>

<Content>I bought and returned this camera within 29 days from Amazon, they were great about the return and it was easy to do online. The reason I made the purchase in the first place was to replace my old Canon SD200, which still works great, its just old and the water housing was getting beat. I figured I would buy the Panasonic based on specs and the fact there would be an available water housing for it. When I did make the purchase, I was not able to get the water housing for it yet, I expected to wait a little while, but took the camera to the beach and took great surf shots from a distance using  the 10X optical zoom. The pictures turned out just OK, when zoomed in on them, I noticed they were a little grainy, (first gripe). I next took the camera to my kids school play which was in a dimly lit auditorium, suffice to say, this camera does not do well in low light and I didnt get some of the shots I wanted. I played with the settings but could not get this thing to cooperate. (second gripe) Finally, after having a couple of opportunities to try this out, HD Video included, I was not impressed and began to miss my little SD200. My three or four year old Canon was a lot faster, smaller, and took better pictures, so I decided that I didnt need 10X optical zoom (I wanted small to begin with) and that I sacrificed to many things to have 10X optical zoom and HD video and returned it, promptly going out and buying a Canon SD870 and a water housing the same day from my favorite little mom and pop camera shop down in Encinitas. My Canon blows the Panasonic away in all aspects. I also want to say, the Panasonic required a proprietary cable to hook up to the computer instead of your standard mini usb cable, which I found annoying. I will never buy another Panasonic camera again and instead stick with what I know and has never failed me, my Canon.

<Content>I bought this camera the week before we left on a Mediterranean cruise.  I was looking for a camera that was small enough to carry in a pocket, yet not so small I would have to put on my glasses everytime I used it.  The 10X tele lense was also a drawing card, as we would be doing a lot of touring and taking some shots at a distance.
The camera arrived 5 days before we left, and I reviewd the manual on the plane flight. This proved enough as the camera operation was intuitive and easy to follow.
We enjoyed this camera from the first photo to the last (about 380 pictures).  It took great pictures, and the auto focus and face recognition worked great most of the time.  The 3 most common adjustments, zoom, backlight compensation, and force flash off are convenient and quick to select.  I took a lot of flash off photos (inside museums) and the pictures were surprisingly good.
The telephoto was invaluable in recording some of the landscape and architectual details of buildings.
I rarely used any setting other than the intelligent auto, and it took care of most scenes with great clarity and exposure.  I took several videos and found them acceptable.  This is where I found the only negative: the zoom apparatus makes a bad squeeking sound as recorded on the video. Sounds like a slow moving rusty door. 
We met several other passengers who had the same camera and everyone thought it was great.
It got a little damp in Naples and Rome where it rained most of the day.  However, it never missed a beat or presented a moisture problem.
Overall, I am very impressed and will use this camera over my Nikon D50 for most casual situations.

<Content>Im an owner of 2 DSLRs and various film single lens reflex cameras but I wanted something small and portable that I could take with me everyday. After scouring the adds for PointShoot digital cameras, I settled on the Panasonic TZ5. I got the camera in the mail a couple of days ago and so far, Im not dissapointed.
 
The camera is really well built, but the tripod socket is made of plastic and the door to the USB Ports is made of some real flimsy plastic(Why Panasonic decided to do that, I dont know ?) Everything else is metal.

There is not that many controls, or switches (thank god), but the Menu system is, pretty extensive. I kind of like the weight of it, makes it feel like you are carrying a precise instrument, not a plastic toy you got at the discount store. The Leica brand on the lens certainly adds to the prestige. 

I havent taken many pictures with this camera yet, but from what I can tell so far, the images are very sharp and natural in color, if you keep the ISO below 400. Even above an ISO of 400, maybe up to an ISO of 800 the pictures are still very acceptable. 

What I really love about this camera is the ease of operation. I only had to refer to the all-English and well written manual a few times to learn how to operate it. Navigating the menus is really simple and intuitive once you learn how to interpret some of the icons. 

I would have given this camera 5 stars instead of 4 if it had at least one Manual function and a viewfinder and if the lens was a little faster. Not being acustomed to composing pictures on an LCD instead of a viewfinder can be a little daughting, however you can display a Grid on the LCD panel to aid you in the composition another value addition. 

The camera came without a carrying case, or flash card, but you can purchase these items as accessories separately. I purchased a Lowenpro case that BH and Amazon advertise on their websites, rather than getting the Panasonic semi-hard case which seemed a little bulky. Nevertheless, The Lowenpro case is not exactly sleek and slim either. I also purchased an 8gig card so I would have enough space for videos.  

If you want to remain anonymous I would recomend placing the camera inside a jacket pocket since its to bulky to fit inside a shirt pocket. 

All in all I am very satisfied with this camera. It takes great pictures, it looks nice, it takes videos with sound, it is easy to operate, its quiet, the deceptively small flash is pretty powerful and produces nice even lighting.

One thing I noticed that in automatic mode the flash fires almost every time even in bright sunlight. Good thing you can force the flash not to fire through the Menu.

All in all this camera is like my cell phone. Small enought to carry with me everywhere. Now if I see a something that looks like it might make a great picture, I could just reach inside my jacket pocket and fire away. This is something I always wanted to do. </Content>

<Content>Like a number of others, I researched digital cameras on-line and in stores for about 3 months before I decided to buy ...I looked at Canon, Sony, Nikon, and Panasonic, and made made a great choice with the TZ5.

Im assuming that because youre reading this review you know all or most of the TZ5s features, so I wont belabor those except to say that they are great and work well.  I really like the camera for several reasons...first, it is relly simple to use.  Even my wife takes great pictures simply by using the Auto/Intelligent mode.  I prefer the normal mode, and I find the camera gives me multiple options that are all easy to use mainly because the menu system is so logical and well thought out.  The only features that are missing are aperture and shutter priority.  Youve got everything else...i.e. W/B, ISO, saturation, exposure control, etc.  These can be accessed easily and quickly (unlike Sony and Canon) to make manual adjustments for shooting.

The 10X zoom and electric zoom to 16.9X are terrific as is the 3 LCD screen.  Connecting the camera to view pictures on your TV is a snap, and the pictures show beautifully in 16:9 mode at near high definition.  Images viewed on my computer are really sharp, and the few prints Ive made so far are incredible...as good as my old Minolta SLR with a 1.4 lens...thats saying something.
My one complaint is that because the camera is smaller than I am used to, I have to be careful that my right forefinger doesnt cover the flash when Im shooting indoors.  I suspect that will get better the more I get used to the size.  Also, I found a small carrying case with neckstrap and room for an extra battery to be very helpful.  For memory, I bought  a SanDisk 4GB SDHC card with the MicroMate reader.  It seems to work extremely well, and the reader downloads pictures to my computer very quickly and easily.
This is my first Panasonic Lumix camera, and so far, I am very impressed.  If my wife commandeers this camera from me, Id buy another Panasonic...maybe the FX18 to complement the TZ5.</Content>

<Content>Great camera that is easy to use. The menus are simple and the image quality is great. The LCD Screen size is fantastic and looks sharp. The 10x optical zoom alows me to get great pictures with depth of field.

My only grip is that the audio quality for the video is not so great and the mic is located on the top where I usually put my finger. But the audio of most other cameras that my friends have are about the same. Its just a shame because the 720p video looks fantastic.

One option that I would have liked included would have been a longer exposure. The most this camera does is 2 seconds and I would have liked it to go up to 15, but thats not so important.

A second option would be to have camera control when connected to a computer, but obviously that really isnt important for most users. </Content>

<Content>I did a great deal of research before purchasing this camera because I dont have the time or money that some people apparently have to be doing the eBay revolving door thing. What I came to realize is that, disappointingly, there isnt a clearly superior compact or ultracompact camera out there. There are only cameras with greater or lesser compromises and the trick is finding the one you can live with. The Lumix TZ5 was a good travel companion and turned out to have few flaws. 

Since it irritates me when people say that they do a great deal of research and then never share it (doesnt that irritate you?), here are some of the cameras I ruled out based on my (maybe not your) criteria:
Fujifilm FinePix F100fd (difficult menu design, pink banding issue), Canon PowerShot SD890 IS (reported awful handling and poorly designed controls), Casio Exilim Card EX-S10 (No image stabilization, very slim, picture quality ok, weak zoom, tiny controls), Casio Exilim EX-S880 (No image stabilization, reported poor image quality), Olympus Stylus 850 SW (reportedly poor video shooting, poor battery life), Pentax Optio V10 (No image stabilization), Casio EX-Z1080 (Reduced pixels compared to others, 38mm starting range), Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX55 (Reportedly falls short on image quality, no viewfinder, larger), Ricoh Caplio R7 (No optical viewfinder, very noisy, some barrel distortion when fully extended, poor customer service?, reported quality mediocre), Pentax Optio A40 (Reportedly poor autofocus), and Canon PowerShot A470 (No viewfinder, no image stabilization, weak zoom).

Unfortunately, doing all this research meant I didnt get the Lumix TZ5 till right before my trip to Amsterdam - I was literally reading the manual on the plane. I dont recommend this, but it does serve as a good crash test for what the camera could (and could not) do out-of-the-box. 

As you probably know, this isnt an ultracompact but it is not as big as some reviewers make out. Could fit in a large pocket but it is rather heavy and unprotected in that environment so I got a LowePro case for it that sat on my belt. Worked well, allowed for extra batteries and SD card, and access was quick for candid shots. 

Things that worked well:
* The Intelligent Auto mode worked pretty well for most situations. I suggest studying the exposure compensation settings since I had to use these often in high contrast and full sun situations.
* One handed operation works well. 
* Menu system was pretty intuitive for basic functions. 
* Zoom is amazing and E.Zoom setting was very useful. Be sure to read how to use the extended optical zoom which lets you go out to 16.9x at reduced picture quality (I believe you have to have picture quality set at max 9MB and this is then reduced to 3MB). I didnt use the digital zoom. 
* The screen is gorgeous and the playback is amazing - many people commented on this. 
* Taking video is pretty easy, though I would have preferred a button rather than having to rotate a dial. Be careful on playback to distinguish between what is a still picture and what is video - I accidentally deleted some video because I thought they were poor still shots, rather than the start of the video.  
* If the dial is accidentally rotated, the camera will not let you take a picture until you correctly choose an actually setting.  
* Fairly quick start up - not stellar but not bad. 
* Can set up something called Travel Date, which will organize pictures by 1st, 2nd, 3rd day. This was useful when sharing pictures and to help you remember the chronology of the trip. 
* You can zoom while taking video, although more slowly than with still shots. 

What didnt work well: 
* No matter what you read, the pretty LCD screen is no replacement for a view finder even when you use the Auto Power LCD option to compensate. In daylight, even on the brightest setting, the screen washes out. Another problem I had was I had to remove my glasses to compose on the screen, which was a hassle with rapidly-moving candid shots. This was the biggest disappointment and I took off one star for this.
* Certain functions of the camera will only work in certain settings. For example, you can only set the self-timer for 10 sec in IA mode, histograms cannot be displayed in IA mode, exposure settings can only be used in normal mode, extended optical zoom cannot be used in motion picture mode, etc. It can be frustrating, and you can miss a good shot, if you dont have all that memorized. I imagine all cameras are like this, but thought I would mention it since we are discussing an out-of-the-box experience.
* The door to the sockets on the right-hand side comes open easily (does not lock closed but only snaps shut), which is a hassle at times. I am concerned that it will snap off one day. 
* In my opinion, the flash is underpowered. 

Overall, I am happy with the TZ5 and impressed with the pictures and video it produced - especially since I had so little experience with it. My friend, who is a film maker by trade, was also impressed with the camera. It is bigger than I would have liked, but the trade off for a 10X zoom was worth it for me. 

Do get an extra battery - I went through both batteries in 4 hours of shooting, mostly stills but some video. Big hassle to run out of juice in the middle of your day. A SD Extreme III 8GB was recommended in some reviews and it worked well for me, especially with shooting video. In doing research about buying a camera, one of the most helpful websites I found was the What Camera Should I Buy? forum at the Digital Camera Resource Page - [...]
In looking at the reviews here on Amazon for the TZ5, be aware that they are organized by color, so check each color for information about this camera. </Content>

I love this camera. I had a Canon S2IS that takes great photos, but is too cumbersom to carry around when Im traveling. This Lumix fits in a small case on my belt.. or in my purse. It takes great photos and is really easy to use.. very user friendly. I have had it a couple of months now and taken some fun family pics as well as some competition pics for my camera club... does all very well and easy.  The only thing Id change is to give it a view finder. The screen is very nice.. big.. but gets glare outdoors and at night and I cant see what Im shooting.... and of course if it came in pink... I bought the blue because it wasnt black or silver.. but pink would suite me better.</Content>

<Content>The TZ5 is a marked improvement over the previous TZ3.  Although the extended zoom is only marginally better, the metering and ease of use is significantly better.  The only way to made this compact packed with great features camera better is to make each setting unchanged by any other setting alteration. e.g. Make the exposure bracket stay on until you shut it off.  And the bracket setting may be on on one setting and not in another.  The clarity of the photos is outstanding.  The lens system superlative.  In short, a small camera with big capabilities and Quality.</Content>

<Content>Pros:

3. Partial HD quality pictures and video (Not sure of this, read on why)
4. Awesome optical zoom. I could capture clear small text (about 16 Aerial font size) from 30 feet away!

Con:
1. Pictures of vibrant colors taken using iA (intelligent Auto) mode (most frequently used more) with finest quality available on this camera, appear grainy when seen on computer at actual size. In fact you can already see minute grains of the taken picture when viewed in zoom mode on the camera itself. This compares very badly with the images I have taken with my old Canon S230. I am returning this Panasonic camera. I will buy a Canon with similar optical zoom capability of this Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5S.

It was fairly easy to use with little instruction, although I have yet to read the entire operating instructions (100 + pages) and probably am not aware of all the available features.  Battery recharged in a couple of hours and 4 GB memory card allowed me to take 350 photos with memory to spare. Over all, I was very pleased with this product.  Amazon service was outstanding.

<Content>Ordered the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5S for the convenience of having a point  shoot (PS) while on vacation in San Diego. I usually shoot with my Nikon D50 and LOVE it, but the girth of a DSLR is often too much when all Im wanting to do is preserve some memories. For several years my PS was a 2001 vintage Kodak ... very basic. 

Ive got to say, as someone who loves to take photos and is pretty good at it, that this Lumix blows me away in how far PS technology has advanced in the past several years. If you are a pure amateur, just set this rascal on a max ISO of 400 and iA setting and start snapping! Its virtually foolproof. The most advanced auto mode I have ever used on a PS.

The HD video capability is nice. Its not going to give you videos of the quality you might expect from a dedicated vidcam, but this IS a PS. Not having to carry around two separate cams is worth the trade-off in quality if you are just chronicling vacation stuff. 

Build quality is top flight and very sturdy. The viewing screen is brilliant. The images taken with this cam are very, very good.

**Bottom line : a very high BUY recommendation for the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5S.**</Content>

<Content>My primary camera is a DSLR, but I keep a pointshoot for my wife/kids to use, as a backup camera, and for daily trips around town. I used a Canon SD700, until my kids hid it and forgot where they put it ;-}

Anyway, what I wanted is something small that can handle the beating of everyday family use and still produce great pictures. I did a fair amount of research and selected the TZ5 based on its balance of good reviews, price, and zoom/features. After two weeks of shooting with it, here are my current impressions: 

Pros: 
- Image quality is great. Not as sharp as DSLR, but I think better than my prior Canon SD700. Also, colors are natural  attractive. Very pleased with the results that it captures
- The face-detection/focusing system is really really cool. Im not a big all auto shooter, but the TZ5s face detection is so effective that I find myself setting the camera in iAuto mode most of the time. 
- Good control placement, menus, and setting flexibility. 
- The 10x zoom is wonderful. A good range from wide angle to telephoto, gives lots of shooting options. 

Cons: 
- Body is considerably larger than the Canon. While better for larger hands, the size makes the TZ5 harder to tote. The metal body feels solid, but as a result, its heavy. Overall, the TZ5 will not fit comfortably in a pocket, so be ready for a belt case or the need to drop it into your purse. 
- Shutter lag is bad - almost like it was designed in 2002! Ok, maybe its not THAT long, but the lag is noticeable and causes missed shots. 
- Battery life is pretty horrible. Using the huge zoom on the unit, I cant even get through a single 4GB card (about 600 shots). I almost never use the flash, but assume performance would be much worse. Its worth getting a 2nd battery until Panasonic makes the TZ5 more efficient.

Havent found a perfect everyday camera yet (at any price), so theres still an opportunity for some manufacturer to meet the need! That said, this unit is pretty good and Im happy with it. Also, LOVE the option to buy in different colors (I chose blue, and am very happy with it) - why has it taken so long for us to get more options than just black or silver??

Enjoy  happy shooting!

<Content>Firstly, be aware that this is a point-and-shoot camera.  I had read too many reviews where the only negatives were comparing it to digital SLRs.  I think there is some confusion that because it has a 10x zoom that it is a full-blow SLR.  Not so.  It is like any other compact digital in many of its functions.  It is only about 1/2 inch thicker than my Casio due to the lens, so it fits nicely in your palm, fanny pack, or pocket.

Secondly, the 10x zoom is AWESOME.  Other features, like the image stabilizer, makes the Lumix TZ5 zoom even better (if thats possible).   

Also nice is the 28mm wide-angle Leica lens - quite a professional addition to a point-and-shoot.

Other awesome features are the intelligent exposure, intelligent scene selector and burst shooting.  

Menu is easy to learn and use (we didnt even read the instructions).

For a die-hard compact digital camera geek like myself, the pictures this camera produces look excellent.  Be assured, the color is MUCH sharper than in the examples above (perhaps due to compression by amazon).

I had read that the battery door and tripod mount were plastic and flimsy for such a heavy-duty camera.  For sure, plastic seems like a cheap addition to such a sturdy camera.  But I havent noticed either being flimsy. Of course, knowing they are plastic makes me handle them with a little more care.

The LED screen is LARGE and automatically adjusts in brightness according to your environment.

Another feature I appreciate (for a point-and-shoot) is the little rubberized ridge on the front right - just perfect for your fingers in taking quick one-handed shots.

Lastly, if you want to see this camera in action, go to [...] and search on panasonic lumix tz5.  You will be impressed.</Content>

<Content>When the time came to replace our 5-year-old Sony Cybershot I did lots of research all the while intending to buy another Sony.  When I came across this model I was intrigued. Most of the cameras I had considered touted many features I would never use.  This camera offered everything on my checklist with a unique added bonus in this price range----A REAL lens with incredible zoom and wide shot capabilities.
I bought it about three weeks ago and could not be happier.  We have taken many photos and videos during the final weeks of the school year and I am blown away by the difference in quality VS our old Sony.  Low-light photos are brilliant.  Isnt technology wonderful?!!?!! </Content>

Bad

1. Poor picture quality in low light, probably due to the small sensor size?

</Review>
<Review>
<DocID>B0011Z44UA-416</DocID>
<Content>I came from a Sony DSC-V1 which was a terrific camera in its day. Its downfall was a tiny little LCD screen and a limited zoom range that ended at 35mm on the wide end. I wanted a camera that went down to at least 28mm and had a clear, large LCD. I looked at the Canon 870IS and the Nikon P-80 but settled on this. Why? The Canons LCD was not as clear as the Lumix and it had a limited zoom range on the top end. And, to be honest, it didnt have some of the bells and whistles that the Lumix did. The Nikon was really not pocketable and has been getting horrible reviews all over the internet since its recent introduction (Amazon, DPReview.com, etc.). It seems that Nikon really knows how to do dSLRs but comes up way short in the PS category. I also briefly considered the Fuji 100SD but rejected it due to well known problems with pink banding and purple fringing. If you like to do a lot of low light, higher ISO photography though, the Fuji should be on your very short list. 

I know a number of people have complained that the TZ5 is not as small as they thought/hoped it would be. Cmon guys, this thing has a 10x zoom that goes down to 28mm!!! Something with those capabilities is never going to be the size of a credit card! And the thing for me is that I just cant stand geometric distortion and the Panasonic/Leica is a real champ in this regard. Theres nothing worse than that horrible barrel distortion you see in so many wide angle lenses. This one has none of that. The trade off is that it gets iffy at higher ISOs. You can effectively prevent this by setting the camera to never let the ISO get above, say 400. The camera allows you to do this. The Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) is really superb as are the exposure options. And, of course, the face recognition is a great new development that Panasonic has implemented quite well in this camera. 

Now to its video capabilities. Itll shoot 720p HD video in 16:9 which is awesome if you have a HD TV which is, of course, 16:9. Just be sure to turn off auto-focus when in video mode or the camera will constantly be hunting for the right focus. Its depth of field is excellent so itll be in focus most of the time anyway. 

Just a couple of nits. The low light assist lamp is not terribly effective (nowhere near as good as the one on my Sony DSC-V1) and the camera sometimes takes a second or two to find the right focus in low light. And I wish there was a way to more easily control/allow for long shutter exposures as I love night photography. As it is, you have to set the camera to Starry Night (one of the scene modes) to get shutter speeds longer than 1 second. Not that big a deal and  certainly a minor criticism of such an excellent overall camera. 

Oh, and one final thing...the build quality is superb. Everything about this camera just shrieks quality. Great job Panasonic. All at a price point of $300. Incredible!</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera following the enthusiastic reviews that seemed to be everywhere on the web. It has all I wanted: good parts (the Leica lens were a good selling point), good zoom (10x!!!), decent video (I already own a camcorder) and the wide-angle (very imprtant).

It is also easy to use. Has both point-and-shoot capability (been using it a lot, especially with the pre-set scenes and auto-selection of scenes and loving it) and some manual settings to play around with when Im in gadgety-mood (but Im not a photographer, and dont know what half of those things mean... will learn, hopefully!) 

The zoom is outstanding: I took a picture of my mother from a distance of approx. 20 meters, and I can zoom to see what time her watch is showing.

On the down side, I must admit that it is a lot heavier and bulkier than I thought it would be (or indeed, than I realized when I looked at it at the store). It does not fit completely in the palm of your hand and is certainly not light-weight. Most reviews say its perfect for travelling and will fit in your pocket... makes me wonder what kind of pockets people use... It certainly wont fit in an average jacket pocket.. in fact, most cameras at the store could fit in the cheap no-brand cases on sale, but the TZ5 couldnt.

Im starting to wonder whether I shouldnt have gone for the FX35 instead. The FX35 seems to have less features, and slightly worse images (but difference noticeable only in the lab), but looks a lot more portable and lightweight (also cuter design, but who really cares?).

Overall: This is an excellent camera, and results have been great. Im convinced its excellent value. Before purchasing, though, think twice about the use you are really going to make of it, and consider buying the Lumix FX35 instead. I know the TZ5 was a bit of an over-kill for me, and now Im stuck with larger handbags than expected.</Content>

<Content>I saw some pictures taken with the Sony DSC bridge camera and I thought the pictures, while good, werent as crisp as Id like so I decided to look at the Lumix cameras. Both Lumix cameras, the TZ5 and FZ18 (bridge model) Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ18K 8.1MP Digital Camera with 18x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) are great.  I wanted a camera with more zoom than the 3x or 4x on most point  shoot cameras. I owned a Leica point  shoot when film was still the way to go and always loved the great pictures I got from that camera so the Leica lens was a great draw. You may have to use a tripod or monopod to steady your camera at full zoom to get a nice shot--if you dont care for this consider sticking with more MPs with less zoom and crop--you should be able to crop quite a bit and still get a decent shot. I dont recommend using full optical and digital zoom with any camera as the pictures get more grainy, but if you have to get that tight shot you have that option.

Pros for TZ5: Ready to go out of the box in iA (intelligent autofocus) mode--goes automatically from landscape to macro and mega OIS stabilization is very good. Has 10x zoom and can go to full zoom using optical  digital zoom (I believe this gives you 28x). Has an E.Zoom button that will take you to full optical and/or extended zoom using optical and digital zoom without having to use the zoom lever. Amazed at how well the macro mode worked and loved the options to switch to wider panorama type shots.  There are 2 other scene modes you can program  save with your preferences so you can quickly  easily shift to your pre-adjusted modes using the camera dial. Large LCD screen. Menus were relatively easy to learn and can easily switch to different camera options. Pictures were crisp and clean. You can also be creative using BW, sepia, and vivid and other camera options. Burst mode and bracketing options available. Small size you can fit in your purse or pocket. If you prefer to have some options but dont want to fuss a lot with a camera this is a great point  shoot camera.

Cons for TZ5: The FZ18 shot better with lower light and overall the shots had noise, but still not bad for a point  shoot and not a big issue unless you do a lot of low light shooting. You can also try high sensitivity and sport scene options to as well as focusing options to get better indoor or low light shots. Details in dark colored models were not as easily seen on LCD--I couldnt see the details clearly on some skinny red orchids and just pressed the shutter on faith--I still got some nice detailed shots. Also, autofocus didnt do as well on dark colored objects and in dim light. Pale yellow didnt photograph as well in iA--at least not close up--I had to step back to get better color rendition on a pale yellow hibiscus. LCD has clear, shiny window over it that helps brighten and sharpen the image, but gets fingerprinty and may scratch--I use a microfiber eyeglass cloth to keep it clean.

I uploaded photos, mostly of flowers and plants I photographed in my yard so you can judge--the photos are un-retouched and not cropped. The day was bright  hazy, a breeze blowing so the flowers were not always sitting still. All were taken handheld. There is one handheld, indoors in dim light of my laptop screen.

I have not used the video function so cant comment on it. I also havent used all the scene options so I cant say if all work well. Backlight function worked pretty well.

I notice the silver TZ5 camera is cheaper than the black for some reason--if you dont mind silver and want to save a few bucks, that may be the way to go.  I will leave some comments on the FZ18 for those that want some info on that camera.

Verdict: A KEEPER. Much better than the previous Canon Power Shot I owned, which was slow and clunky.

Thanks to everyone for posting their pictures and comments on Amazon, I appreciate the assistance and I hope I have been of some help to other consumers in return.</Content>

I have big hands and the camera fits me well. I have never accidentally pushed a button. The camera also fits easily in a pocket. The battery that comes with the camera is long lasting and only takes two hours to charge even from total discharge. The best features of the camera to me are the zoom capability and the macro capability. Both deliver sharp pictures. The macro is so good you can capture the inside of a flower and with no worries about stability and blur. Id recommend this camera to my friends. </Content>

<Content>First off, this thing is a lot smaller then I thought it would be. I can easily hold it in one hand and take a picture. The video feature is awesome.I have a camcorder but I never use it cause I hate carrying it around. Now I take video all the time and easily transfer it on the the computer. The 10x zoom is very nice. I no longer have to get right up close to someone to take a picture. The lcd screen is large and vivid. 

The auto setting is pretty good but I prefer to use the quick menu to setup the picture the way I want. There are also a lot of preset settings you can chose from. The dial on the top lets you preselect two presets so you can get to them quickly. 

Overall picture quality is great in good light. Im still messing with the camera to get low light the way I want it. Face recognition works like a charm. 

My only complaint is the sound on the video is not the best. If your outside and its windy forget about it. Other then that it is a good camera and worth the price. </Content>

<Content>Key new features of the TZ5 that really work. 1) Zoom during movies: If used sparingly, zooming can produce very nice results. 2) Improved viewing screen: The improved resolution makes it much easier to use this camera. 3) IA (Intelligent Auto): This was missing from the TZ3. IA combined with the new engine (V4) makes the camera work quite well for most picture taking situations. 4) The mode switch on the back, which switches between taking pictures to viewing pictures, is an excellent addition of a frequently used function to a dedicated button. It is duplicated on the little wheel, but you will always use the new switch. 5) The quick menu button - very handy for changing the most common settings. 6) The TZ5 has an improve menu structure on the amazingly clear screen. 7) I almost forgot, the TZ5 takes better sharper pictures than the TZ3, especially in low light situations without the flash.  By far, this is the best super zoom small pocket-size camera to buy. After writing the above review, I took this camera to China, where I took pictures under a wide variety of conditions. The 10x zoom was essential for the scenes, some of which were in the distance and others were fine detail 50 or 100 feet away. I took dim-light pictures of the Terra Cotta soldiers in a huge room where flash was useless. The results were sharp and well exposed even at 10x zoom.  Is this camera as good as an expensive single lens reflex camera? It was good, but not as good.  Then again, you cannot buy a 10x zoom SLR, and an SLR will not drop into your pocket while you are walking around. At least not my pockets.</Content>

<Content>First off, the good: Shoots great, very detailed pictures, excellent videos, I love the high speed burst mode to shoot short series of pictures, the 10x OPTICAL zoom is awesome! The display is large and crisp. Is ready to shoot as soon as you hit the On button.

The Big Problem: 
The lens cover is very flimsy. The camera fell onto the ground from about 1 high and it took me 30 minutes of shaking and manually pushing the parts of the lens cover back and forth until it finally recovered and worked again.
On a recent trip to the Southwest (which was admittedly brutal with rocks and sand) the lens cover finally failed for good. Repairs are $160 flat, unless it was impact damage, sand damage, etc., which is the case here. Essentially I can get a new camera for the cost of the repair.
 
I have decided to keep my trusted, super robust Canon Powershot S50 for situations where I feel a more rugged camera would be good and not sure what to do about the Panasonic, yet.

Other issues:
The packaged software Panorama Maker 4 is unsuitable for newer Intel Macs and Panasonic and the maker of the software both deny any support responsibility. The USB connectivity reports the camera as NO NAME which looks pretty cheap. Triggering a shot through the USB cable is not possible. I am comparing this to my Canon Powershot S50 which is much more mature in this regard. Basic functionality is available through Mac OS X, and the Canon PhotoStitch software works fine with the Panasonic images.</Content>

<Content>Lumix is perfect for me, former pro photog in the 60s.  Recently restarted with an FZ20, liked it semi-pro.  Went FZ30, better.  Went FZ50 and it does excellent portraits/landscapes, so replaced my Olympus point-and-shoot (PS) (good camera, but xD) with TZ3K (black), and cut my shaky pix in half, improved my low light (harbors at night, etc.) pix, and got very good family pix even with the wimpy flash.  So when the TZ5A (blue) came out, it was just a bit pricey.  With Amazon discount, bought it early this year, and I remain very impressed with its quality despite being a PS.  The face recognition does a better job than the excellent TZ3, the 10X zoom gets shots I used to have to skip, color is very good, and it works well with CS3 and Elements 6.0 at 9 Megapixels.  This camera lacks manual controls, but from what Ive seen so far, I havent needed them: the automatic/ intelligent exposure rarely misses.  Battery life is very good (200 to 250 pix average before replace/recharge).  Ive become a Lumix fan because much as I loved 35 mm and 2-1/4 Mamiya and Nikon years ago, Lumix gives routinely nearly the same quality without the extra cost and complex menus that can buffalo us oldsters.  Lightweight, commonly available battery same as the TZ3, and it ran the 8 Gb and 16 Gb flash cards with no significant problem (counter has a display-only limit with 16 Gb).  With SDHC cards, the Lumix TZ5 (A, K, or S) is my choice for a non-pro but near pro-quality PS camera.  Wow!  Cheyguy</Content>

<Content>The one great thing about this cameras video is that you can have it when  you need it without carrying multiple items.  It will not replace a good camcorder, but it does provide good quality video (720 HD) with ease.  It is very small, and provides you not only with good video, but great photos.  I have used panasonic before, and have been very pleased with the photos and also pleased with the video on most of the small digital cameras offered by them.  

The colors in the photography is crisp and bright, and is very easy to use.  The video is good, but seems to have trouble with the autofocus during zooming, however, it is a big plus to be able to zoom in a camera like this. I have read that if you play with the settings, you can make the focus better during video.  Another big plus is the 10x digital zoom.  If you are looking for a good point and shoot camera with a good video option, you should be very happy with this.  </Content>

<Content>I found the still images to be excellent, as good as any other small camera. I shot about 90 images over two days and all but 3 were mis-exposed or out of focus. Color, sharness and exposure were consistently good under a wide range of lighting conditions. One setting identifies the kind of scene being shot and adjusts appropriately. It worked well, focusing on faces in portrait shots and identifying backlit conditions. 

But, Im sorry to report, the video performance was very disappointing. I found the videos to go in and out of focus when shooting a subject under bright cloudy skies, even while the subject was at a fixed distance, and I did no zooming. 

I reread the user manual and it said to turn off the continuous focus setting when taking movies. Could that be correct? Apparently it is, based on other reports of owners that talked with Panasonic tech support. But what happens when someone moves closer or further away? Isnt that what movies are all about? Moving subjects with action and some activity? 

So I did some checking reading dozens of on-line comments and reviews, and while most reviewers mentioned the issue, none classified it as a deal breaker. The most interesting discussion was on the Panasonic Forum on DPReview where many reported they contacted Panasonic, only to be told What problem?, This is the first Ive heard. 

Clearly if the camera has to revert to a fixed focus mode to take movies, this is a huge defect. While much about the camera is very good, this is a deal breaker for me. I did try making a number of videos in the fixed-focus fixed and they were slightly better, but, unfortunately  a lot worse than my Canon Elph 900 thats several years old. As a result I have returned the Panasonic camera to Amazon and will wait for this either to be corrected or the next model that hopefully will not have this defect. 

I would only recommend this camera to those that dont want to take movies. For stills its hard to beat, but for movies its unacceptable by any reasonable standard.</Content>

<Content>This is a great little camera.  I was a little hesitant to purchase after reading some of the criticisms by the so called expert reviewers, but decided to purchase the camera in the end mostly because of the lens and its capabilities. It is an easy camera to work, and it takes excellent photos, both in automatic, and manual settings. I took a walk by the lake on a sunny day to practice shooting with the camera and used the various features-beautiful photos! I was also concerned with the quality of indoor photos, but the red eye worked quite well, and I am happy that the indoor shots are very good-not great, but much better than my previous canon Sureshot. Also, the zoom lens is great, make sure to take advantage of the image stabilization. All in all I love the camera so far, im not an expert, but this camera makes it easy to take very nice shots.</Content>

<Content>I did research for about two months before deciding to purchase this camera.  I was originally going to buy the TZ3 for $249.99 and the day I was going to buy it I read an article that Panasonic was going to come out with the TZ5.

I decided to wait a few weeks and read what I could regarding the quality of the new TZ5.  It took a few weeks but reviews started popping up online and I was able to see the features of the new camera verses the TZ3.  I decided to go ahead and spend the extra $50 dollars and purchase this camera.

I am very pleased with the features of this camera.  I was looking for a small compact camera that was easy to use for my wife, but a large zoom for me.  Most point and shoot digital cameras have 3x or 4x zoom, this camera has a monster 10x zoom, which is great for my needs.  The camera stays relatively small so my wife can carry it around and with the Ai settings it makes it a very easy camera to use, which meets her needs.  I am also impressed with the photo quality of this camera.  There was one hang up though and I expected this so I knew what I was getting into - right out of the box I had to begin reading the instruction manual and adjusting the cameras settings to get the best picture quality.

Pros.
+ Small compact point and shoot with large 10x zoom
+ HD video resolution (720p capture with component cable playback)
+ Zoom while capturing video (option was not available in TZ3)
+ Ai setting makes the camera easy for beginners, just turn it on and shoot.
+ Large 3.0 LCD display screen makes reviewing pictures easy (the TZ5 also has a higher resolution screen then the TZ3)
+ 9.1 megapixel
+ Able to take pictures in different aspect ratios  4:3, 3:2, and 16:9

Cons.
- Picture review button has changed from the TZ3 model.  Now instead of easily hitting down on the 4 way directional pad you have to push a switch down to go into review mode to see the last picture you just took.  I found this a little slower than the TZ3 and one more moving part that can break.  For reference see the back of the TZ5 and notice the toggle switch from capture to review in the upper right hand corner.
- If the camera is not set to Ai then taking a good picture straight out of the box might not be perfect.  You will want to spend a little time reading the manual and adjusting some settings to get a great photo.
- Will only us SDHC memory cards.  Since I did not have a memory card this was not a problem for me, but if you are upgrading from an older camera you cannot use the old standard memory card.  The new SDHC cards are faster and it is suggested that you get a high speed card (transfer rate) in order to capture HD video.
- ISO Images above 800 do have artifacts (static) in the image.  This does not make the photo horrible or bad looking just noticeable if you blow up the image to a large size such as an 8x10.  I knew this going in and most digital cameras have this problem, some worse. 


After owning this camera for over a month I am very pleased with it and couldnt be happier.  I hope this review helps and if you still need information or possibly some sample photos, then go to Google and type in review Panasonic TZ5.  You will see a few great websites that can help you decide what the best camera is for your needs.

<Content>After Nikons and Leicas, its hard to like point-and-shoots, but I got this one for the HD video capabilities in a very portable format. So far Im pleased with the 720p results for videos of my baby. The focus is a bit on the slow side so you get some blurry passages as it tries to refocus on the move, but you can zoom while recording so its got the basics covered. The color is pretty bright and the resolution is worth the price of admission. Another downside is the seeming cap of 8min 37 seconds for each continuous video clip even though I have an 8GB card in there - not a biggie since long clips get pretty boring but you cant shoot a basketball game with this camera.

A hidden surprise was the intelligent autoexposure (iA) mode. It actually works really well. Ive futzed with Canons PS cameras in the past to get fill flash and other ways to get a decent shot - but iA mode does all that for you and the shots come out very well with no tiny menu surfing - big win. For indoor flash photography, it actually produces a few keepers here and there. 

All told its not a revolutionary camera and certainly not the super-slim ultraportable camera that youd keep on your person at all times....but HD video in your pocket! And some decent pics too.</Content>

<Content>I have used this camera for about a week now and there is NOTHING I could really complain about.  The pictures come out super sharp with really accurate colors.  The stabilizer is really reliable, and the zoom is fast.  The screen is OUTSTANDING....havent seen anything clearer.  I do like the quick zoom function, just press it and it maxes out the zoom for you.  The lens is really useful, and the fact that its still small enough to fit in my jeans pocket makes it a real winner.

There are tons of scenic modes that are cool but I havent gone through many of them.  The face detection works like a champ, and the intelligent auto mode is the most smartest feature that could ever be put in a camera.  I hate when I have a stranger take a picture for me (like when I want to get in the picture with a group of people at a restaurant and I have our waitress take the shot) and the pic doesnt come out great.  I have to always change settings or scenic modes to get a good shot.  Here the camera does it for you.  The intelligent auto mode makes the camera a real POINT AND SHOOT for those who dont know how to use it.

As others have mentioned the workmanship is solid, the camera feels really solid in your hand.  The camera is Made in Japan so you cant go wrong.  (I know some manufacturers start making stuff in Japan and later in the products life they make it elsewhere, probably to still make a profit after price drops, so dont hold me to it if yours isnt made in Japan.)  

The issues that some bring up about noise in the photos I think are overly particular and picky.  If you arent one of those kind, you gotta get this camera.  Go to various review sites to see sample photos, thats how I made up my mind.

<Content>   I must say that I am very satisfied with my purchase of the TZ5. I looked at the new Casio Z200 as well as the Nikon D500/600. Went to BH in New York City to see first hand. The Casio  Nikon left me unimpressed. Once I had the Panasonic in my hand, I instantly felt something different. Without experimenting with it, the outside  overall look of it had true sense of craftmanship. It really isnt that big for a Point  shoort  it has a nice, solid feel to it. The more I played with it, the more impressed I became. I absolutely love the fact that you can take multiple shots by simply holding down the shoot button. Great if you have a young baby or small children. Its not exactly an SLR but for a digital point  shoot, I think it works great. The pictures come out great  the 3inch screen is crystal clear. Im not a professional photographer,  Im sure some professionals may find some fault, but overall, Im really impressed with this camera. Nice job Panasonic !!! </Content>

<Content>The Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K is an extremely handy and effective camera. It takes excellent pictures, once you get your settings right, and has great wide-angle and telephoto range. Image stabilization is pretty reliable. Battery seems to run down more quickly than advertized because it drains even while connected to computer for downloading. And new owners are likely to spend quite some time with the manual digesting all the instructions for use. These cavillings apart, the TZ5 is small enough to take anywhere and is pretty well up to any photographic challenge.</Content>

<Content>I already wrote a review on the little sister, the TZ4, which is a phenomenal camera; I am however returning it because the price differential with the TZ5 is so low at this point it made more sense for me to spring for the few extra bucks on the TZ5 .

If you read any professional reviews, you already know that this is not the camera for poster size enlargements, even at low ISO values. While the noise reduction has been turned down, there is still some NR smudging  and  noise. Thankfully, the noise at least can be removed to the point where I was able to doctor a sample ISO 1600 picture to look just fine in 4 x 6 size (thanks to NeatImage). And Ive had no problems with 8 x 10s at ISO 100 and 200. 

And guess what? That is THE ONLY issue with this camera, and it is one that all other compact cameras also share to various extents. The difference here is that many other compacts also add lots of other negatives to the mix, such as severe wide angle distortion, wild and wooly purple fringing, reduced zoom range, and corner blurriness . The TZ 4 and 5 do nothing of the kind. 

For what youre getting, a compact, POCKETABLE 28 - 280 Leica lens with IS, there simply is nothing like it out there. And thats before even looking at the HD movie mode, the surprisingly accurate intelligent scene selection feature, the brilliant LCD and the jewel-like workmanship. 

This is the ultimate vacation camera if you plan to leave your DSLR home and travel lightly, and arent spending all day in museums shooting w/o flash. I highly recommend this camera, especially if you lock in the highest possible ISO value at 400, turn the dial to iA, and then give the camera to a complete newbie to shoot pictures with. I think he/she AND you will be very pleasantly surprised with the excellent results. </Content>

<Content>I also wanted to replace an older canon powershot AND an old canon camcorder.  With kids, it needed to fit into my SMALL messenger bag (about 7x9)along with diapers/wipes, etc.  I was leery of the quality of the video, as I had read reviews where they noticed the camera constantly trying to focus on the images.  If you turn off the autofocus and set the focus setting to the whole screen, you can alleviate this problem.  The video is GREAT, the photos are awesome.  I love that the battery recharges INSIDE the charger - wireless.  I bought a 16gb card with reader for around $80 on amazon so I can handle about 1 hr of the highest quality video (in 9 minute increments).  Its met all of my requirements.  It feels sturdily built, the lcd screen is amazing (get a boxwave screen protector!), and Im having lots of fun and finally taking the photos and videos of my kids I should have been taking for the last couple of years.  Always read reviews here on amazon but never written one - will update if any problems.</Content>

<Content>I love this camera.  I really do.  Im so happy with its performance and feature-set, Im willing to forgive the lack of manual controls and the price drop I just saw.

I pre-ordered and also bought a 16Gb SDHC card.  I plan on having this device replace my current Canon Powershot A75 and my Sony TRV-608 camcorder.  I can plan this way because... this camera shoots 720p high-definition video.  My big-screen LCD will really allow the captured video to shine.  In my preliminary tests on a 22 LCD, the output is gorgeous, so much clearer and vibrant than the Hi-8 video I would shoot using the old Sony.

Its a wonderful progression of technology.  My Sony camcorder can shoot in zero light, zooms to some ridiculous level, but I hardly ever use it because its yet-another-device you need to carry.  My Canon worked well for three years, then decided to stop running.  I loved the manual controls and ability to bracket shots, but with 3x optical zoom, I was missing something.  Plus, it was a family camera, and The Wife could not care less about manual controls.

The Lumix TZ5 is a perfect blend of features and performance for me.  It will allow me to grab high-definition camcorder video in the same device I can just hand to The Wife and say, Press the button.  It has a removable Li-On battery with separate charger, so I can buy a spare and keep them charged and ready to travel.  It does a lot, for a fair price.

I will miss the manual controls, especially for low-light shots, but in my testing Ive already seen how well it can handle low-light with no flash.  Pictures look remarkable, shutter lag is less than the A75, and flash recharge is not too bad.  The LCD screen is huge compared to the A75, almost the size of a PDA screen.  Thatll take some getting used to, especially since theres no optical viewfinder.  In all, Im really happy with it, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new point-and-shoot who needs the ability to grab quality video every now and then.  With two kids, thatll be every day for me.

<Content>I have a Pansonic DMC-FZ7 that takes excellent photos, but is a bit bulky when you dont want to look like a tourist.   Ive grown jealous of a friends Panasonic DMC-TZ3 which he keeps on his belt loop in a Lowepro Rezo 30 case.  It also has a wide angle lens which I dont have on the FZ7.  Ive purchased the TZ5 as a second camera for when I want to be a more discreet tourist without a camera bag.  This may become my primary camera.  

I am not a fan of small cameras as a rule.  Some of them (e.g., Canon Elph) have screens and icons so small, I cant see them.  But this camera has a lot of  features, most also available on the TZ3  new TZ4.  (The TZ3/TZ4/TZ5 fit into the Lowepro Rezo 30 case, but no room to spare.) 

The choice of which model to buy depends on your need for Megapixels and what you are willing to spend.  I have used my friends TZ3 and dont really notice any significant improvements in the workings of the TZ5 that would justify the price for routine point-and-shoot photos.  However, the TZ5 has a 3 inch LCD while the TZ3  TZ4 only have 2.5 inch.   That was a deciding factor for me.

If you need a camera where you look through a traditional view finder to frame your photos, this is not the right camera for you.  I prefer using the LCD screen, so I dont miss this feature. 

I find the Panasonic menus easy to use to access all of the varied features.  If you just want to use it as a point-and-shoot, its easy to do.  If you want to experiment, the features are there for you to play with... 

There is another feature on Panasonic that is an absolute MUST for me.  It is possible to set the flash off so it doesnt go off when you dont want it to (i.e., in places that restrict flash photography).   Some of my friends have cameras where they have to turn the flash off each time.   And they forget...

Another reason I opted for the Pansonic FZ/TZ series is the easy to use battery charger/rechargeable battery.  The batteries that hold their charge for 1-3 days, but I do carry a spare.  Im not a fan of carrying around AA or AAA batteries.

<Content>I bought this camera after 3 years of researching digital cameras.  I know its a little excessive but I wanted to make sure I was getting the best for my money.  A few things really caught my eye with this camera.  The 10x zoom.  The 460,000 pixel screen and the Intelligent Auto mode.  There are so many features on the camera its hard to explain them all.  It takes amazing pictures, especially for a point and shoot.  There are lots of scene specific choices.  It takes great night shots with the starry night mode and fantastic video in widescreen and highdef 720p.  Which is amazing.  I cant believe a camera this small can take this kind of video.  Im always trying to get pictures of my 8 month old nephew but he moves so fast I needed a very fast camera and this is it.  I always get the shot I want.  It has a rubberized grip and a spot for the thumb which helps alot because I just had wrist surgery and it helps me alot when holding the camera.  Most point and shoots dont have this.  It has convenient popup menu and camera or playmode switch which is really nice.  I would highly recommend this camera any day to anybody.  It beats out all the other point and shoots Ive ever used by a long shot. </Content>

<Content>As an advanced photographer with two pro DSLRs and an array of lenses I was looking for a light compact camera that will still have some of the features I am so used to from my DSLRs. This camera has the best lens in the industry bar none. Leica is superior to any other compact point and shoot lens out there (except other Lumix cameras that all use a Leica Lens). The camera is fast wt start up and can take 3 FPS in sports mode. It packs a 10X optical zoom and on the TZ5 can go up o 17X with some resolution loss. I never use Digital zoom as I do not consider it a zoom.
The Camera ergonomics is great, may of the features photographers need are easily accessible and well though of. I have been using the TZ3 for 2 years and took more than 10000 pictures with amazing results. I take many night shots and this is really where this camera excels. It can take 15, 30 and 60 seconds exposures which no other compact can do.
Battery life es very acceptable. A second battery is a recommended inexpensive accessory. The camera build quality is good, durable materials and high quality. I have evaluated a huge number of cameras and the Lumix comes on top by far based on its image quality, image stabilization, optical zoom, Leica superior lens, form factor and overall value. The closest camera you can get with similar performance is the Canon SX 100 IS. It is bigger, bulkier, heavier, much much slower and costs about the same. When it comes to compact point and shoot with advanced features and a hefty zoom nothing beats the Lumix.

<Content>I had been waiting for this camera to come out for a while, now that I have played with it for a few hours, I must say I am disappointed.  I dont think that there are enough tech upgrades to get this model over the TZ3.  The so called HD video is not HD by any means, and there are serious audio sync issues with the video I have taken.  The videos are VERY grainy indoors, but better outdoors.  The biggest issue is the very SLOW focus mechanism when shooting video, its terrible.  The main reason I waited for this camera was to have the option at better quality video, with the functionality of a PS camera.  Its quite large for a PS, and frankly, there are other cameras out there with as good, if not better PQ in a smaller package.  As far as the camera functionality, not much different that the TZ3.  I dont think the extra pixels are worth the price.  All I can say that its going back to Amazon.  BTW, Amazon, how about filling the air bags in the shipping box with actual air.  Mine came with 3 deflated air bags, and a camera box that was loose in the package.</Content>

<Content>I pre-ordered this from Amazon and it was shipped from JR Music World.  I have had it about a week and I am very impressed.  I returned my Canon SX100 because of poor battery life, this Lumix blows the Canon out of the water.  Charged it for only 20 minutes out of the box and got over 3 hours of play time.  I was concerned the first couple of indoors shots I took, kept coming out red, with a little time spent playing with the scenes and camera I think I have figured it out.  The ULTIMATE test for me is to go to a museum and take test shots.  The shots I got were some of the most crisp and vibrant I have ever taken!!  Zoom is INCREDIBLE and shots taken outside in bright conditions are wonderful!  I love the feel of it, it has a lot of bulk, not heavy but just feels very secure and SOLID in your hands! The TZ5 LCD has double the pixels of the TZ3 and is a simply the best LCD I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!</Content>

<Content>I purchased the TZ5 because I was interested in the 28-280mm zoom lens (35mm equivalent) for a trip to SE Asia..  A couple of friends had the TZ3, which peeked my interest.  However, I was ultimately dissapointed in its performance in low light situations and ISO over 200.  I had read that the TZ5 would prove superior in this regard, but it turns out only minimally so.

I have spent the last two days putting the TZ5 through its paces and comparing it shot by shot with my Canon SD870.  The Canon blew it away time after time, especially in low light situations.  I was looking for a camera that would give me the same quality image as the Canon SD870, but also provide a more substantial zoom range in a small package.  The TZ5 fell short.  However, I dont know of any other compact camera outside the Lumix TZ line that offers anywhere near the zoom range, so it does benefit from occupying a very unique niche.  

My advice:  If you need the 28-280mm zoom lens, its your only option.  If not, go with the Canon SD870   </Content>

<Content>I received my TZ5 today, and so far Im impressed. While some of the improvements over my TZ3 are minor, some are significant. Most people will enjoy the return of zooming ability while taking video, and the introduction of HD video. The TZ5s LCD screen is the nicest Ive ever seen on a camera. Ive taken several dozen test pictures under different circumstances, and the results were for the most part very good. Under perfect conditions, the results werent much different than the TZ3. Under low light conditions, the Venus IV engine seems to do a little better with noise at ISO 400 and above. I wouldnt call it a dramatic improvement though. Im going to do a little pixel peeping in the near future to see how the TZ5s small sensor handles the increase in megapixels. All in all, the TZ5 is just a great camera that is loaded with features. Is it a DSLR? No, but its not supposed to be. If you already own a TZ3, you may want to weigh whether the TZ5 has enough new features and improvements. For myself, Im happy with the upgrade, and will give my TZ3 to my wife. The only thing I wish that I had done was get a black TZ5 instead of the silver one.

<Content>I have the TZ3 and am acquiring the TZ5, so my comments apply only to the still picture process, which is straightforward. Dont be swayed by the favorable comments on the 28mm wide angle lens - when shooting landscapes or large groups of people etc., all you will see in the details (with real users images) is pixel smear. The whole point of a fat and heavy camera like this, which does not fit a shirt pocket, is the long end of the zoom, which could be 350mm, but sadly is only 280mm in actuality. For shooting people and landscapes, there are wide angle cameras from Casio, Sony, perhaps even Panasonic, that are small and light and pocketsize with up to 14 megapixels that have much better image quality than this camera. Where this camera really leapfrogs over the others I mentioned is in the long zoom. When shooting pictures of birds and other things small or farther away, this camera will give you *much* better images because of the long zoom.</Content>

<Content>[EDITED] 03/29/08: []-indicates modifications

Ive had the camera for [about 2 weeks now] so bear in mind that not all the features were tested.  Also, this is my first advanced point and shoot camera so I cannot compare it to others I didnt own.  Ive tested the reasons why I chose this particular camera.  The high resolution, compact size (cant really test that except that it fits in my pocket great!), and its ability to shoot high resolution video.

The high resolution is amazing but only a 4 star.  4 because there will be much playing around to do in order to get the sharpest possible image.  Perhaps the ISO was set too high, perhaps I didnt use the perfect setting, much playing around to be a perfectionist - and only because I am coming off a manual digital camera where you have full control.

The pre-set settings in this are incredible!  It even has a pre-set setting for PETS!  I shoved the camera in my spaztic cats face and as he was trying to get away, I had a clear and up close shot of his face (with FLASH!) Any other digital camera and it would have been fuzzy or non existant as the lag between shutter, flash, and actual photo would be greater than the cats ability to dissapear within a second.  I did this more than once - super sharp and ultra fast!  Poor cat...

There are baby-settings where you can give it a name and birthdate!  Probably so you can title your pictures automatically later - I dont know yet - but its cool!

Face detection - perfect!  4 faces in one shot I believe.  Also, the flash compensates to the distance to each face (multiple flashes) so if youre closer to one person, that persons face wont be washed out in light!  Thats amazing technology!

Enough tech - plenty more in there to play with - onto the video!
I wanted a camcorder replacement so I dont buy another gadget just to take the few videos I DO want to take.  Something fast and easy to capture the moments as they arrive out of nowhere.  This cameras ability to take 1280x720 wide-screen videos to display on our flat-screen is what I was looking for.  I only give it 4 stars though - which is STILL such a feat!  The reason for a missing star is the cameras inability to focus fast enough on moving objects or while youre zooming.  Im sure the motor tech will develop over subsequent cameras but for SUCH a small package to deliver such high resolution clips is truly a feat!  The maximum length of video at the highest resolution [tested] is 2GB [turned out to be 10:38 minutes].  Most videos wont need that much continuous shooting anyway so thats not a big deal.  The format is Quicktimes MOV.  Ill need to play around with transfering that to DVDs but looks great on the computer!  You can get the optional component cable that hooks directly onto the camera to the TV for instant enjoyment. (it comes with a VGA cable).  [I hooked up the camera to a 42 HD Plasma via the AV cable and got a great resolution - better than a broadcast TV and JUST shy of HD sharpness - but I was up next to the screen so sitting back at the couch - doubt I could tell the difference.  The AV cable is mono with one video out so the sound only came out of the center channel speaker.  Id give the sound 3-stars as there was a detectible background noise - I made sure to test it with little sound to decipher.  Sounds and voices came out clear - but it was not high fidelity by any means.  This is definately NOT a surround sound HD camcorder!  The camcorder clips however are phenomenal!]

Oh, also, to download pictures from the camera to the computer?  NOTHING REQUIRED TO INSTALL!!!!  You plug the camera in the USB port, turn on the camera, choose PC on the camera (you can set it to always be that), and the computer recognizes it as a hard-drive from where you can drag and drop to your hearts content!

This is NO DSLR where you have full control - but thats not what this is for.  So as you can tell, I highly recommend it and know it will be the perfect companion for pretty much all your photo-video needs in ONE tiny package (which travels VERY well!).

[I am still working on posting samples - Im sure others will beat me to the punch now that its widely available and on sale]</Content>

<Content>This canon camara for this price takes excellent shots and very easy to use. I just took the camara on vacation on a cruise to the caribbean and it was a pleasure to use. The pictures are very vivid and the many knobs on top of the camara are easy to use to change from auto to landscape to portrait etc. Im really enjoying this great little camara by canon.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera for my huband who wanted a pocket camera. We have a Canon Digital Rebel XT for general photos but it does not have video capabilities and is not  pocket friendly. He found the Canon Powershot to be just what he was looking for and because we have a small Camnon photo printer, we can hook it right up without a problem.
He/we are still playing with it , but all in all it was a great camera for the money.</Content>

<Content>This camera is a wonderful value, but it has one flaw that might make you think you got a lemon: the LCD makes almost every picture look slightly blurry.  Compared to other Canon Powershots, the image preview looks washed out and ugly.  However, the actual pictures come out looking great, and the image stabilization really works.

Video quality is extremely good, and as far as I can tell theres no limit on how long your videos can last.  The sound is good in most situations, but loud noises (such as concerts) blow out the audio.

My only other complaint is that it can take a long time to actually take a picture after you hit the shutter button.  Prefocusing helps, but sometimes the camera will simply refuse to take a picture.  Playing with the modes might make a difference; Im not sure.</Content>

My husband likes the Canon brand so I chose this for him and so far we have loved it!  He wanted something small to fit in his shirt pocket (check), something that took good photos and had automatic on it (check), and easy wide/telephoto button (check).  We have been happy with our pix from this camera.  I can recommend it.  I noticed that my siste-in-law and daughter both had Nikon Cool Pics, and I would like to compare our photos from a family wedding the other night.  I think the Canon would stand up to the Nikon!</Content>

<Content>Unfortunately not many point-and-shoot cameras have optical viewfinders anymore and thats a shame.  This camera DOES have an optical viewfinder and that helps it to stand above the crowd.  It also has an LED screen but such screens are nearly impossible to see in bright sunlight.  Holding a camera at arms length to compose a picture on a screen can introduce shake and cause blurry photos.  Therefore, for many, using an optical viewfinder is a much better option.

Having an optical viewfinder, image stabilization, face recognition and a 10 megapixel sensor enables an amateur photographer who is using this camera to take superior photographs in good light that can and will yield sharp 8 1/2 X 11 prints.  Although I usually use a digital SLR, I must say that Im impressed with the quality of the images that this camera delivers...especially considering its low price, small size and 7-ounce weight.  With rechargeable or lithium AA cells, battery life is excellent and recycle times are short.

The July 2009 issue of Consumer Reports features a cover photo of this camera and ranks it just below a $450 camera in its compact camera ratings.  On their recommendation and after doing considerable comparison shopping and reading other reviews, I bought this camera for my stepson.  However, before I gave it to him, I took many photos under varied conditions to ensure that it would be adequate for his needs.  I was so impressed that Ill probably get one for myself.

The fact that I could favorably compare the photos from this camera with those from my much more expensive digital SLR was remarkable, but there are inevitable limitations.  There are no manual settings for exposure or focus.  The 4X optical zoom may not give as much range as some photographers need and the effective flash distance is limited.  The sensor has excellent dynamic range, but introduces noise in the pictures when theyre taken in low light with ISO settings above 100.

A couple of AA batteries are included with the camera, but youll soon need more and better ones.  A small 32MB SD card is included but a much bigger SD card or cards will be needed if you want to store more than seven or eight full-resolution photos.  Therefore, your initial investment will need to be larger than the base price of the camera for it to perform up to expectations.  Nonetheless, when considering the price, small size and very good image quality I believe this camera will meet or exceed the expectations of all but the most demanding amateur photographers.</Content>

<Summary>Best Value for a Point-And-Shoot Camera</Summary>
</Review>
<Review>
<DocID>B001EQ4C80-10</DocID>
<Content>Im not a super-savvy photographer, just somebody who wants to take a decent picture.  This camera does all the work for me and makes me look like I know what Im doing.

Most of the time I keep it set on Auto, so the camera figures out whether a flash is necessary, what the ISO setting needs to be, all that stuff, and makes it happen.  I set up the shot and press the button, and the photo comes out great.  

I have tried some of the other specialty settings, like Floral, for taking close-ups of flowers, and that does help to bring out the colors without over-exposing them with the flash.  Ive also tried Nighttime and Aquarium settings, and those both were very helpful.  Ones I want to try but havent only because I havent been in the right environment yet are Fireworks and Beach. The point is, its very user-friendly for someone who doesnt know a whole lot about what theyre doing.

A friend told me he thought I didnt need 10 megapixels, but I quietly disagreed with him.  I do a lot of stuff in print publishing, so I know that the resolution of photos matters.  I got 10 megapixels because I figured I wouldnt have to worry about resolution or size issues, and I was not wrong.  Every photo Ive taken would work just fine in a print format.

Downloading the photos is pretty easy.  Sometimes my PC forgets where the program is, even when I have the camera plugged into it, so I have to find the program instead of having it launch automatically.  Once Ive got the program running, though, it pretty much manages itself.  Then it brings up a viewer that allows me to see and edit the photos one at a time, or play them in a slide show.

Here are the few, minor downsides Ive discovered so far.  Those specialty settings are a little buried in the menus, so the first couple of tries I couldnt remember how to get to them.  Same thing with some of the more advanced, do-it-yourself features.  I wanted to take a photo of the full moon and I knew there was a way to adjust the ISO settings manually, but I couldnt figure that out without the manual in my hand.  Since I didnt happen to have the manual with me up at the top of the mountain, I was out of luck.

The biggest downside (and its not even that big) is this camera burns through batteries like theyre matchsticks.  Ill use the camera over a period of a few hours, turning the camera off when its not in use or letting it sleep or shut itself off when it wants to.  After three or four of those types of sessions, it tells me it needs new batteries.  If Ive used the flash a lot or if Ive taken movies, the batteries burn up much faster.  I havent tried using rechargeable AAs in there yet, but I think Im going to give that a go.

The battery compartment is kind of tricky to open.  You have to slide a button forward and then slide the cover off to the right.  Its hard to hold the button forward and push to the right at the same time, so I usually have to work at it a few times before I can get it open.

Youll also want to purchase a case to carry  protect this, and a memory card with lots of capacity.  I got an 8 MB memory card, which in this camera can hold 2500 photos at a time.  I havent even come close to filling it up yet.

Overall, the camera was definitely worth the price.  Ive made a point of noticing when Ive been at stores that sell this camera, and nobody else has had it available for a lower price.</Content>

<Content>This camera suits my needs very well.  Along with basic camera functions, I wanted something that worked with a macintosh.  The pictures can be automatically uploaded to the computer using iPhoto and OS X.  I have OS 10.3 and iPhoto 6.  The software that came with the camera wanted OS 10.4 and above.

As for the camera itself, I found that it did not like the rechargeable batteries that I had.  Thus, I had to order Canon rechargeable batteries.  They work well. To give it credit, the manual clearly says that the camera works with alkaline batteries and Canon rechargeable batteries. 

The SD memory card that came with the camera is too small for practical purposes.  Be prepared to buy a larger card.

I have had the camera less than a month, so I am still learning about it.  The default settings work well, but a little tweaking might make things better.

One thing that surprised me is the focusing method.  This camera defaults to face detect. The camera must have had fun finding a face in my flowers.:)

The ability to view the pictures on a TV is nice.</Content>

<Content>lightweight, easy to use and set up.  appears to take good quality pictures.  the only concern with the camera is that there seems to be a bit of a delay in between taking pictures, meaning if you want to take multiple shots fairly quickly, you may lost the moment waiting for the camera to return to shooting mode after taking a picture.  this may be due to user inexperience with this new camera, as I have not thoroughly read the manual/instructions.  Other than this, the camera seems to be exactly what I was looking for when making this purchase.</Content>

<Content>a href=http://www.amazon.com/review/R308EVBPTAXTVKWatch Video Here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R308EVBPTAXTVK/a I purchased this thing because my mother has a Cannon that is very similar and I loved the quality. I have had two digital cameras prior to this camera in my life. Each time I paid about $150-$200 for the camera. This one was only $130 about, and the quality blows away thet Kodak I had, and the Pentax (the last one I had). 

The most obvious difference between this one and others Ive had is the picture and video quality, especially the video quality. When I play back a video on my computer, it looks and sounds like a professional camera. It looks like you are watching a TV program the quality is so good. I couldnt believe it. I looked at the file sizes and I knew why. I think my videos are 10 times the amount of space as my other cameras were. I bought a 4GB card to replace my 256MB card. It is worth it though. I save all my videos and pictures on a Seagate external hard drive. Love that thing.

Main reasons for buying this camera were: Brand name I trust .....

This little baby just blows me away. It fits in a pocket. Its cute. It uses AA batteries, which is VERY helpful when youre constantly out and about and dont have time to charge a special camera battery. The pictures are very high quality for the cameras size - never before have I taken such accurate nighttime shots. I am legitimately obsessed with this little guy. No, this isnt one for the professionals, but for folks like me, who like to take lots of snapshots and only dabble in the more artistic side of photography, its absolutely fantastic. </Content>

<Content>I did a lot of research before buying this camera. I was looking for a camera in the $100-$150 range to replace a Nikon Coolpix I had had for 5 years; I was happy with that camera until I dropped and broke it. I bought the Powershot on the basis of a couple different camera comparison sites which rated it technically very highly, and because it is one of the few cameras in its class with a separate viewfinder, which is very useful when shooting in low light or very bright light when its hard to see the image on the screen. I like the way it feels in the hand and the choice of colors was fun, too - who ever heard of a brown camera! Ive been using it now for a few weeks and am very happy with it. It makes separate sounds when you focus, and then when you shoot; my Coolpix didnt make any sound so if you werent familiar with the camera you wouldnt know if the picture was taken. I bought a 4 gig card with it for an amazing $11, so it holds 1500 photos. Highly recommended.</Content>

<Content>The Canon Powershot A1000IS sounded ideal with its optical viewfinder (very rare in low-end digital cameras), small size, convenient handgrip, well-designed controls, 4x optical zoom, many up-to-date features (10 megapixels, auto face detection, etc.) -- and above all, with Canons great reputation. (Ive owned several Canons.) Im an experienced photobug and, after reviewing the controls, I took my new A1000IS to a childs bowling alley birthday party. What a disappointment! Due to extreme shutter lag that I havent seen since the earliest digitals, I missed shot after shot as the kids raced around me. The exposures and flash performance werent great either. I immediately returned the camera. It doesnt begin to compare with my wonderful (and rave-reviewed) Fuji FinePix F30, which has developed a shutter problem after several years of service. My only difficulty with the F30 was lack of an optical viewfinder, so that in bright sunlight I was literally shooting blind, just pointing in the direction of the subject. I thought I would solve that with the Canon Powershot A1000IS -- but no such luck! Id buy another FinePix F30 if they were still available; however, the newer Fujis havent received comparable reviews. Think Ill try a Nikon Coolpix S560, since my daughter raves about her S550 (a tiny bit wider angle, 34.8mm vs. 35mm equivalent, and more zoom, 5x vs. 4x). </Content>

<Content>I have read the manual which covers the cameras features adequately.  The camera has Easy Mode (point and shoot), Auto (auto-focus and exposure) mode, presets for different conditions, and manual mode in menus.  4x optical zoom x 4x digital - optical is usually enough.  2-1/2 LCD screen on back can be scratched by contact with hard objects.  Manual mode menus are two levels deep and require you to know the corresponding symbols.  I suspect this may slow some manual users down, especially at first.

I have had a good experience with Auto mode pictures - in general very sharp pictures especially using the zoom to get close shots.  This is my first camera.

<Content>I was looking for a smaller pocketbook sized camera to take with me on the go. I own a canon SLR that is awesome, but not easy to take with me all the time. I have not been disappointed! So far, photos are perfect and camera is very easy to use. I like how it feels in my hand as I am used to having a lot of camera to hold on to. I like the color options too, I got a blue one! And I saved $10.00 by buying it on Amazon.</Content>

<Content>This is a feature packed, good performing camera for what you get in the price-range.  I would say its biggest flaw is that it does not support charging the batteries while they are in the camera; and since you do have to regularly remove the batteries to replace or recharge them, the access to the compartment is awkward.

But, for the quality of the pictures and the ease of changing settings for special conditions, this camera makes up for the battery shortcoming, especially for the price.</Content>

<Content>I was looking for a camera that was small enough to fit in my pocket, but still took the great pictures I am used to from my bigger, fancier Canon camera.  AND I FOUND IT!  This is an awesome camera at an awesome price.  It has all the things I love about my expensive camera; different setting for different lighting conditions, rapid fire picture taking and the ability to manipulate the shots to what you want.  I looked and looked for something like this and am actually surprised that it is so cheap.  The only thing oyu arent getting is a really powerful zoom, but if you dont need it (ie - taking pictures of kids, family events, etc) then youve got yourself a deal here.  Highly recommended!</Content>

<Content>Everything seems great on this camera so far.  Only problem: memory card only holds about 10 photos.  I discovered this while taking photos of my newborn niece.  (Not a time when you want to discover this!)  I recommend buying another memory card with a greater capacity at the same time as you buy the camera.</Content>

<Content>This camera was for my wife who has had trouble in the past using digital cameras. We bought this camera because it has an optical viewfinder in addition to the LCD screen. We are most pleased that we did so, since the screen is almost impossible to see in bright sunlight. Dont buy a camera without an optical viewfinder! The camera has a special setting for novice users which eliminates most decision making, although it has many sophisticated settings if you want to use them.  I highly recommend the camera although there are two negatives. The batteries ran down quickly, although I suspect using Lithium batteries would solve this problem. The zoom works easily but switches from optical zoom at 4X to higher zoom levels which are only digitally enhanced. I wish the zoom would stop at just the 4X level unless you intentionally overroad it. Otherwise, a great camera.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera because my we wanted a camera to replace out outdated Canon 6mp.  My Wife opted for this over the Panasonic Limix, as it was compact and could fit easily in her purse. We ended up getting the Limix later...
I was disappointed with this camera from the beginning. Taking indoor shots in a large room, the flash is inadequate, about 5 Ft is max.  The flash/mode controls are not easily changed on the fly and are somewhat confusing.  Our older Canon was easier in this aspect.  Pictures were not as good as our Canon SD-1100is, which Id strongly recommend if you want a compact that takes better pictures than some of the big boys.
And consider this; If you are prone to misplacing or loosing small things, consider a larger camera.  My wife lost hers (it slipped right off of her wrist while walking from an event) after only 2 hours of use..</Content>

Its very easy to use...it has great results and great pictures. I cant believe the changes in quality and color with this camera.  Its definitely worth its price.  And downloading the pictures to my computer is a lot easier than using a dock.  Plus its the perfect size for taking with you, but not too small that you can lose it.  Great Camera!!</Content>

<Content>While this camera does more than just point and shoot, thats the main reason I got it.  Its pretty intuitive to use, and although the manual seems very well organized and clearly written, I could pretty much pick it up and use it without any difficulty.  A memory card comes with the camera, which is nice, but it has a low capacity, which is not good if you dont think about it before you use it and then run out of memory.  However, since this is for office use and there is rarely much need to take more than 20 pictures at a time, it was easy to adjust the size of the photos so the card will hold more.  And the pictures were still very good.  </Content>

Amazingly, the video function is nearly the equivalent of our sony mini-dv videocam.  The camera is lightweight, small enough to fit in a pocket but large enough to hold onto.  The viewscreen is very bright and clear, but there is also a viewfinder for when the light is too bright.  There is little or no shutter-lag, which is very important to me.  And the built-in flash does a very nice job out to about 15 feet or so.  The face-recognition feature works well, but seems to be most effective in closeups.  </Content>

This old camera has only 2 MPixels so the prints are limited to about 8 x 10, nevertheless I was surprised when I took several pictures at the same conditions and it show clearly that for some unknown reason the sensor CCD used by FinePix 2800 is a much, much better.

<Content>Great camera with a 10mp capability.  The price is definitely a plus.  We bought this to supplement our digital SLR.  Its often easier to shove this small camera into a pocket than grab the camera bag and the attachments for the SLR.  We recently used it for a trip to Kitty Hawk, NC, and the results were great (but not as good as the SLR.)  Recommend you also buy a 2 or 4 GB SD card as the 32MB card that comes with the camera will only allow about 8 pictures at high quality.</Content>

<Content>I mostly shoot with Canon SLRs, but we wanted a compact camera for the times when we dont want to lug a bulky camera around just to take snapshots.  I also wanted a simple camera for our kids to use.  We used to use a Canon S50 for that purpose, but its getting long in the tooth and I felt it was time to replace it.

My criteria were simple- it needed to use AA batteries and SD memory cards, because I didnt want to clutter our house with another charger or buy new cards.  We have tons of rechargeable AAs in the house, Id use those with this rather than disposables.  And it needed to be inexpensive, but still take good photos.  I also wanted optical image stabilization and an optical view finder for bright, sunny days.  I didnt really care about the brand, but Canon has always served me well.

This wasnt the least expensive camera out there, but it was the least expensive that gave me everything I was looking for.

For what it is, this little camera is fantastic.  It doesnt compare to SLRs in terms of performance or image quality, but I wouldnt expect it to.  It does, deliver nice snapshots.  If you know how to pre-focus (a necessary skill with all autofocus cameras), its quick enough.   The S50 that it replaced was a $500 camera when I bought it six years ago; I think this is faster and more fun to use.

The photo quality is good; I put the camera on easy mode and snapped a few shots of my kids.  The camera used fill flash appropriately, and did a good job with exposure.  There is almost no noise in the ISO 80 photos (youll get these in bright light if you let the camera select ISO).  ISO 400 has pretty bad noise; it looks like ISO 1600 on the Digital Rebel XT or XS, but it is entirely acceptable for snapshots that will be printed at 4x6.

I didnt buy this to be a video camera, but it has pretty much replaced a six-year-old Mini-DV camcorder.  The video quality is almost as good as that one, and the camera is more convenient, so weve found ourselves getting video that we otherwise would have missed by not having the video camera with us.  Dont expect stunning video, but it sure beats the VHS video of me when I was a kid.  Its good enough to record the memories.

The build of the camera seems a little flimsy, especially the battery door; Im docking the camera a star for that.  The battery door is also difficult to open.

The manual controls are pretty limited, but, to be honest, I dont feel like I need them on a camera like this.  You can manually control the ISO and flash; letting the camera pick the shutter speed and aperture based on that is fine for me.  If I want full control, I can lug my DSLR around; if I have this, I just want to record the moment.

For the price, this camera is great- it does everything I expected it to do and it does it well.  Look elsewhere (and be prepared to spend more money) if youre concerned about manual controls or advanced features.  But if you just want an inexpensive camera to capture memories, you cant go wrong with this one.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera when it first come out (for $199) to replace my older 4-year old Canon Powershot that used 4 AA batteries. The older model had a memory limit (for compact flash card) so I wanted trade up to something with more capacity to store videos and more high resolution photos. Since I was already familiar with the Canon buttons and menus, it was a short learning curve. This camera performed much better in low light compared to my fathers Casio (his indoor and night shots turned out very grainy).

Since this model only uses 2 AA batteries, I find I do have to change them more often but I just keep extra rechargeable ones in the camera pouch. I like the lighter weight, the many features, and the available colors (yes, its a Girl thing, I admit it!). 

A note about recovery speed for taking photos: I found that this has to do more with the brand of the memory card Im using. I missed a number of opportunities for some interesting shots on trip I may not be able to take again. I thought the batteries were running out of juice. However, swapping the batteries out with fresh ones didnt make a difference BUT changing out the SD card did! I was using three different brands -- dont get the cheapest ones unless the write speeds are decent.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for a vacation to California and was very pleased. My friends were very impressed with the quality of the images. As the days passed, I took better and better shots. I kept it on 
Auto most of the time and found that to be satisfactory. 

One minor gripe, you can turn the flash off, but not force it on, that would be handy when you are outside, but have shadow on your subjects faces. Other than that, and for the money, I am more than satisfied with this camera

Edit: Upon reading through the manual, I find that I am mistaken. You cant force the flash to fire in AUTO mode, but can in other modes.</Content>

<Content> I was looking for an inexpensive pocket sized camera, that took good pics, was of good quality and was easy to use. This camera is truly all I wanted and more! I just returned from vacation and in reviewing my photos, I noticed right away that it worked well in all lighting conditions. I mainly used the Auto function, and once had to use the night function, when I took some pictures inside a cave. The cave pics turned out much better than I was expecting. The lighting was good and the details are clear and crisp. But what I liked most about this camera was its portability- it stayed in my pocket almost the whole vacation. (I still havent found a case that will clip on my pocket.)Because it was at hand, I took more pictures than usual. I am very pleased with this camera and would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a quality product, that is easy to use and versitile.</Content>

<Content>A quick little review for this camera.  I bought this camera sort of on a whim while on vacation.  My previous camera, also a Cannon Powershot, had fallen to the ground and would not work.  Since the old camera was about 5 years old, I felt it was time for a replacement.  

The new camera is packed with features, half of which you will never need.  This model is a 10mp which is agreat step up from my 3mp that it replaced.  I have only had this for a month now, so I am still getting used to it and all the features.

One thing to note.  This being a 10mp camera for the price is what attracted me to it.  I wanted something a tad smaller than my original powershot, but this model kept me looking at it.  It smaller and lighter, yet still has the fell of a bigger camera.

Only gripe so far is that I have not yet figured out how to take instantaneous photos with it.  There is always 1-2 second delay.  I am sure I can get around that, just have to find the setting!</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera for my in-laws for Christmas.  They are completely non-technical, have never used a digital camera or computer, and my mother-in-law asked me twice where does the film go.  That being said - they can understand and use this camera.  It does not have a ton of features, which is good because it would only confuse them.  That is not a slam to them, its just fact.  At the same time we purchased one of the small HP portable printers for them.  My father-in-law understands it enough to use it when he wants a quick print, but I explained just taking the camera or card to get multiple prints or bring to me and Ill take care of it.  

Christmas day we printed out several pictures on the printer, and they came out great - I, as well as my husband and in-laws were thoroughly surprised at the level of detail (says a lot about the camera and the printer).

Shot to shot time is not particularly fast, so be patient, and dont move the camera too fast after taking the picture.  Im used to my higher end digital cameras though, and Canons are known for their slower response time.  

I had a hard time deciding between 3 and 4 stars.  On the one hand, I think I expected the drawbacks of this camera, so with that expectation and based on the low price, and the great picture quality, it should probably be 4 stars.  However given Canons overall reputation as a leader in digital cameras, I think I expect better and a little faster and had to settle on just 3.  </Content>

<Content>Been looking to get myself a new camera after my previous one broke.  After reading various reviews, I went for this one.

After a week of taking pictures of about anything I can think of, I love it.  Takes good pictures, lots of user friendly features and adjustments for when I took to take some more difficult shots.

Only problem I have is the terrible battery life.  The ones packaged in only lasted 2-4 hours tops.  I replaced them with some new batteries.  Same life-span.

Look into getting a supply of re-chargable batteries on hand if you looking to be going somewhere you plan to use your camera alot.</Content>

I decided to spent a lil bit more for a high quality camera. the only problem I have with this product is the orange light on the front of the camera facing the subject. It comes on when you take a picture. So with the baby she stares at it and stops smiling whenever I try to take a pic. She already stares when she sees the camera but she does even more bc of the light.The pic quality is great. but that darn orange light...</Content>

<Content>I love this camera.  It takes very sharp pictures and it is easy to use.  It is compact enough to take with me wherever I go.  It takes excellent pictures in poor lighting conditions.  I also like the convenience of using AA batteries as long as I use the rechargeble long-lasting kind then I dont have to worry about short battery-life issues and having to carry bulky/heavy nickel cadmium type batterris that require a special charger.  When I travel abroad I rather just carry a couple of extra AA batteries in my pocket or in my backpack instead of bulkier batteries with a corresponding charger.  If I lose my batteries theyre easier and cheaper to replace than the other kinds.  I do recommend a simple carrying case to keep it protected because it does look a little bit fragile.  Better to be safe and invest in a carrying case.   </Content>

The camera is only 3 months old and we have not taken 100 pictures yet and I am on my 3rd set of batteries.  As soon as I know just how many shots I am getting on aset of batteries, I will be contacting Amazon and/or Canon to try to find out what the problem is.

Im glad to see that this Canon still has a view finder: so helpful for bright sunlight or times when you want to hold the camera extra steady. Its small enough to take anywhere but still has a slight bulge to help with grip. It works well on the full auto feature but also lets you use more detailed settings. It is easy to adjust exposure for strong backlighting. Weve been using a SanDisk Ultra II SD Plus 2GB Card for easy camera to computer transfers. </Content>

<Content>I got the Canon A1000IS camera for Christmas 2008...along with the case from Canon...to be sure it was protected.  I took a few photos around Christmas and in January, mostly to learn how to work the camera.  Then in early March I left for a 3 week vacation to South Africa.  After shooting, perhaps, 400 photos at 10mp the lens error occurred and the carmera became unusable.  None of the (non-violent) solutions proposed on the WEB helped so here I am on top of Table Mountain without a working camera.  Lets just say Im not totally happy with this purchase.  </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera based on wonderful reviews.  And in good lighting, I have taken some good pictures.  Unfortunately, I have not had the same experience when I have had to use the flash.  The recovery time of the camera would range from 10-15 seconds before I could take another picture.  That may not sound like a long time, but when you are taking a group shot and want to get another one, it is FOREVER! And trying to get multiple shots of a 3 year old in that situation is impossible.  Ive tried different batteries, normal and rechargeable, but there was no significant change.  I was very disappointed and will be returning the product.</Content>

<Content>The Powershot A1000IS has given me great pix! It is very easy to use; even has a setting for easiest use!
It also has the flexibility to do many types of serious shots, with the added feature of image stability. The range of picture quality is helpful, as are special settings for night, sunset, aquarium (which works well when shooting through car windows),beach, and snow, in addition to the auto setting. I like the kids/pets setting which captures moving objects. I started getting great shots immediately, and after having a chance to read the entire manual, I am getting even better shots! Comes with a photo program, or you can edit a bit and print directly from the camera.</Content>

I just found out last night I could record a movie and size it for Emails.....works great the zoom is locked but thats ok.  On the batteries,  if you are using rechargeable use Duracell 2650 mAh.  you can find it a Walgreens charger and batteries for about 20 bucks.  up grade the mem card to atleast 4G and I have read that you cant erase all the pics at once, yes you can, use the card format feature and it will erase the card slick.</Content>

<Content>Bought this camera because I was looking to own a cam that is AA battery operated. My old camera was a 2003 graduation gift (canon powershot sd100) and it still works fine, I just fed up with keep buying new batteries (for $40) every year not to mention how much I hated to lose pictures due to battery issues. Now I can just replace the old batteries with new AAs and Im good. 

There are two things I dont like about this camera, the A1000IS. 1. the flash. The flash is at the very top corner of the camera and most of the times I dont even realize that I cover it when I shoot the picture....and the picture will come out dark. Also, the flash on my old and now 6 year old Canon Powershot SD100was brighter and better than this one.  2. the materials used for this new camera are pretty cheap compared to my old SD100 which was hard metal not some cheap plastic like this. The pictures it takes are nice but Im not sure if its any nicer then the ones I take with the SD100.</Content>

<Content>  I bought this Canon Powershot just before leaving on a family trip and had just a few hours to familiarize myself with it before putting it to work. Given my lack of familiarity with any digital cameras, I have little with which to make a comparison, however, I found the camera easy to use and was very satisfied with the resulting pictures.  
 I was warned by my sister that the capacity of the memory card supplied with the camera would be too small, so I immediately bought another card. If I hadnt been forewarned, I certainly would have been disappointed on my trip. 
  Finally, in the course of two weeks I took about 300 photographs and ran through three sets of batteries. The 2x batteries are inexpensive and easy to find, but I dont know if that rate of use is par for the course.
  Overall, I was pleased with the ease of use and the quality of the pictures.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for my wife and we have both enjoyed using it.  It takes great pictures outdoors, and the face recognition is amazing! My wife likes that when she reviews the portrait photographs that she has taken, she can  turn the camera vertical and they turn vertical to take up the whole screen like they do in the photo taking mode.  The one down side, for me, is that the flash on the camera is not that strong.  You have to be up close to get a good shot in lower light conditions, but if you get too close you burn the people in the photograph.  All in all it is a great camera, and this is coming from a professional photographer that still shoots film for my projects.

<Content>The camera is surprisingly good, though of course a $130 camera with 10 megapixels wont be as sharp and clear as a $600 camera with 6 megapixels, so dont be fooled by pixel count. The memory card that comes with it is a joke, so pick up a $10 8-GB card wen you order the camera. Two drawbacks: cant shoot in raw mode, which limits your retouching options, and requires special software/drivers to read from the card - no pretending its an external USB drive. Oh, and its hard to delete a group of photos even WITH the software - you have to go one at a time through the cameras interface, or delete all. When you go over 800 ISO (what we used to call ASA), the image quality is badly degraded; 400 is probably the sweet spot.

All that said, the feature range is stunning, the photo quality is sometimes amazing, and its a pretty darned good camera.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera to replace my 6MP Nikon Coolpix L1 compact. The screen on that camera had become damaged, though it still took good pictures. I gave that camera away to a friend in a 3rd world country.

I researched this new camera online quite a bit before purchasing it.

The main thing that attracted me to this camera was that it had an optical viewfinder. That feature was lacking on the Nikon L1, and I will never again make the mistake of purchasing a camera without an optical viewfinder, since its very hard to take pictures outdoors without one.

Another very important feature to me was AA battery support. Also nice was SDHC card support (so I could share the same card as in my DSLR). And of course the camera has a good number of megapixels.

Once I got the camera in my hands unfortunately, I was disappointed. The optical viewfinder is very small. And its optics are very bad - you dont actually get a clear view of what you are shooting through it.

The colors that you see at shooting time on the LCD screen are severely lacking and in no way match the final result of the pictures.

But the worst part about this camera without question is the image quality. Every single shot I took was grainy. Even at ISO 80 the noise is pronounced. Also, the pictures are not sharp. Even though they seem to be in focus, small text is unreadable even when magnifying the picture 1:1 on screen. This was completely unexpected. The image quality is worse than my first digital camera, a 3MP Olympus C3000 from 2001. And it is noticeably worse than the Nikon L1. I played with all the settings on the camera to try to make it better but to no avail - I was very frustrated.

Unfortunately, this is a fatal flaw, and none of the nice features of the camera like IS, or the excellent software, can make up for it.</Content>

<Content>This camera may be 10MP, but my 5MP Nikon Coolpix 5000 and 5400 took sharper pictures.  The body of this camera seems like flimsy plastic.  Every flash picture Ive taken has suffered from redeye.  Worst of all, there are two very bright hot pixel groups which have appeared within two weeks of the cameras purchase.  These are very prominent in the viewfinder, and are quite annoying.  They show up in the final images too, but are less obvious.  The only way to get rid of these is to send the camera to Canon, to have the hot pixels remapped.  There is no way for the end user to do this himself with this camera.  Also there is no RAW mode unless you run the CHDK hacker toolkit, which hasnt yet been ported to this camera.  It seems to me that 10 megapixels exceeds the capability of the lens to deliver a sharp image.  But since there is no RAW or TIFF mode support, theres no way to know for sure.  It could just be JPEG compression noise on every freaking image, which I find disappointing.

On the positive side, the cameras face detection is excellent; the flesh tones are very real; the camera is very compact in size, and uses standard AA batteries. The preview LCD is large, and there is also an optical viewfinder with tracking zoom.  The automatic lens cover works great.  Im sure there are worse cameras in this price range, but I really expected more from Canon.   

Bottom line: if you want something cheap, get a used Nikon coolpix.  If you really want a Canon, save your money and get a Powershot G10 for $350.  That is a superior camera.  </Content>

<Content>The 10.0 megapixel A1000IS is a good camera but nothing that I would consider a massive improvement in everyday 4x6  to 5x7 photo quality over my old Canon Power Shot 2.0 megapixel A40.  The video function is improved but thats video -- and it eats memory like a hungry hound. In most pedestrian ways I prefer the A40.

I know both cameras and their functions.  I find myself having to manipulate and resize nearly every photo on the A1000 once I download it on the computer - and thats on the lowest quality setting.  The red eye is much more prevalent on the A1000 than the A40 and low light is a problem with or without the flash.  The A40 was always reliable.

The A40 has 4 shooting modes plus video. The A1000 has eight plus video.  In this situation, less is more. The A1000 is a nice camera but its a simple case of how much do you really need?  

Like so many things today, we have too many choices.

<Content>I have already posted some photos on Flickr and have received some pretty positive reviews. 

Why I like the camera for travel because:
1. It uses AA batteries, I use rechargables.
2. The camera has a view finder which is very helpful when you are outside with the sun behind you.
3. Technology is very advanced. Does a great job finding faces and managing focus. 
4. Tripod mount.  
5. And I think the best price on the market for the technology and megs (10mps).
6. Its easy moving the photos to the computer.</Content>

<Content>After a lot of research and hands-on examinations, I have now purchased the Canon PowerShot A1000IS and am very happy with it. It is a great point and shoot camera that is fun for my family to use right out of the box with the EASY button setting. It has some more technical settings if one wants to tinker a little with their shots, but I bought it for my wife to carry in her small purse and take fast, high quality pictures without any fuss and this camera fits the bill. I have found Canon products and tech support to be superior over any other maker of consumer electronic products, especially including cameras and printers. The flash recharges faster with rechargeable Ni-MH batteries and they last longer. I bought a AA/AAA charger with 4 pre-charged AA batteries for only $10 and they work great, last forever. Also like the use of SD memory cards that are fairly cheap, readily available and work directly with my printer or through the included mini USB cable that I connect to my computer. I have owned a Canon 35mm SLR camera in the past and was always very happy with it, but cannot say the same about my prior Pentax, Nikon, Kodak or Sony camera purchases, both digital and non-digital. The Canon A1000IS is just a good all-around camera for general everyday use. It is small and compact, yet loaded with features and looks and feels like a more expensive camera. I really like the inverting LCD display, wide angle option and location of the zoom feature on the top shutter button insead on the back of the camera like most digitals. I will be buying a Canon again for sure. </Content>

<Content>I just bought this camera today, right out of the box I was able to take great photos. Thankfully, I had a 2gig card from my older camera, so I did not have to buy a new one as the one they give you holds next to nothing in photos. Still great to have a card though so not picking on it. I have been wanting a small compact camera that takes great photos. I think I found exactly like I wanted. I got mine at Target for 30 dollars more then what Amazon sells for. Still, not a bad deal. I paid less then my first camera, and still paid less then my last fugi camera that died in the first year.</Content>

<Content>Camera was purchased for my wife who reluctently agreed to enter the digital age.  Wanted a point and shoot camera that was compact and fairly simple to use but she still wanted occasional creative control.  She takes many photos in bright sunlight so a optical viewfinder(not too many point and shoot digitals have them) was a must since many LCD screens are difficult to see in bright light.  So far the camera has met or exceeded her expectations.  She took a whole series of photos outdoors in bright sunlight and photos taken at the Thanksgiving Dinner table and sent to the local Walgreens for processing were very good. Took a short video with a 4GB HC card just for fun and it actually looks pretty good on playback! All in all so far the camera is performing very well.</Content>

<Content>  Thumbwheel w/icons on top are easier for my big fingers, instead of thumbnailing small buttons to scroll the LCD menu. Note the optiical stabilization (preferred over digital) and the 4x over usual 3x. I like the idea of AA batteries, being in the woods or on a roadtrip, you can pop in two spares, or buy them most anywhere. What if you left your charger at home? ...And where is the nearest outlet? Consumer Reports, 12/8, top-rated ENERGIZER Ultimate batteries, and the Sanyo LSD eneloop battery  charger kit (at amazon, about $34.00) look interesting. OR,..you could just carry a spare compact-type battery used in most other rechargeable  point-and-shoots. </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera about 15 days back. I have used it a couple of times indoors, outdoors and indoors with low-light conditions.
Used correctly, this camera does a great job of taking good quality images. I had to play with the camera for about 15-20 mins to get familiar with it so I could take the best pictures possible. My sister owned a Powershot A530 before this one and i had the same experience with that too.
This camera fits nicely in your jeans pocket and is quite light. 
You will need a tripod to take good low-light shots. I have a cat and a rabbit and a 3 yr old nephew - The kids and pets setting really works well to take pictures of them. Generally the few manual settings it does have are good enough for a serious amateur photographer.
One gripe I do have is that with regular AA alkaline batteries the flash recycle time can go up to 8 seconds and the camera is blank and unusable during this time. This of course is a problem with most canon Powershots. The solution I have found is to use batteries made specifically for taking pictures (Duracell makes some) or just use rechargeable NiMH batteries. This works great. Almost down to 1 sec between shots with that.
Overall Id definitely recommend this camera to anyone. But you have to be a little patient and get used to it first - I think this is true for any good camera out there though.</Content>

<Content>I got this camera a few weeks ago to replace a previous Canon digital camera (the A540) that I absolutely loved. So far Ive been very happy with this one, with one glaring exception - not specifically about the camera itself, but rather the software that comes with it.

Im an amateur photographer and find that this type of point-and-shoot works well for me - especially since it has a 4x optical zoom which gives clearer, more vivid photos.  I really like how easy the Canon cameras are to use and the range of features - and this one doesnt disappoint. I also like the 2.5 LCD and the fact that this camera is small enough to easily fit in a pocket or purse. Its really very versatile and I love that about it.

The only things that I really can complain about are that I do somewhat miss the chunky handgrip on my previous Canon, but thats not a huge deal. What IS a huge deal, for me anyway, is their updated version of the Camera Window software that comes with this camera. This is the software that you run to download photos from the camera - and I cant believe how horrible this particular version is. The previous version that I used with my other Canon camera was great - it was windows-based and you could select any photos on your card then download, print or delete them as you wished. However, in this new version - its got a black interface, no text by the icons to tell you what they do - and there is no way to delete the photos from your card. I e-mailed Canon to double-check and was told that yes, this is the case - you have to use Windows Explorer to delete your photos. Why I would want to use two different programs when before I could easily use just one is beyond me... Im going to re-install the old version that I have and hope that it will work with this camera, because I am incredibly annoyed with the new version right now.

Other than the software issue, I love this camera and think that its a very good choice for someone who wants a camera that takes a great quality photo and is easy to use and carry around. I only hope that Canon will re-think the Camera Window decision - Im a loyal Canon enthusiast, but am very disappointed in them right now. </Content>

<Content>This is the first point in shoot camera I have bought in over 5 years so when I decided it was time to upgrade my old digital camera I was surprised to discover that I could get a 10MP digital camera for half the price of what I paid for my old 4MP digital camera. 

This camera is simple to use but delivers great photos. The main reasons I picked this camera is because of size and price and its performance which I have read about here and various camera websites. This camera is small enough for me to take with me anywhere I wish to go and its not a cumbersome burden like my old camera, since I have taken up hiking and rock climbing in the last year this is extremely important to me and so far it has been great to take along! The pictures it takes are awesome! I was really impressed with the quality of photos this thing takes when it is utilizing the digital zoom, it can really get out there and deliver quality of photos leaps and bounds over the digital zoom capabilities of my old camera!

Overall its a compact camera that is simple to use and delivers amazing photos! Doesnt take a pro to use this camera and get profesional results.</Content>

<Content>This camera takes excellent pictures. I particularly like the Optical Image Stabalization, Motion sensor, and face recognition. I only make 4 X 6 prints. So far no problems. The pet/children mode does a good job of stopping action. 
Ive used the optical viewfinder a couple of times. It doesnt show 100% of the picture, but it sure makes a difference in extreme sunlight. 
Sometimes it is necessary indoors to increase the ISO in order to increase the flash distance (easily done with a button). I still get great pictures. I know some reviewers blow the pictures up and indicate the noise in the picture. Its just not evident in normal picture prints. Im sure there would be obvious noise if I was using high ISOs. Battery life is great also. I use Lithium AAs. They last so long there is no need to use recharageable batteries. 
The only thing I definately miss is a button to delete ALL pictures. Theres a button for individual deleting, but you have to use the menu to detete all. I guess you could look at it as a safety feature, making it hard to accidentially delete all your pictures. 
There is a lack of manaul controls, but I never used the manual controls in my prior cameras. 
The camera size will fit into a pocket, even though I prefer using a case that fits on my belt. I would highly recommend this camera to others. </Content>

<Content>This is an excellent camera for the price, but I was a little disappointed about one thing and pleasantly surprised about another thing.

I was disappointed that I couldnt manually focus as I could do with the Canon a510 that I purchased 3 1/2 years ago. This is especially helpful in low light situations. Its also nice to be able to check whether or not the auto-focus has focused properly...You can set the A1000 to macro, normal and infinity, but from there you have to hope that the auto-focus worked properly.

I was pleasantly surprised that the aperture automatically adjusted to the changing light conditions in the movie mode. You can also lighten or darken the light reading in the movie mode, but if you do this, the aperture wont adjust to changing light conditions as you make a video.

The camera is small enough to fit in a small case or pocket or pocketbook.

<Content>This product is perfect for a starter. The big screen and easy to use options make it a nice gift for an elderly person, who has never used a digital camera. At 7.1 MP, this camera takes nice and good quality pictures. However, if you compare it to one of the higher end products, this does not compare very well. In summary, if you are using it just as a basic quick camera, this works. It is portable, stylish, and easy to use.

yes, the lack of a viewfinder makes for awkward shooting, if you hurry.

otherwise, it has few modes to choose from, making it idiot-proof for a pointshooter.  having videoshooting capabilities is nice.

so, now we wait to see its longevity...</Content>

<Content>I cannot for the life of me take a good picture with any Canon camera.  I owned the A570IS 7.1 MP for awhile, sold it and went back to a Fuji for my good camera. But I also wanted a small sturdy camera I could just toss in my hobo bag and go, so I ordered the Canon A470 to give a Canon another try, since so many others love them.  I got the red one, but when it arrived, it looked more like bright hot pink or a magenta, than a true red.  So for those of you guys who are wanting the red, I would choose another color.

I received the camera fast, did the set up, started taking some pictures.  No matter what setting I chose, other than the close-up macro setting, the pictures were somewhat grainy.  Close-up pics of items like jewelry were really great, so if you are looking for a good camera for taking Ebay pictures, this would be a good camera for that.

The A470 is really large for a newer model of camera (although this has been out a couple years now, most cameras of this era are smaller).  However, it seems to be well built and I would especially think it would be wonderful for a tween boy or girl on up through the teens.

I was pretty impressed with the movie-making mode; pretty good sound quality and my movies were not grainy at all.

HOWEVER, if you are thinking about this camera, Canon does have a newer model which replaced this one.  Check out the A480 and it may fit your needs also.</Content>

<Content>We bought this camera for my 10 year old son for his birthday.  He wanted a real camera that he could use.  This camera takes great pictures and video.  It is easy to use and isnt too complicated like other cameras with several scene shots available.  The only issue I have is my son tends to walk around taking video and when he does it drains the battery quickly.  I know more my problem than the camera.  When the batteries arent fully charged and you turn the camera on the digital display is blank.  I thought it was a problem with the camera but having had this happen several times and replacing the battery I figured it out.  He did drop the camera on our wood floors from about 3 1/2 feet and the camera is fine.  Being 10 he isnt the most gentle either and the camera seems to be holding up just fine.</Content>

<Content>I am very happy with this product. I recently took my family to the San Diego Zoo and this camera took great pictures, captured the colores and details very nicely. I had a little trouble figuring out the different features, only because theres so many to choose from, but other than that this camera was easy to use and easy to upload pics from memory card to my laptop. Two thumbs up :)</Content>

<Content>I purchased a Canon A470 for my granddaughter on her fourth birthday.  I was uncertain whether or not a child of this age could use a digital camera, but she had no trouble at all (except for chopping off heads for the first hour).  Very young children can really only point and shoot, and will need help with zoom and other features, but this camera is wonderful for small hands.  Its many features will make it useful as the child grows and skills develop.  We now have many puppy pictures, but we also have macros of violets growing in the woods as her view of the world expands.  I highly recommend starting children with this camera.</Content>

<Content>Purchased this camera for moms birthday. After she took the 2nd picture the lens would not retract back into the camera body. She called customer service, they said send it in and pay the postage costs too. This was a new camera, customer service said they couldnt know how much the camera had been used already, and were unfriendly. 
The camera was sent back to amazon as defective.</Content>

<Content>Purchased this camera as a gift for my niece.  Very nice camera, she likes it especially for taking shots of growing children!  Personally, I would miss not having a conventional viewfinder, but she was used to having a camera with only a viewscreen, so it is fine for her.  Screen has decent brightness, even outdoors in sunlight.  I have a Canon S1IS which I love, and I am sold on Canons quality and features.  Overall, the A470 is a very good little camera!</Content>

<Content>After researching affordable, good digital cameras for months on end, I finally decided to buy this camera. So far, I have not been disappointed with my choice. The pictures come out crystal clear which is primarily what I was concerned about in a digital camera. Youre able to record videos on it as well, and there are a decent amount of features that come with it. The camera comes with software, a memory card that can hold about 10 photos (buying another memory card along with the camera is a good idea), and batteries. If your looking for a digital camera thats not too techie and sophisticated and can take excellent pictures all for under a $100 then go for this baby. You wont regret it.    </Content>

<Content>About 6 months after buying this camera from Walmart, I can not use it. It still looks like new, and when it held a charge it worked great. However, rechargables, expensive digital camera batteries, and regular batteries only last 15 seconds when installed into this camera. At first I thought it was that the rechargables that I use had met their fate 5 years after buying them. So I went and bought brand new digital batteries - they lasted 15 seconds. I put both types into different electronics, and they are still working months after the A470 said the batteries were dead. I am buying another one, and will not use another Canon product. This was my first Canon device owned, but I never purchase something from any company that fails to perform.</Content>

<Content>I was looking for a camera for my moms birthday that was extremely simple to operate, but still took good pictures.  Shes very non-technical and doesnt even own a computer.  This camera turned out to completely fit the bill.  There are very few features, which makes the learning curve pretty short.  Macro capabilities are pretty nice and unexpected, which my mom loves so shell be able to take pictures of her flowers this spring.

For someone who needs a basic camera that just works, this is it.  If you need anything more than the basics, youll need to look elsewhere.</Content>

<Content>This is not the camera to get if you need alot of features, but if you are like me and prefer a simple point-and-shoot camera that takes nice pictures and is solidly built, this is the one.  I hate how dainty and fragile high-tech things like cameras have become, but the a470 seems durable enough.  I like the size which is not too small and kinda fat because its harder to drop or sit on or whatever else I tend to do with smaller devices.  It has taken great pictures so far, so I am certainly pleased. </Content>

<Content>The quality of the pictures is just amazing. Canon definitely has the better optics (especially compared to Panasonic and Sony). That and it uses AA cells. I like the design, it actually feels stable in my hand, thus I dont shake with it like the Panasonic. It may sound like a drawback compared to Li-ion units, trust me its not. When you are outside the country in a place where electricity is not as stable as in the States, having the ability to buy AA cells at any corner store is a plus. </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera based on the excellent(for the most part) reviews and price. So when i got home and opened it, it did not have the camera advanced operations/users guide manual in the box, it only had the basic/set up manual. So rather than wait for canon to mail me a users guide, I decided to print one at home and waste expensive printer ink. The manual recomends that you take some practice/test photos to find out which features you like and of course to see if the camera works like it should. So I put in a new set of batteries and I ended up taking about 10 pictures and the annoying low battery warning light came on. Ok, I thought just a bad pack of batteries. So I decided to try another unopened set of regular(alkaline) batteries, so after 15 photos this time, the low battery light came on again! I said: thats it, Im returning this camera. I did not feel the need to try for strike 3, and I was not about to go out and spend atleast $15 for a rechargeable battery pack because the reason i bought this camera in the first place, was to save money. I have read many different camera reviews and some people complain about batteries dying at 60-70 pictures, try 15! The camera itself takes good pictures, has many good features, and is easy to use, so i wontt give it bad reveiw for anything else except the battery life...</Content>

<Content>Nice camera.  Novice here, but I like the size, style, and easy user interface.  I have just been taking pics and video using auto mode, but look forward to playing with the settings in the future.  Pics and video come out very clear and vibrant.  Camera does what its supposed to do.  Like the under $80 price very much.  First camera I received had a hot pixel, so all images had a small white fleck midway down the right side.  Return process was very easy, and I am now awaiting what I hope to be a problem free replacement from Amazon.  No motion blur.  I took a pic of my ceiling fan when it was on and the pic made it look as if it were stationary at the time the pic was taken.  Will upload the pic if anyone wants to see.  Good camera, IMO.</Content>

Bad camera, i dont recomend it.

I cant RMA it because i live on Venezuela and i use a courier to buy it, if i want send it back to amazon is going to cost me the same price that i pay for the product.

<Content>Hi I have 23 years old and I bought this camera because im outside my country for 6 months and I wanted to take some pictures for my records. Looking a good quality/price relation it is the best that I found, and by the moment Im really happy with the camera, excellent pictures, may be a little difficult to understand all its functionalities but it include a pdf instructor for that, just that I havent have enough time too see it on detail. But for casual pictures, its great, very easy to use, windows compatible, good videos, so I definitively recommend it.

The only bad thing is that could be a little complex to know all its functinalities, but I suppose that is the same with all cameras.

I have read that its a little fragile, but i havent any problem yet so I cant say that. If you are carefully, you shouldt, may be if you are looking a camera for kids, could have problems with that, but f its for you, should be ok.</Content>

<Content>This is my first digital camera. I bought it for $90, after a lot of research, and I must say its well worth the price. I use it primarily to take pictures of items for my online store, and it provides very sharp, bright pictures for that purpose. I find that most pictures do need some color adjustment, which can be done with the software provided. The camera is very easy to use, and the software was easy to install. I love the macro feature for doing close up shots, and power zoom feature is great! The LCD screen is very bright and a good size.

The only complaint I have is that the color of the camera reflects off the shiny surface of the items that I photograph, which is my fault, because I just had to have the orange model! If youre taking pictures of shiny pieces of jewelry, glass, etc., buy the silver camera.

All in all, Im incredibly pleased with the Canon Powershot A470. It definitely lives up to the Canon name.</Content>

<Content>This is a great camera. Has a 2.5 screen and its quite bright. It has a zillion settings you can make, and  all the bells and whistles the average user could ever expect from a less than $100. camera. I paid $91.  free shipping. Ya cant beat Amazon for the great service and safe shopping .

For the photo nut who wants special effects, itll take some doing: the F stop and the shutterspeed are automatic. It suits nme fine because I want to take pics, not spend all day fiddling with the cameras options. It does take great pics, no question!  Im quite pleased with it!!! 

 If I had to make a less than positive comment, its that the 186 page manual is in PDF format; that means iit is in the Canon disk, not a printed manual!  Its a bugger to print if youre not good at printing such PDF documents using both sides of the paper.  On the computer screen, the manual is quite big and bright. Also if your sharp with computers, you can download the manual to your memory card and read the manual from the camera screen, while youre away from home and your PC!. All in all, its not a camera for the very very photographically involved; but, rather, if you take lots and lots of pics of home, family, vacations, etc,  youll love the A470 Canon Powershot</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera as a Christmas gift for my 13 year old daughter.  It is a great first camera with good features and takes fantastic pictures.  For under $100 I havent seen anything else that has such a high resolution and has a great name like Canon attached to it.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for a good all purpose camera.</Content>

<Content>Im not a fancy photographer, I just want to point and click. This baby is easy to use and powerful enough for everyday shots. It replaces a PowerShot 2MP so the detail in my images is a real step up for me. Also, I usually dont care about a gadgets aesthetics vs its utility, but I love that its cute and shiny. :D Looks great IRL.

<Content>We purchased this camera and it seemed like a great buy.  The pictures were gorgeous on the viewing screen.  Then we got them printed... every single picture was blurry.  So we adjusted settings per instructions.  Still blurry.  Well, it was a Christmas present, so it was purchased and sat under the Christmas tree (wrapped) for a couple of weeks.  Then we took in on vacation the first week of Jan. When we got home we put the pictures on the computer and they looked blurry.  Then we had them printed from an online digital photo store.  They printed blurry.  Of course, by this time, the electronics warranty had expired and we are now stuck with a useless camera that takes useless pictures.  Buyer beware.  I would not recommend this camera to anyone, ever.  Im glad I did not write a review before we had pictures printed up.  </Content>

<Content>it works

brill for wifey so she leaves my canon sx10 IS  alone

she points and shoots and the green button idiot mode works great (sorry luvvy)

much better than on my canon g3 (which was the bees knees) where i had to use manual settings

stick a 2 gig sd card in and it takes a thousand shots - she is still on the first charge of the nimh batteries... so you need a decent size card and rechargeables nimh - oh and a decent charger which goes into 10% trickle mode too otherwise you cook em

<Content>We decided to purchase this camera for our 7.5 year old son for Christmas.  We felt he was too old for the kiddy type cameras yet he wanted a digital camera to use.  This was the perfect option.  

He doesnt use it really often (were still getting over the holiday busy-ness) but hes quick to grab it when he sees a nice photo opportunity - like tonight he got a shot of the dogs snuggling.

The camera is just his size.  Its very easy to use.  Hes used other, pricier, point and shoot cameras so felt very comfortable grabbing this one up, turning it on and taking a picture.  It is easy to learn.

Takes AA batteries - would have preferred rechargeable, but its not a big deal for him.  If he starts using the camera so much we are having an issue with batteries, well just use rechargeable AAs.

We purchased a little case for it for under $10... makes it easy to clip to a belt loop and protect the camera both.</Content>

I also ended using it a lot because it is so light weight and compact (can fit in a pocket). We are very happy with this camera and with good rechargeable batteries it has a nice battery life. A 1 G card works well, you should buy one with the camera. I would recommend this camera.</Content>

<Content>We got this camera for our 8 year-old and she loves it. Easy enough for her to use, but not cheap like kid cameras usually are. The software and photo quality are top notch. 

Yes, it goes through batteries quickly, I HIGHLY recommend the powerful eneloop rechargables for this camera. Also, get a 2GB or 4GB card when purchasing this camera or just lower the mega-pixels to 3 or 5.

Pros: 
Price!
Large screen
Good movie mode
Nice software
Easy to Use
Great photos
Common batteries
SD Card

Cons:
Uses batteries quickly
No Image Stabilization

<Content>I love this camera--I got it for Christmas, and for a teen who really just wants to take pics to put up on facebook and all that, its absolutely perfect, I would definitely recommend this if you are buying it for a teen. THe only short coming is that the memory card it comes with holds about 25 pictures. I tried to make a Christmas album with it the night I got it and I had to keep uploading the pics onto my computer to make more room on the memory card. I will definitely buy a card  that has more space. Other than that, it is a great camera.</Content>

<Content>My camera just stopped working -- on Christmas Eve nonetheless!  I have had it exactly 4 months.  I have not used it very often -- I liked it while I was using it.  The only drawback was not being able to see what I was taking a picture of if I was outside in bright sunlight.  Up until today, I would have given this a great review.  However, I was just taking a picture when it froze and will not turn back on again.  I will be sending it in for repair, but I would think that a camera should last longer than 4 months!

UPDATE:  My camera was repaired after it quit working.  Now, 4 months later again, it has DIED AGAIN -- this time in the middle of my sons piano recital.  Im fed up!  Do NOT buy this camera.  I have contacted Canon customer service and they will be sending out a prepaid shipping label to pick it up.  However, Im forced to buy another camera that will actually work when I need it to!</Content>

Awesome pictures and I love the large picture preview window. Nicely compact without being too compact and so cute!! My only negative thing to say and I cant say it would have kept me from buying the camera but the instructions on how to use all of the little extras are very vague if mentioned at all. I know it can do more than I know how and hopefully will learn soon how to do those things by playing around with it. All and all though, great camera for the price. </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for my parents in India after a lot of research. Main usage of this camera for them would be at home. I initially looked for kodak easy share which also had great reviews for beginners. But then a CANON is a CANON. Though it is not that sleek and light weight, it has most of the features my own canon SD 750 has. I put a 2GB card in it and its all set.

The only thing i am disappointed at is that we cannot use canon re-chargeable batteries in this. But a AA battery recharger would definitely solve the issue.

I ordered it from Amazon on thanksgiving and it arrived on the estimated delivery date. I am very pleased with Amazons delivery schedules.

Overall, I am satisfied with this camera and would recommend it for anyone looking for a branded camera, with good features, at a reasonable price.

Human-friendly camera, easy to use, GREAT pics and just what else could you ask for? Oh yeah....was at a GREAT price. Got an HP camera a couple years ago, cost much more and wasnt anywhere as user-friendly as this one. Plus, it kept eating batteries so couldnt keep it working.

<Content>This is an excellent camera.  Really a great value for your $.  We bought 3 for the office to use for field survey.  Our office is an electrical, mechanical and plumbing engineering firm.  We have used more expensive Sonys before and people drops them all the time.  

Pros:
- Excellent image quality. It has Canons Digic III image processor.  
- Uses 2 regular double AA batteries.  Big advantage for us, because different people use the camera everyday.  Just pop in AAs and you are ready to go.
- Zoom is 3.4X.  You get a little bit more than the usual 3X zooms.
- Fast startup.  When you turn on the camera, you can almost shoot right away.  
- Large 2.5 LCD screen
- Manual control for ISO (80 to 1600), exposure and white balance
- 7 megapixel
- Shoots 640x480 video with audio
- 2 sec and 10 sec timer


Cons: 
- NO viewfinder
- No wireless</Content>

<Content>My family and I have gone through so many digital cameras, I cant count them.  Previous to digital, I had an old Canon Elph film camera that I loved (and previous to that, an old Canon AF35 from the 80s, which I adored-even though I had several SLRs)), but digital was the way to go for me, as Im the type of person who will shoot 50-100 shots to get a good one.  This camera does it for me except for one feature:  when I am viewing pix on the camera, the zoom stays right in the center, I cant wander all over the image as I have been able to do in other Canon cameras, Sony Cybershots, and Olympus cameras.  Thats it, my only complaint.  The nicest thing about this camera for me is that I can take shot after shot with minimal waiting.  Two weeks ago, we went to shoot the Fall Foliage (that always sounds so pretentious!)up by Flagstaff and my partner said I cant believe how fast that camera shoots-Ive never seen one recover so fast!.  Got some really nice shots,even while driving, so the motion thingy works pretty well!  I have a 2GB SD card, its been enough, but I always have a spare in case Im not able to get to my computer and upload the pix to Costco in a timely fashion.  Oh and the battery issue?  I have no complaints,when last used, I went through 250+ pictures before they registered as low (Kirkland Alkaline).  Part of why I chose this camera is that I can always get/carry batteries if I cant get to a charger, especially overseas.  I WILL NOT buy a camera with rechargables!</Content>

<Content>This camera is a great buy.  It has tons of features and takes quality pictures.  Specifically, my wife and I really like the microphone and speaker that are built into the camera - picks up sound well for videos and also makes it very easy to review AND HEAR videos on the camera.  The menus are intuitive too and easy to navigate.  Overall, this camera is an excellent purchase.  By the way, it comes with a 32MB SD card, which is basically worthless when each 7MP shot is just under 2MB.  So, remember to pick up larger SD card (2GB seems to be working pretty well for us currently - havent tried an HDSC card yet).</Content>

<Content>I purchased this as a backup camera.  Meaning a camera I can haul everywhere I go, mostly for cloud pictures, when I cant carry my Canon PowerShot Pro Series S3 IS 6MP with 12x Image Stabilized Zoom around.  

I picked this camera because it has a few features I hadnt found in other cheaper point and shoot cameras.  In manual mode it has an infinity focus mode, which I havent seen anywhere.  This is excellent for cloud photos, as my other camera could almost never focus on them, but this camera lacks a manual focus, so I wasnt completely sure it would work.  The Infinity Focus completely solved that problem.  

Its other main selling point is an ability for Super Macro, ie focusing on objects almost touching the lens.  It is also found in Manual Mode.   My S3 can do that, but I didnt think I would find a point and shoot with that capability.  Especially since Ive played with some of the more expensive Canon powershots and they DIDNT have the capability.  It makes up for the measly 3.4 optical zoom.  

One feature I havent played with yet is long shutter, also in the manual settings, reached by pressing menu in the Exposure area of the Manual settings.  It looks like it can go up to 5 seconds or so.  Another feature I didnt expect on a camera without Manual Aperture or Shutter Speed adjustments.  

The lack of a viewfinder is a bit irritating, and noticeably a problem in direct sunlight, but the focus modes more than made up for it for me.  

It does have a big lag for flash pics, even with NiMH batteries.  You will HAVE to buy another memory card as at high quality it can take barely 10 pics on the included one.  </Content>

A friend had the Canon A470 and raved about the image quality, simplicity amd price.  Got one from Amazon and love it!!  Not too small and a quick picture taker.  Perfect for someone with rather large hands.  Priced at a little over 100 bucks because it does not have a huge zoom or IS, but it does a great job for basic picture taking.</Content>

<Content>We purchased this camera for our business in lieu of toting our nicer camera for quick property photos. Camera takes a great picture and does video. We havent tested the video just yet. Camera handles dim situations relatively well, not without moderate pixelation, but I am nonetheless impressed.

I have not deciphered how to easily remove mass photos from the camera on my Macintosh. Camera seems to be one-by-one delete. I guess I could drop and dump when the camera is on my desktop downloading photos.

Still playing around with the camera with time I dont have currently to discover all the cool features. Downloading is a snap, and similar to most cameras. I also appreciated the use of a SD memory card. You can buy them anywhere. Love the orange color! Exactly what we wanted.

Fits well in our hands and pockets (a must for us). We didnt want a large camera. For the price I wouldnt be devastated to take this camera as a loss and I have been nothing but pleased to this point with this great little camera. Perfect for our needs of real estate. Clean crisp photo and not an overbearing flash. No big blow-outs of white to discriminate details, but again early on with the camera. Still takes a great well-sized photo and love it. I will take it also on personal trips too. 

Only thing I am not crazy about are the markings of how to hit enter or accept on the camera. It doesnt come naturally with the icons and markings Canon chose. Just something to get used to and not second nature for me yet. Still LOVE this camera.</Content>

<Content>I had a Canon camera that was only a couple of years old, go missing. Even though it had a lot more features, I figured that Id buy a cheap camera to replace it, for now. (Maybe itll still turn up, if not I may get a fancy camera for a replacement later.)

The old one was 5 Mega pixels, the new one is 7 Mega pixels. What is shocking however, is the amount of improvements that were made in digital cameras, in only a couple of years. While the new camera is relatively cheap, it is vastly better than my old one (and the old one was very highly rated, and from the same manufacturer).

While the old camera would take decent pictures, to get the exposure and colors right, I would always run the pictures through Photoshops Auto-correct mode, before printing them out. With the new camera, they have somehow improved the electronics so much that every picture looks good straight out of the camera, without any correction in external software. (The external software will further improve on the pictures, but theyre pretty good, even without touching them up.)

I dont know if I just lucked out with this particular model of camera, or if every new camera is this good. Anyway, when I need another camera, Im not going to waste my money on a high end feature loaded camera. Ill just buy another cheap highly rated  camera in a couple of years, and by then the advances made will more than outweigh the premium that Id have to expend to get a loaded camera, now.

All in all, this camera is a great buy, great value, and cant take a bad picture!</Content>

<Content>I could not be happier with this camera, and you certainly cant beat it for the price. The screen is surprisingly large for a small camera and the quality of the photos is fabulous. I can carry it around in my purse and have it on hand for spontaneous shots. The fact that it uses regular batteries is a blessing and a curse. At least if it runs out and your on vacation and out and about you can buy batteries anywhere instead of having to wait until you can charge it. But the downside is that they seem to get used up fairly quickly.

Im really pleased I got this one and not a more pricey version. I have my Rebel SLR for high ed use and this for everyday. </Content>

<Content>A really great camera,for a first time user. It is easy to use although it takes a little while to get used to how to operate and select the features. Stay away from the Format section - this will delete all your pictures. Also, you will need to buy a new memory card, preferably a 1G, as the one that comes with the camera only holds about 15 pictures. But other than these need to know tips you will enjoy using this camera. It will be good to buy a camera case as it doesnt come with one and you will need something to protect your camera as you carry it around.</Content>

<Content>I have to say, this camera takes INSANELY good quality pictures! For the price, and size, it really can not be beat! I am a fan of Canon Products, and this camera reassures me that I can keep trusting them when it comes to digital photography!

Simple to use, lasts days and days on the batteries, and uses SD memory cards (which my laptops have readers built in for, making it very convenient). The LCD view screen is great! Big, and beautiful! This machine gets rid of the viewfinder, which rarely ever gets used due to their inaccurate nature, and leaves out other frilly features that would only cause issues or break in the future.

I have had very good experience with my history f owning Canon cameras, and this one is as rugged as it should be. As long as you dont beat up on it, it should give you many years of reliable, quality use!</Content>

<Content>I didnt like the modes that it had that sometimes darken your pictures. Its a hassle changing these modes. And the modes that dont darken your picture, the blurry shows so you have to hold the camera very steady. Theres also a choice of it not being blurry even if youre shaking it, but in that case, the camera is slower to take pics and load, and/or would have to be placed back to darken mode. You cant see full screen pics by setting the view mode to View All so it sucks having to see them smaller or you can do the full screen but then it sets to one-by-one. 

And the worse part is the batteries. Its what you get for paying cheap for a camera. I had to buy a Duracell battery charger and even duracell cant last that long before I have to charge it again. I end up having to charge it over just for using it a few hours. So it eats up a lot of power from the batteries. In all, its definitely not the kind of camera Id stick with me for the rest of my life. In that long time, I might buy a new one soon.  </Content>

<Content>The picture quality is good but the lag time between pushing the button especially with the flash making a bright light while it gets ready for the shot destroys any spontaneous shots especially of my animals or child.  It is easy to use and I did not have to do a lot of reading to get it working for me.  My disappointment lies only in the inability to take spontaneous photos and maybe that is just the quality of a digital camera.  Shop around if taking a surprise photo is of importance.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera after my hospital decided to go to a digital camera for wound documentation, after polaroid decided to quit making instant film for its cameras. The camera they decided to adopt was this one. I had my doubts, but after having used it, I really started to like it, and bought one for myself. It is compact, uses AA batteries, and has a supermacro feature. The only bad thing is that there is no flash, or I havent figured out how to use the flash while doing supermacro. Without a tripod, and no flash, not all of the shots could be held still enough in supermacro for sharp shots. I finally figured out how to use a LED pen flashlight to provide enough light for faster shutters peeds in super macro handheld shots.  The images are clear and sharp. From Amazon I took advantage of the 2 GB SD card for free. I have yet to fill one up. This is the camera that goes with me all of the time. A great camera for not so much dough for those of us that like macro shots. </Content>

The only problem I have is that it tends to get blurry in action shots, or if you zoom in too close. I also found that my sister, who has a Nikon camera, has pictures that are sharper and have a better quality. For the price, though, you cant get a better camera.</Content>

Really point and shoot camera.
Not too may options on the Dial to confuse you.
My parents are old, all they want is icon for ,video,and play!
Uses AA battery. I just use rechargeable AA Batteries. Its easy if you travel outside the country.Some countries have 220V or different Plug socket. AA Batteries are easily available.
Picture and video quality is AMAZING!!!
Personally i like little bigger camera and it is easy to hold while taking photos...i dont have to worry about dropping it.

<Content>I bought this camera for my wife because she wanted one that she could easily carry in her purse.  So far, she has found it very easy to use and the pictures have turned out very well.  I personally dont like using the LCD screen as much as I like the viewfinder on my more traditional Fuji camera, but she prefers the LCD anyway.

It isnt loaded with options and there are certainly better cameras out there.  For the price though, this is a great unit so far.</Content>

<Content>We bought this camera for our boys. They had been wanting to take good pictures, but I really cringed when they used my $600 camera. We were hoping this would be perfect for them. (Ages 11, 9,  7). I have to say, its probably right for the price. When the sun is out, you have plenty of time because your subject isnt moving much, then it takes an amazing picture. If it is low light, it is really grainy. If there is a bit of movement (not running or on an amusement ride, just kids walking or playing,) it can be hard to get a decent picture.
For my boys its fine, if it was my only camera I would be incredibly disapointed. I will probably take it on field trips as it is far more compact than my big camera.</Content>

<Content>The Canon A470 has a great price and great features.  I like it better than the older model I had, an A85. The older had only 4mp, and appeared to have many more controls. The A470 takes only 2 AA batts, vs the 4 batts for the A85.   I need a SIMPLE camera. The features for the price are tops.

It takes awesome photos and has video as well!  We didnt realize this when we bought it, so it was a nice bonus for us!  It seems easy to understand and view photos.  I would get this one again!

Recieved this camera yesterday and I am very happy with it so far. Takes great pictures and good video. Its small enough to fit into my purse if need be, and I can still get the great quality from a Canon that I expect. No problems with battery life, but I do use the lithium battery in my camera, so I expect none. Would recommend this camera to anyone. </Content>

<Content>I did alot of research before buying this camera. Being that I am not camera savy I wanted something that I could point and shoot and get brilliant pictures. I was in the market to get the Canon A560 but they were sold out at all the stores in my area. The clerk showed me the A470 and I was instantly impressed by it. The A470 was easy to learn how to use. I downloaded the pictures for the first time today and was impressed by the quality. It doesnt matter if the photos are taken inside or outdoors - the color is vibrant and the image is crisp and clear. I am having so much fun with this camera - probably even driving my kids crazy by taking pictures all the time. I think anyone who purchases this camera will be very happy with it.</Content>

Well, I did not want to spend $85 on Fisher Price Kid Tough Digital Camera - Blue (New Version) that is big and clunky and even though it may be a little tougher, the view screen and picture quality is no match for the Canon PowerShot A470.  

I got a nice small camera case and my son has taken great care of this camera. He used it on our recent vacation and he took great pictures. Have created a web site to share his unique outlook on life.

<Content>i usually love canon cameras, but this camera i was not very happy with.  i have no problem with the pictures coming out good.  the color comes out very nice.  the problem i have with it is the time that it takes to take one picture and then take another.  if your batteries are not fully charged, the wait time to take another pic could be up to 10 seconds.  the zoom can be blurry at times too.  its a good basic camera for someone who takes photos every now and then.  but if its for trips and you want to capture alot of moments, youre gonna miss out on alot by waiting for the batteries to charge up again to take the next pic...</Content>

<Content>For the total price of $113 plus $10 for a Kingston 2GB memory card, this was a great bargain.  You will definitely want to purchase the memory card on amazon as well because the 32MB memory card that comes with this camera will hold maybe 15 pictures or so.  The 2GB memory card for only $10 holds about 1000 pictures.
When this camera arrived to me, I turned it on and it asked for the DATE and TIME.  But when I powered down the camera and then turned it back on later, it again asked for the date/time.  So the camera was not saving the Date/Time.  I opened the battery cover and their is a slot for the CR1220 Date battery which is as small as a watch battery.  IT WAS UPSIDE DOWN.  The + symbol of the battery was facing up and in reality, the - symbol needed to be facing up.  After I flipped around this watch battery, the camera was able to save the Date/Time and it never again asked me for the Date/Time each time I started it up.  I wrote to Canon and requested they retrain their staff with this issue since it caused me alot of headache.  Overall, the camera works great!  Large LCD screen, easy to handle, uses only 2 AA batteries and has 5 different resolutions to choose from when taking pictures, including a widescreen resolution and a Date/Time stamp selection so the date/time get stamped onto each picture you take.  Great camera, the blue color looks sharp!</Content>

<Content>This is a good camera for the price. It is simple to use and takes clear, crisp pictures.  Also, the battery life is good.  And the price makes it affordable to take good pictures.

Just keep in mind, that this camera works well if your subject is stationary.  It is not for action shots.  I have tried to take pictures of my kids playing in the yard and pictures usually come out blurry.  Also, there is a bit of a lag time for the picture to be taken.  Therefore, I have a tendency to miss the shot.

<Content>For the list price ($129.00) I really couldnt find a better camera. I work in a photo processing lab, where I also deal with and sell cameras for most of the day, so before purchasing my own I did a lot of hands-on research playing with and reading about all the cameras that were within the price I wanted to spend.  Im still learning as far as all the fancy features, but if youre like me and just need a good camera for everyday type stuff, this one is perfect.  With its 7.1 mega pixels, it takes really sharp pictures and what I really like is how fast the shutter is. Theres virtually no delay between the time you focus the camera and go to snap the actual picture. That was my biggest problem with my old camera-- Id go to focus in and then by the time I actually snapped the photo, the delay was so annoyingly long that the moment was lost.  The LCD screen is a great size, not too large and not too small. At 2.5, you get a really good idea of what youre shooting, even without a viewfinder.  The only complaint I have is that its not as great outdoors in bright weather. The screen gets really washed out and makes it kind of difficult to get a good shot. This is fixable though, as they sell pop-up shade clips (about $10) you can attach to the camera so as to correct that. I havent tried them personally, but heard they work really well.  I also really like the size of the camera itself. A lot of people are attracted to the super slim tiny cameras you can fit in a pocket, but that didnt appeal to me.  I wanted something Id be comfortable holding, fit well in my hands, and didnt feel like I was going to drop it. Its like the perfect size for me, because its still really compact but not so small that it gives me anxiety over dropping it/breaking something. Alternately, its not so big that I cant easily carry it around with me.  

I would consider this camera a step up from a lot of others in the price range. Along with the scene modes (which is pretty standard on most point and shoots anyway) it has a manual setting, which is fun to play around with and really easy to navigate. For someone like me who is still learning all the technical stuff its a good first camera. You can customize a fair amount but its not overwhelming and hard to learn. At my job we are trained on what are the best selling points, features, etc, and whereas I take that into mind I also know that everyone is picky in their own way and some people care about certain features more than others. Personally I just wanted something to use on vacations, to take pictures of friends and I, my cats, etc.  If you want something for fast action scenarios, sporting events and the like, you might want to skip this camera. Its only got the standard 3.4 optical zoom, which really is not that far, and even though it zooms farther digitally...it will get more blurry the further in you go.  That is one thing Canon needs to improve upon-- a lot of their lower end models like this one have poor image stabilizing.  

Canons face detection technology is pretty cool though.  In Auto mode (and probably manual too, Im not positive though) it actually locks onto a persons face and almost highlights it...like zooms just their face in so you can see if its clearly focused before taking the pic. This is a feature you can turn on or off in the Menu settings.  It throws you off a bit in relation to the rest of the photo, but once you get the hang of it its really helpful (in group shots especially.)

Bottom line - great deal for the price!  You see a lot of Nikons (Coolpix series) in the $89-129 price range, but in my experience this newer Canon definitely surpasses them. I had a Nikon Coolpix 5600 (probably about 2 yrs old now), and whereas it took beautifully sharp photos, the lag time was incredibly slow and thats what made me like this Canon better. Faster shutter times make all the difference! Canons photo software is easier to navigate as well, with more custom settings to play around with when you want to edit/share your pictures on your computer.  Most people are surprised to learn what kind of camera I have after theyve seen the photos it takes.  I just think its really nice that you can get something of this quality for such a low price.  

OH- And a note about the AA batteries for this Canon:  Obviously if you use standard alkaline AAs your response time is going to be a lot slower. Investing in good quality rechargeables is more than worth the money, it makes all the difference.  I myself prefer Energizers Lithium batteries, the blue and silver ones, as oppose to the rechargeables...just because they are specially designed for high powered devices like digital cameras, and you dont have to mess around with a charger, or the whole rotating batteries in and out.  I got a good couple months of use out of a set of two, while taking pictures frequently...on a trip, and even just in everyday daily use.  Its about $5 for a two pack and $9 for 4.  </Content>

<Content>We have a Canon Camera, but its larger and heavier than the Powershot A470.  I wanted something small that I could either put in my pocket or bag.  This camera fits that description and more.  Its easy to set, focus and shoot! The pictures are clear and sharp.  Recently though, I downloaded pictures into a digital picture frame.  I was disappointed that some of the pictures had dark background and were fuzzy, but I think that it was more fault of the picture frame than the camera.  Im returning the digital frame for a larger one.  All-in-all, I love my new camera and highly recommend it for someone who just wants an easy-to-use and carry-around type of camera.</Content>

I recommend getting rechargeable batteries for this camera as I have been told you only get three to four hours of use for every two you put in. 
Other than that I love it! Good color and I love that when you turn the camera a different direction the picture formats accordingly.</Content>

<Content>We have several Maintenance men who need cameras out in the field. We typically used Polaroid film, but with that going away, I needed something digital for the not-so-tech-minded guys. This camera does exactly what I need. It has larger buttons and is bulky in the hand, so they can use the cameras with gloves on. It takes AA Batteries, which is another plus - I dont have to follow up with a guy to make sure he charged a battery, or when something is urgent, I wont hear he forgot to charge it up.  The only BAD thing about the camera is the weak battery door. It seems flimsy and looks as though it could break easily.  I am not too worried about it though, as the cameras are inexpensive, and with careful operation, it should work out well. Overall, its a great camera for what I need, simple, reliable and large (Not a lot of shooting options, but I dont want those for this purpose. It meets our needs).</Content>

<Content>Took about 600 vacation photos with the A470 about a week after I got it and I was very satisfied with the results. On a handful of shots it didnt seem to focus properly, but by looking the shot on the screen after I took it, I know that I wanted to snap another shot in those few instances. The image stabilization worked well - I didnt have too much trouble due to camera shake, despite having to hold it at arms length to take pix, rather than look through a viewfinder which I had been accostomed to. Shot almost everything at 5 Mpixel rather than 7 MP, though I did use the widescreen mode a couple dozen times, which I was very happy with. It came in handy for some wide landscapes  tall objects that I shot. Of course, its easy to crop a digital image, but its also nice to have the widescreen mode built in to the camera.</Content>

<Content>I was attracted to this camera as a new version of the A460, which was highly rated by PC World. It is indeed very simple to use with a large LCD display, much greater resolution than the A70 I bought five years ago, and uses a 2 GB memory chip. The drawback is that the camera has no view finder. You take a picture by looking at it in the LCD display. That works fine indoors, but outdoors the daylight washes out the display so that framing a picture is almost guesswork.Canon PowerShot A470 7MP Digital Camera with 3.4x Optical Zoom (Red)</Content>

The results are pretty good. (How do I know? Because Ive actually gotten to use all of these cameras. I earn my living at Walt Disney World writing a travel guide, and nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShots.)

Heres my opinion of the top-selling A series cameras:

7TH PLACE: Featuring Canons acclaimed Digic III processor, the 2007-model A560 includes the companys face-detection metering system and a decent red-eye removal. Its a nice camera, but a better value is the new A470 (see below). $150 list.

6TH PLACE: The A570IS is the same camera as the A560 but with optical image stabilization and the ability to shoot manually. $200 list.

5TH PLACE: You can do a lot with the sweet little A630. Its a 2006 model, but has a flip-out LCD panel and lots of manual controls. The shots Ive seen from this model look great. Keep your ISO under 800 and you wont get any noise. $350 list. (Canon offers a 2007 version of this camera that I havent had much experience with yet, the A650 IS. It also lists for $350.)

4TH PLACE: The 2008-model A580 is an A590IS (see 1st Place, below) without image stabilization and with semi-automatic instead of manual controls. $150 list.

3RD PLACE: The fully-loaded A720 IS has all the toys, including a 6x zoom (35mm film equivalent of 35-210mm), image stabilization, adjustable flash power and optional second-curtain flash. This last feature means you can make the flash fire at the end of a long exposure, instead of the beginning, so moving subjects streak into focus instead of out. A 2007 model. $200 list.

2ND PLACE: The 2008 entry-level A470 (the camera on this page) is great for kids or anyone just looking for a good basic camera. But frankly, its better than basic. It includes Canons face detection technology and has a zoom lens, 14 shooting modes and the ability to set exposure compensation, ISO and white balance manually. Plus it looks great with the color inserts. Everyone with this little camera always seems to be having fun. $130 list. 

1ST PLACE: The A590IS is the A580 (see 4th Place, above) with image stabilization and with the option of full manual controls. For an extra $30 those features are well worth it. I bought this model for myself. $180 list.</Content>

<Content>  I purchased and have been using the Cannon Powershot A590-IS with very good success. I needed photos of jewelry  gemstones up close with white or black backgrounds, and the Powershot delivered. For the price, I would say it is definitely one of the top 5 best cameras.
  Down sides of the camera is that it eats batteries and you will need an AC adaptor plug in to shoot very many images.
  Also, for even better jewelry close ups, I recommend buying the additional close up lens but this is not absolutely necessary. The camera will take good close ups just the way it is.
A good bargain for the price. I do recommend.</Content>

<Content>This is a great camera that is easy to use and has long battery life.  I sell on eBay so a camera that takes clear pictures is a necessity, so when my former camera quit working I researched and discovered that I could purchase this new Canon for not much more than repair costs for the old one.  I found the Canon on Amazon.com and received it 2 days after I ordered it!  Great deal.</Content>

<Content>I bought the camera in January 2009 and got the dreaded lens error in April 2009.  Since it was under warranty, I sent it back to Canon, and they replaced the parts for free.  Since then, the lag time has seemed to double.  I feels like almost 10 second before I can take another shot, which is longer than it was before they fixed it.  Im a little nervous its going to fail again.  It takes good low light pictures, which is what I was looking for.  And the scenery pictures are good too.  I got it for $100 on amazon, which was a good deal.  But, be warned.  Keep the box it came in for when you need to send it back.</Content>

<Content>Bought this camera as a present to my son before his trip to the far east. I looked for a reliable and advanced camera. I have  several Canonj SLR and as such assumed that the A590 is a natural candidate.
To our regret, after being in use for 2 months, the lens retractor ceased to work and the camera had to be repaired. Of course, as it was bought in the US, the warranty was uselees. We had to pay. Second time, the shutter had to be readjusted and we paid again.
Pictures are good and the 8MP render very clear and sharp photos. Pitty we had to spend time to fix it twice. It is not an easy job when one traveles on the far east countryside.</Content>

<Content>This is one Awesome Camera ! 

Ive already used this camera indoors, outdoors, in the woods, at the beach, in an Aquarium, in light and dark situations, and everything in between. 
Quick boot up / start up time, Auto settings, easy setting, well placed controls and menus, Full Manual for those who like to use their talent in photography. 
Easy to pack and carry and use. 
Great pictures, great color and resolution, just an all around sweet sturdy little workhorse of a camera. 

I was really surprised when I tried the video mode at the Aquarium, even in low light, in the glass tunnel under the shark tank, I got Awesome video With Sound ! That video is now a favorite of the Grand-kids AND Grandma ! :)

Uses easy to find SD cards and AA batteries, I recommend this camera to everyone ! 

A 2 GB SD card holds over 500 pictures at Max size and resolution.

As others have mentioned, normal alkaline batteries die fast in this camera...get the rechargeable Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries, found at Walmart, KMart, Walgreens, even in grocery stores. 

Great Product, Great Price, and no issues with Amazon marketplace vendor Adorama Cameras product, delivery, or service.

@ Steven T Crowley
By the Way, this camera does have a timer. 
As you would have seen in the manual, the timer is in the function set menu settings, Driver mode. 
There is a 2 second timer, a 10 sec timer, and one you can custom set.

One of the beauties of this camera, one can point n shoot with it straight out of the box.
And one could read the manual and discover the huge abundance of advanced settings this camera has. 

Truly a camera for all types !</Content>

Get a high capacity high quality sdhc card. I have 8gb in each (shoot avi. video I am very pleased. the people who received them as gifts really enjoyed them but one was sent back due to mistaken low voltage triggered by using the cheap panasonic AAs enclosed.

<Content>I have been a fan of Canon cameras for nearly 10 years and have purchased 4 of them over time.  They have all performed well.  Everything is easy to use, it has a good feel in the hand.  If there is any negative on this camera, it is the time it takes to write the picture to the SD card.  It seems to take too long in this function.  Also, have been having a difficulty getting it to focus in low light conditions.  But if I switch to movie mode, then it has no problems capturing what I am trying to get.</Content>

<Content>What happened? I got this directly from Amazon a year ago, on sale, for around [...] bucks shipped. And now its two and a half times that price? Strange.

In any case, its a fabulous little camera. Very reliable, great lense and zoom, easy to use, sturdy, attractive, small, light; with a 16 gb card you can store literally thousands of 8mp shots on one little card. Sorry, Walgreens and Kodak!

But the very best thing is that it takes only two AA batteries. Simply buy four or six rechargeables (they pay for themselves in weeks!) and a 15-minute charger, take the charged extras along, and youre good for days of shots. The flash wears out the batteries far faster, of course.

There is not one bad thing I can say about this camera...except that the price is too high here. Look around and find a better one. Hey, dont blame me, Amazon: when you offer great value then take it away, customers will notice.

As for Canon: you guys are still making state of the art cameras at a very fair price, and I salute you for it. Real quality makes its own friends, as the other reviews here will attest. Funny how the best usually rises to the top. As it should.

I highly recommend this camera...at about [...] bucks.

<Content>I bought this camera specifically to take close up pictures to upload onto my etsy shop.  [...] if you want to see how well the pictures come out.  They are awesome.  The only problems I have so far is short battery life (Im not sure if thats my fault for not turning the camera off??), and the pixels were actually too big for etsy.  Reading the owners manual showed me clearly how to change the pixels, and it even displays the pixels on the camera in case you forget what the symbol stands for.  The pictures for my shop were taken with the flash off, and macro (flower icon) on.  

It also takes nice crisp photos of the family, red eye doesnt seem to be much of a problem, and the images all look really good - even when I was just taking practice snapshots of my husband on the computer, kids giving me silly looks, etc.  

My aunts, both artists and photographers, both have this camera as well and highly recommended it to me.  One aunt pointed out how easy it is to use the buttons - they are well placed on the camera.  Consumer reports also had good things to say about the Powershot.</Content>

<Content>Years ago, I bought a Canon Powershot and was incredibly disappointed by the quality of photos it took. After that, I stayed far, far away from Canon. However, I read so many good things about this camera, that I decided to take the chance and purchase it.

I am truly surprised at just how much Canon has packed into this little camera. Not only does it have far more options than I would ever use, the photo quality is sharp and flawless. With my previous Canon the photos had a light pink color around the edges. With this camera there is none of that.

For a camera to take everywhere, I highly recommend the A590.</Content>

<Content>Last January, I bought a Canon PowerShot G-10 to be my new flagship camera (see my review for this product).  I was so impressed with it, that when I was looking for a sidekick to this camera,  I decided to stick with Canon, and bought a PowerShot A590IS (both cameras bought from Amazon).  The A590IS is a pretty good camera with a good set of features and a menu and operation that are consistent with the G10. Its pictures are quite good, and Im hard pressed to tell the difference in the pictures taken by both cameras.  The camera is well built with a good quality plastic case, fits well in the hand and can be carried in a pocket.  It may not be my #1 camera, but its a great little camera in its own right.

<Content>The Powershot A4 (now A5) series is the only point-and-shoot digital I will ever buy.  But its my 4th one in 4 years - thats an average of 1 per year!  My history, in brief:  
- We bought a competitors camera, which broke in 8 months (zoom lens got off track), fixed it, then broke again 5 months later.
- We bought our first Powershot, then left it on the train. (Whoops!)
- Got another one, then dropped it on stone in the Kaibab Natl Forest in AZ (Whoops!)  This one, however, was packaged with a Selphy photo printer (Bonus!)
- Got a third one, which had a bigger viewing screen and more megapixels, but then after dropping a few times, a screw came loose inside and shorted out the circuit board so it wouldnt turn on - I found this by taking it apart after finding out the 1-year warranty expired.
- Since the repair cost was $100, and I found out I could get the newer version for just a little more than that, I opted for the new version.

I like this level of Powershot (in particular, the A590) for 3 reasons:  1) its a good point and shoot with decent start-up time and recover times (except with flash on full power); 2) it has MANUAL mode to set your own F-stop, Aperture, and flash intensity, along with ISO and white balance, etc. - even manual focus; 3) it uses AA batteries (we use rechargable AA batts) and SD memory cards, which work with every other device we have.  If the rechargeables go out while were away, I can just buy AA batts anywhere.

You can read about the features - just warning that the flash recovery time is fairly slow (at least 10 seconds) in your Auto or Easy mode.  For this reason, I frequently use manual mode with low-intensity flash and 2.6 F-stop with 1/40 sec shutter speed for twilight conditions.

You can collect a lot of data on your picture automatically, and the camera can remove redeye and crop shots, also you can analyze how well the picture came into focus.

Also, a note - only the (current) A5xx (past) A4xx series Powershots have a clip on the front that comes off to add aftermarket accessories such as filters, wide-angle lenses, etc.

In all, for this price, you get a top-notch camera that is NOT the best but is certainly by far the best, most reliable, and feature-full camera in this price range.  My other camera is a film-based SLR.</Content>

<Content>We bought this camera as a replacement for the A75 at Xmas for our son.  The first thing we noticed is the depletion of batteries.  They seem to drain very quickly.  The A75 used 4 re-chargeable batteries and lasted a long time.  This one eats batteries, even though, I suppose 2 shouldnt last as long as 4 these dont last at all. I havent figured out what to do for our upcoming trip.  Ill probably have to lug 2 digital and one cam on the trip. Along with beaucoup batteries.  Were gong cross country this is going to be a pain. Im glad it isnt just my imagination, but a real problem.  Ill have to wait to have Canon fix it as the trip in in less than 10 days.  We had the A75 ccd problem fixed after a similar trip 2 years ago and ruined photos of one of a kind that couldnt replicated.  This should be fun.</Content>

I also like very much the viewfinder because the screen is next to useless in bright sunlight. I also bought a 4 GB memory stick, good for up to 2000 pictures depending on the pixel setting. And for the price at $125.00 I would buy it again.</Content>

<Content>Bought this camera about a yr. ago.  GREAT pictures HOWEVER, it has started to complain about low battery.  It then shuts off.  Repeatedly replaced batteries of proper type and camera still complains.  Searching the internet reveals others having the same problem.  Took problem to Canon customer service.  They suggest sending the camera to a service center to be looked at.  AND BTW they have no service bulletins on this problem (even tho you can find MANY similar problems on the internet).  AND of course you will foot the bill for shipping and they probably will find something wrong of which you will pay that bill also.  

Canon is not owing up to the fact that they have a problem here.

<Content>I am extremely pleased with this product.  The picture quality is excellent and the controls are much easier to use than my former camera (Panasonic). The instuction book is well written, with a couple of exceptions:
1) The camera comes with a very small memory card which limits the number of pixels that can used in an image.  This results in images with appreciable pixel noise.  The instruction book fails to mention that the memory card limits the number of pixels per image that can be set.  (The camera should be supplied with a larger memory for only a small increase in price). In any event the purchase of a larger memory should be a #1 item for the new user.
2) I failed to see any warning about leaving the camera in a hot environment such as in a car parked in the sun.
3) The focusing mechanism looks like it could be damaged by grit getting into the mechanism.  (Keep it out of sand storms). </Content>

<Content>I looked at a lot of reviews before deciding to purchase this camera. My five star rating is earned because of the number and quality of features for a good price. To get many features found on the A590IS, I was expecting to spend a whole lot more money.
Ive used the camera for a vacation and a couple of hiking trips and have been very pleased with the results. I especially like that it uses AA batteries and have found that using rechargeable batteries work great and save money. I purchased extra memory and find it easy to switch it out.

<Content>I have to admit that this was the first digital camera I have owned and I wish I had bought one sooner. Some of the first pictures I took were at Bellingrath Gardens and they came out great. The manual that came with the camera was easy to understand, even though there are some functions that I will probably never use. If all else fails I just switch to the easy function and point and shoot. It couldnt be simpler. I like the fact that the camera uses 2 AA batteries, which you can get anywhere. I took about 250 picures before I changed the batteries. I think this would be a good camera for anyone who is a novice like myself.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera a few weeks before Christmas. Its features, menu options, and zoom and face detection worked very well and were easy to use. Red-eye was reduced in the pictures, but still noticeable. Auto-stabilization was an excellent feature too. The video camera feature on this camera is excellent also. You can zoom in and out, which you cant do with the video feature on some other cameras. However, with all of these features comes a price (and I dont mean the price of the camera). I mean the price of batteries. It goes through batteries like a baby goes through diapers. A quick fix to this is to buy rechargable batteries. Even if you purchase Energizer or Duracell batteries, they do not last long (3-4 hours at the most). Also, you may want to be careful of the extending lens. Four months after I purchased this camera, the lens motor broke and it wouldnt focus or extend out anymore. I bought a new camera since the cost of fixing it would have been equivelant. Overall, this is an excellent camera, very easy to operate, and very cool to play around with. Just be careful with battery life and the lens motor.</Content>

<Content>Amazing little camera! not to compact - if youre looking for a nice small pc camera that fits inside the pocket and doesnt look like a body anomaly you should probably get another model. I had experience with sd1000 if thats the name, way more compact, but has a very limited manual mode and costs 200$ (aprox.) Ive got a590is so I could begin taking photos using its semi and fully adjustable manual modes and learn about photography, and the price was absolutely unbeatable regarding the quality and functionality of the camera.

Best buy for photography beginners, and a compact camera for the whole family :)  


Pros: Great camera, non-understandable low price, manual mode works like a charm - white balance, focus, colors, exposure... nice photos all in all.

Cons: if it counts, not an ultra-compact camera, its big for majority of pockets.</Content>

<Content>I bought mine a couple of months back and Im totally satisfied with the camera. The picture quality is excellent. I think it has the best manual mode with total control over all the parameters, in this price range. It comes with a 32MB SD card so you would want to buy a larger (preferably 2-4GB) card if you dont already have one. Also, a good charger and quality NiMH batteries would be a wise investment to save money in the longer run. Overall a very good camera for its price!</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera so my wife could break into digital photography.  She wanted a digital PS that had an optical finder.  There are not too many of these--Canon is the only one I could think of, and not even all canons have an optical finder. Some just have the LCD screen.

I tried a few shots at home before we left on a trip to Europe.  It seemed to be working all right, so we took it along.  She also brought her trusty Olympus Stylus film camera, just in case.

Heres what we found out:  first, the camera turned out to be a battery eater.  According to the instructions, you should get about 200 shots on a pair of AA alkalines.  Well, my wife got more like 30 or 40.  One set of batteries was good for about 4 to 6 hours of shooting.  She couldnt get a whole day of shooting out of it, even though she turned the camera off when not shooting.  Fortunately, I had several sets of spares along.  When these ran out, I bought four Kodak AA alkalines in a Paris store.  They were gone in a couple of days, so we made a shopping thrip and bought some German batteries.  They were maybe a little better--she shot for several hours in the Musee de lOrangerie.  

I am thinking the camera may be defective.  No chance to follow up on that yet, as we just got back.

I had a scare:  the pictures viewed on the LCD screen had an out of focus look.  I worried that all her pictures might be bad.  But the good news is that after downloading to the computer, her shots, viewed on my 17 monitor,  are tack sharp!  A fine lens!  There were only 2 or 3 unsharp shots out of 579 total, and they are probably ther result of operator error.

I can also say Im very favorably impressed with the Canons color management.  Good, satisfying color that does not disappoint.

I dont think the dynamic range from highlight to shadows is very great.  The camera, in the hands of an amateur with no time to learn photography, produced quite  few blown highlights on scenes that ranged from shadow to bright sky areas, and definitely favors the shadows, which remain readable at the expense of blown highlights.  Probably an exposure tweak toward the underexposure side would help things a lot.  Of course, almost all digitals are limited in this regard; point-and-shoots perhaps more so than DSLRs.  

So, summing up:

Image quality:  Excellent, for such a small camera.

Color management:  Very good.

Exposure latitude:  could be better.

Ease of use:  pretty good!

Battery life:  A big problem with our sample.  We may or may not have a defective sample, and this needs to be followed up on.  Ill try to post a followup note when I find out more.</Content>

<Content>Canon makes some of the highest quality stuff out there. In addition to this one, I also have a Canon A60 camera made in 2002-2003. It is STILL working great. I would never even consider another brand. I have had to deal with their tech support as well, and I found it to be fantastic.

The A590 has several improvements over the older version including the smaller number of batteries to operate (2 vs 4 for the old one). And of course the picture quality has improved a lot. Photos (especially night shots) are clearer now. It is also faster when saving photos to memory and when focusing, thanks to the newer digital processing unit (DIGIC 3 vs DIGIC 1). The body looks the same as the older version however (which is not a bad thing!). 

Just buy it. I cannot recommend this camera enough. :)</Content>

<Content>I bought the camera for my wife in the begining of the school year, she is a preschool teacher and loves to make collages of the kids and print them on large format photo paper and post or give the parents. This camera exceeded all expectations. Very good quality even indoors in a not well lit class room. The clarity is amazing and she loves the wide angel. Last week she tried the video and we were totally blown away. I mean on a digital camera the pictures are good but video is usually substandard. Not on this camera. It is great. Of course now she is making DVDs of the kids for the year book and she is having a blast. Even the sound pick up is not bad, although she is using a Karaoke box and mic to amplify the sound in the room. Not bad for the price. We havent even used most of the bells and whistles on this thing but we will.</Content>

<Content>I am a complete novice photographer looking for a snap shooter that would help me take better photos.  I have no idea how or why I would want to set an F stop (to give you a better idea of my skill level).

After reading through the manual and using some of the different predefined settings, I was able to snap some pretty acceptable photos.  I really like the face identification feature.  It helps.  

You do need to be judicious with the digital zoom.  A little too much and, well, grainy would be the best description of the outcome. 

All in all, the camera is easy to use and does a pretty good job

<Content>I bought this camera for my wife two months ago.  Weve taken lots of photos since then and been very happy with the results, especially given the great price (under $120 on Amazon - now being offered at some of the big box stores for under $100 as the new model has been introduced). We just wanted a simple point and shoot that was small enough to carry around.  The Canon is not quite as flat and sexy as some of the others, but it is feature laden and effortlessly takes good pictures. My only gripe design-wise is the dial for changing the settings does not function as smoothly as I would prefer, in fact it is a little clunky.  Unfortunately, last week it started making an unpleasant clicking noise when zooming, I assume it is a broken gear in the focusing motor.  Now we get to see how Canon repair service works.  If we have any nightmares Ill update this posting.  </Content>

I am not a professional photographer, but I am learning more about photography and consider myself a hobbyist. I love to photograph my dolls that I collect, customize and sew clothes for, and this camera takes the best closeups and macro shots I have ever seen in a point and shoot camera. I purchased an inexpensive tripod to minimize the shake for macro shots, and I have had some very clear closeups as a result. It is a truly amazing little camera for the price- I am surprised Canon sells them so cheap!</Content>

The quality of the video was grainy too.  I returned this camera and instead bought another Canon (SX 110 IS) for $100 more.  It was worth the extra money as the processing is faster and the video quality is clearer.</Content>

<Content>I had a Nokia digital camera for a couple of years.  I dont have much knowledge and wanted a camera where I could easily use the auto mode.  Well, the pictures always came out too dark even when a flash was used.  Luckily I dropped the camera and broke the lens for it made me do in depth research before I purchased this little gem of a camera.

I needed a workable camera for a New York City trip and I heard good things about Canon as well as this camera in particular.  I am thrilled with my purchase.  It is a small camera that is also very sturdy and an excellent piece of equipment.  Many electronic items now come with cds to read the manual.  This one actually came with many manuals and they were lenghthy and definitely user friendly.  Everything is described in full detail from first set up of the camera to the great enhancement features this camera possesses.

But luckily for me I was able to go to New York and use the camera in the auto mode and it took amazing puctures whether it be day or night, cloudy or sunny.  The detail is amazing and color is crisp.  Whem I the pictures to mt computer again there were easy to follow instructions provided.  Everything about this camera is A+ and I cant wait to explore the more advanced enhacements it has.  No item is perfect and people are complaining about the battery life with the camera.  I have had no such problem.  I own a 4 AA battery rechargeable kit and I put freshly charged batteries into the camera and went 5 days, taking over 200 pictures without the batteries needing to be changed.  Now 2 more weeks have gone by and those same batteries are running strong.

With so many oprtions out there with electronics it is very important to go by others experience using the item and really read their opinions to see what applies to you.  For me this camera receives the highest grade.  I can use the auto mode as I desire for perfect pictures and there are many great additional features to utilize as I progress as a photographer.  I now also trust Canon and learned my lesson about Nokia.  Canon is reliable and this product comes well packaged with all the instructions you need.

Highly recommend this superb digital camera. </Content>

<Content>This is my first digital camera.  At age 70, there was a lot to learn but I enjoyed learning.  The information booklets helped me install the software, load the memory card, take my first pictures, and print them out.  Consumer Reports had recommended the Canon Powershot camera and Amazon.com had a very good price with free shipping.  Im so pleased with the camera and the equipment that came with it.  I cant compare it with any other digital camera because this is my first one but Im glad I chose it.  I will probably buy another memory card for use when taking several pictures without erasing.  It has performed so well for me that I gave it a five star rating.  This isnt intended to be a detailed rating of each function of the camera just a review from a satisfied customer.

<Summary>Review of Canon Powershot A590 Digital Camera</Summary>
</Review>
<Review>
<DocID>B0011ZCDKS-65</DocID>
<Content>I have several DSLRs and many high-end lenses, but need something to carry with me on a daily basis. When my beloved Fuji F31 died, I needed a replacement and didnt want to spend a lot of money on a PS that would only see occasional use. Based on all the rave reviews of this camera and lts low price I decided to give it a try. 

First off, I notice that some reviewers are comparing this camera to much more expensive ones such as the A650 and deciding that the 590 comes up short. Considering the price difference (125.00 vs. over 500.00) Im not sure this is fair. And comparing it to a DSLR is not worth commenting on.
 
But anyway, on to this camera.

- Image Quality: (always most important) - at ISO 80 or 100, image quality is excellent. The lens is nice and sharp. No complaints, in fact Im pleasantly surprised. IS allows hand-held exposures at slow shutter speeds without flash, so you can use low ISO with less light. This is a good thing, because at anything over ISO 100 the image starts to degrade quickly. Id say 200 is acceptable, anything over that stay away. My Fuji was the king (queen?) of high ISO, this camera falls over badly.

- Controls: Amazing array of manual controls including Aperture priority, shutter priority, full manual, exposure compensation, flash compensation(!), spot metering, control of in-camera sharpening, contrast, and saturation, etc. Manual focus is actually usable, and the viewfinder magnifies the center of the image for easier focusing. Lots of good features for macro photography. There is really nothing left to be desired, in fact there is almost too much, this is just a partial list.

Negatives:

Build: While build feels ok to me, the battery door is rather flimsy. In order to get the card out, you must open the battery compartment and if you are not careful the batteries will fall out. You quickly learn to cope with this however.

High ISO: Mentioned above. Not really useful over 200.

Battery Life: Sucks. Pardon my language. The worst I have ever seen. My Fuji specialized battery lasted FOREVER on a single charge. Dont believe the specs, they are wildly optimistic. Plan on buying rechargeables.

Overall Rating: Considering the price, the image quality at low ISO, and the level of controls, this camera is an amazing value. The biggest drawback is the battery life. I leave it to each of you to decide whether the high ISO is important to you: if it is, dont buy this camera.

<Content>Got a Xmas Canon a590is for my girlfriend, K. Also looked at some of the cool, super thin cameras (like the Sony), but I really wanted the optical viewfinder, photo setting features, AA batteries,  SD chip. K has a trigger finger thumb and dropped it .. hard .. onto tile floor which bent  ruined the extended lens. Canon support was great - sent it in and upon inspection it was, as I thought, unrepairable. So I bought another (also from Amazon). Fantastic camera. K wanted something easy and NOTHING IS EASIER than the easy setting on this camera. Then she took a class, and discovered that the a590is can do everything the instructor covered for advanced techniques. Pictures are terrific. We always put on the camera strap now, but if it gets dropped again, Ill get another. She uses NiMH slow discharge batteries (like Sanyo Eneloop) and carries a spare pair, but has not had any battery life problems, even with display and flash on most of the time - although the class taught her to use the flash only when needed now.  </Content>

<Content>I am very satisfied with the Canon PowerShot A590 IS. I read many reviews of many digital cameras and I found this one to have the most features I wanted for the price. This camera takes great pictures indoors and out. The 4x zoom is great. Nice close-ups. I am glad I read the directions though. When in auto mode you have to be sure and pause halfway when pushing the shutter button so the camera can focus. Otherwise, blurry picture. I love the video feature, which I didnt even expect, I now use all the time. With the software it comes with you can take stills from any frame of a video. I did buy an accessory kit to go with it because the memory card it came with only held a few pictures and I wanted rechargable batteries. I have had it for about a month and use it all the time. For $109 it was a steal.</Content>

<Content>I got this camera in May. But I notice theres fine line on battery compartment cover (door). I thought it was just line like paint line or line from factory... but it came more loose (look like crack become more more crack)until it chipped off.

I sent it for a repair, requested them just to replace the cover. But when I got an email from them, they asked me to pay 99 dollars for just that!?! With that amount I will be better off buy new camera. DUH!

I called them about my warranty, etc, they think I dropped camera but I didnt. I keep it in my camera bag and in my purse all the time. Its new, in great care. They tried to get away with it so I decline the repair but they tried to offer me 20 percent off but I refused, they offer more off until they offter 50 percent off... in my mind, I thought why trying to offer me that than do the honest answer... I did contact them before but they said none about flat rate. They said Okay you have warranty then send it to us for repair.

I dont think its fair to me. Just that dishonest trick they pulled on me. So be bewared of them.

<Content>First of all, going from a 3 Megapixel camera I bought five years ago and found totally adequate to finally getting this 8-Megapixel wonder is an incredible experience.  The fact that I paid 1/3 less for this camera than my previous digital snap-shooter makes the experience even more incredible!
It does everything as advertised for the tyro AND advanced photographer. Put it on Auto and you just press the button and an acceptable image appears on the LCD screen and goes into memory.  Go through the Menu, set white balance, maximum resolution, aperture or shutter speed and youve got the potential of producing a really good shot.
As the title for this review suggests, however, there is one thing about this camera that I found disturbing.  Its the press the shutter button half way to focus then press all the way to take the picture maneuver that is not overridable in the Menu.  This may not be a problem if the purchaser is the only one using this camera, but give it to a complete stranger to take a picture of you and the wife in front of the Golden Gate Bridge and you are going to end up with a picture that will probably be out of focus.  Lets face it, the average Joe you give the camera to to take a picture of you will have no idea of what youre talking about when you instruct him on proper shutter button etiquette.
A second, minor thought.  After reading the instruction book thoroughly, one is left with the impression that the largest capacity SD card it will accept is a 512 Megabyte job.  Which is not true.  I loaded an 8 Gigabyte, Sandisk Ultra III card into the slot and it works perfectly.
All in all, I would recommend this camera to snap-shooter and advanced photographer alike.  Just dont toss the thing to a fellow tourist to take a picture of you unless you want the image to be out of focus.   </Content>

The size is excellent, the viewscreen is perfect, the quality of pictures is spectacular, the zoom is very handy, it lasts quite a while on one set of batteries though when they start getting low you may lose the date. All in all I would say this is the best camera to get for a daily use camera for family shots and other fun things.</Content>

<Content>I bought this A590IS after I returned the A1000IS (10 megapixel version), which had a terrible amount of noise. This A590 is 8MP, and has a little bit less noise than the A590IS. But it is still unacceptable for indoor shots, even at ISO 80. Most pictures look grainy.

I had chosen this camera because it is one of the few with a viewfinder, has AA battery support, and SDHC card support - I own many rechargeable AAs and SDHC cards that I use in my Pentax K200D DSLR, my primary camera. I was looking for a secondary lighter camera. The A590IS isnt it, unfortunately.

Much older cameras with fewer megapixels, like my Olympus C3030Z, or Nikon Coolpix L1, never had this kind of problem.

The A590IS is a prime example of Canon trying to pack too many megapixels into a tiny sensor.

The only reason I kept this camera is that I bought it with 2 printers that were free after rebate and worth $100 each. If it werent for them, I would have returned this camera too.

I still do not know what else to buy as a replacement, since good PS options with viewfinders seem to be very limited these days.

<Content>I took this camera on my recent trip to Disneyland, and it did a great job. The price is fair, and battery life is terrific. I used monster cable rech batts, and never needed to charge them in 5 days of modest use. My 8 gig card will hold nearly 4000 shots at max quality, and we took over 400. Image stabilizer worked well however, very fast motion will still blur. Rarely the focus seems to be unable to locate anything to lock on, and results in a out of focus shot. This was annoying, but didnt happen often. I can see where the zoom lens could get jammed if the camera was turned on in its case, but I always put it in review mode so I am not concerned with the jamming I have heard complaints about.  </Content>

<Content>[...].

I know its probably a bit too late to write reviews for an end-of-life product, but I got mine on clearance sales. The camera is the last of the legendary A series: bargain basement prices packed with pro-sumer features like manual exposure control and AF. Coupled with CHDK, it presents an unbeatable value. 

The latest A series seems to have removed all the manual controls, dumbing it down as a cheap low end point and shoot camera, for good reasons: youll have to pay up for those controls, which is now available only starting from the SX line.

Other fortes have been harped ad nauseam, so I will not elaborate. My problem with this camera has been its quality control, and in particular optical quality. I have bought mine on clearance from Staples in about February of 2009, loaded CHDK, and shoot away. The camera appears to be fine, except the image has a severely blurred out upper left corner. So severe you can see in even small images.

I tried to overlook the problem, since it worked well otherwise. However, I couldnt get over it, since it is just too obvious and too fatal a flaw (what good are the features if image quality doesnt deliver?). So I got another one at another sale. 

The new one had weird clicking noises when lens zoomed out at power-on, and isnt as smooth when zooming. There were also some scratches on the body, and weird black gunk on the lens barrel. The image results also showed a severe blurring across the entire top 15% of the image, which is quite bad. I exchanged that one, and the new one had similar lens clicking noise when power-on, also not as smooth as the older one I had when zooming, but it wasnt as bad. Still, I thought Id probably got the best copy from my first purchase, and should be content.

That is until I did a side by side comparison of the images they took, since I got the new one to see if that would take care of the corner blurriness problem. Quite to my shock, it is better across the entire field: simply much sharper. I have posted one of the side-by-side results on amazons user images (right now its the last of over a hundred images..:P) I also posted results at my flickr: http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=test%20canonw=87084332@N00

The tests were conducted using identical controls, and all attempts have been made to eliminate factors that may skew results. It was extracting the difference in optical performance, and only that.

Between the clicking noise and poor image quality, I ended up keeping the one with better image. However, the quality issues left me feeling short-changed, and that I just couldnt win with either. The excellent value package is thus marred with questionable quality, which is a shame indeed.</Content>

<Content>I had PowerShot A80 for a long time (5+ years) and I considered bying another only after the shutter of that camera actually stopped working. I still havent repaired it although I will most certainly do that.
So, as a replacement I searched and bought little pricier model - Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP - http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Powershot-SX10IS-Digital-Stabilized/dp/B001G5ZTZO. 
However, I also bought for my friends and relatives (as present) this particular model and tested it myself - A590IS. This model is - at least by the manufacturing quality has less quality than A80 - it is 100% plastic and looks and feel pretty cheap. But do not the first impression lead you to wrong conclusion - the A80 cost was about 600 euros in 2003, and this camera together with 8 GB card costs less than 100 euros. It draws very little energy, pictures are excellent for this price range and it is small and very compact - refined version for literally everyday usage.

I like this little bugger - strongly recommended for everyday use, unlike the SX10IS which is the best camera I have ever had but is definitely not for everyday use - it is much too bulky and complex.</Content>

<Content>This camera is a great camera for the price. The features are all easy to use and very useful. A friend of mine has a Nikon point and shoot camera that is about twice the price, but it does not have all the features that this little camera has. It is small, portable, can take high capacity SD cards which currently go up to 32 gigs. The screen is quite large and bright. The easy mode allows my six year old sister to operate it, but it has many modes that make it useful for an advanced user. The battery thing on the side allows you to get a better grip on the camera when taking pictures. This camera is definitely worth it. It might be cheap, but it has the most bang for the buck.</Content>

<Content>If you are looking for an affordable camera (in the $100-ish range) that can do a lot, then this unit may be for you.  

When our last digital camera bit the dust after a long and productive life (an earlier generation Canon) we started looking for a replacement, and were extremely pleased to find this camera.

This is what I was looking for:
1) A camera with enough megapixels to be able to produce high quality images (this one has 8MP)
2) A camera with a viewfinder.  Many cameras lack that feature, but I do much better by using a viewfinder than by using a digital display.  The reason I prefer a viewfinder is that I have continuous focus lenses in my glasses, and its tough for me to look at a digital display and simultaneously at my subject, but with a viewfinder thats not an issue.  This camera has a good viewfinder.
3)I wanted a camera with a range of features.  This one, of course, has several photo capabilities, plus video capabilities.
4) I wanted a camera that uses a standard sized battery so I can get replacement batteries wherever I go.  This camera uses two AA batteries - so no problem there.
5) I wanted a camera that uses a standard SD card to store images, and this one does.  That makes it EASY to upload images to my computer, and even to remove the SD card and plug that card directly into a digital photo frame, or into my TV which has a slot for an SD card.
6) I wanted a camera I could grip - and the shape of the camera allows that.  

All in all, this is a great camera for familys and my camera needs.

Lest you think that this camera is the end all be all of cameras, it has are a few shortcomings.  One such shortcoming is that the viewfinder does not have framing guides in it, so you have to guess at where the edges of the image will be.  When you use the viewfinder the image captured will have more space around the edges than you can see through the viewfinder, especially if you happen to wear glasses, which make it more difficult to get your eye close to the viewfinder.

All in all, though, I think that this is definitely a 5-star camera for this price range.  I dont think you will go wrong if you choose this camera for your snapshot photo needs.

Thanks Cannon!  5 stars all the way!</Content>

<Content>Never have used a digital camera before I was skeptical but I am more than happy with my Canon. Easy to use and reliable. I had a few questions and called their help number and got a friendly, helpful technician to walk me through the steps. Shipping was as they promised. I am very happy.</Content>

<Content>Bought this camera as a Christmas gift; very reasonable price and a great little camera.  Like the size and like the feel of it; can grasp it when taking a picture rather than the flat thin cameras.  I am not a professional by any means but this camera takes great pictures.  Nice view finder so you dont have to use the battery life for the screen to actually take a picture.  Definitely worth the money.</Content>

<Content>We like this camera because: easy to use, picture quality is good, compact size but not too small, great price $109 on Amazon. I wish the camera came with rechargeable batteries, but I can buy those separately. Also, it would have been nice if it came with a big SDHC card. Overall, I would definitely recommend this camera at this price!</Content>

<Content>Ive used this type of Powershot camera for my work inspecting tanks and pressure vessels for more than 10 years and the smaller, more compact, more feature-laden A590IS continues the string of great inexpensive, durable tools for taking good pictures in difficult lighting and dirty conditions.  The optical viewfinder is a big plus and the flashs power always pleasantly surprises.  AA batteries are a big convenience; essential Macro works great, and the SD card fits the reader on my HP laptop (CF cards in previous Powershots needed a separate reader).  A slightly wider angle lens is my only wish.  </Content>

<Content>Ive had nothing but a positive experience with this camera. I havent quite figured out how to use it totally yet, such as how to take lower resolution images and not use up my memory card, but the images I have taken are excellent quality. The batteries and the memory card share the same input area which makes it a bit of a pain getting the card out. I would have designed it so that the memory card could be inserted in a different more easily accessible slot. But other than that, its a great camera.</Content>

<Content>The camera takes decent shots, but what annoys me is the constant low-battery life icon that would keep popping up after about 30 shots. I used the batteries that came with the camera, and I used many different brand new batteries too. I thought that I got a defective product, so I sent it back and had it exchanged, but it gave me the same problem again. So I thought that I would just ignore the icon and still take shots, well then it wouldnt allow you to take anymore and ask you to replace the batteries. I sent this crappy camera back to Amazon and got a full refund. I am still trying to find a camera, I might get the Panasonic lumix this time, but Ill wait until Amazon gets more of those since I dont want to pay for shipping.</Content>

<Content>Im a novice digital camera user and have used this camera for 8 months, and have been extremely satisfied with it.

Not only does it take very good pictures but it also allows one to record movies at 30fps at 320*240 resolution, so I have been able to record my golf-swing with it for analysis.

The only negatives are that it eats up a lot of power quickly (be sure to have a lot of rechargeable batteries on hand) and the feature layout and controls require some getting used to. The zoom feature is also tricky to use, but that could be due to user-error on my part.

But other than that I highly recommend this camera for a first-time digital camera user.</Content>

Even the far off pics (they dont let you right up on the lions, etc.) came out with great detail. Its simple to use, small, powers up quick and takes video. I like it a lot, girlfriend loves it.

<Content>I work at a used car dealership and we post a lot of our inventory online. For a long time we used my old digital camera (a much older Canon Powershot) simply because my boss couldnt be convinced to buy a new one. After years of hard use that one finally crashed, so we had to get something new. I found this online for the price point I was looking at with more features than I had ever had before.

I really enjoy having the large LCD view screen, as that makes setting up and reviewing my shots that much easier before I upload them to our website. Its compact and uses two standard AA batteries which last a long time. This is a great camera for simple point and shoot photography. I highly recommend it. </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for my daughter who is 10 years old. The camera is sturdy, well designed and simple to use. The digital pictures are of terrific quality and the video is quite impressive. My daughter uses the camera to take pictures and videos of her friends and I help her edit and create special effects for the videos using Vegas Pro 8. 

The only thing that I wish this camera had would be a direct connect charger to keep the batteries charged.

In my opinion this is a great camera at a great price.

<Content>After much research and deliberation, I bought this camera as for daily family use. I really wanted to like it. I tried all the setting and played with the options, and even tried different memory cards.

BUT, I just couldnt get away from the rediculous delay between shots and the rediculous delay after pressing the shutter button. I did some testing and it avaraged 5-6 seconds between photos. It averaged 3-4 seconds from the time I pressed the shutter button until it took the photo.

8-10 seconds per photo is just too much when you have kids!

<Content>Performed as expected.  I especially like the battery in this camera since I do a lot of traveling and biking. I do not have to take a charger and replacements are easy to find.  The life of the battery also seems to be quite good.

The telephoto is adequate, though I would rather have a 6X-10X optical.

The range of settings are more then I need. I believe someone who needs controls for their pictures would be satisfied with this camera.

The camera is a nice size, though not as small as some, and has a firm steady feel when shooting.

Have used the video only once but it seems adequate for my use.</Content>

I wanted a camera that was priced to fit my budget and wasnt very complicated to operate as I dont have time to read about all the bells and whistles although this camera does have a lot of them! I opened the box, read the first few pages of directions, put in the batteries and memory card and I was good to go.  I clicked away for a few minutes and so far Im very happy with the results. The camera comes with cables for a printer and computer as well as software. I would suggest purchasing a case if you dont have one. The one feature I like is that I can get a good grip on it and its not super slim that I would drop it. Im good to go on my vacation and Im sure Ill have great photos when I return!</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera because Consumer Reports ranked it a best buy. It has worked as described by CR and I seem to have gotten what I expected. For a little over $100, this was an amazing deal. Its got crazy zoom power - goes up to around 10x zoom (granted the quality suffers at that power). It has several modes, like nature scenes and portrait and night scene that I tend to use. I also like that it works on AA batteries, because when they die, I can just instantly replace the batteries. It just requires me to carry batteries around with me. But at least I wont miss out on those bachelorette shots due to battery death. I dont know what Im missing out on by not buying a $250 camera, but this one has all that I need.</Content>

<Content>I got this camera for my wife for her birthday to replace her old PowerShot (which lasted about 5 years, incidentally).  Overall, were quite happy.

This cameras about the same size as her previous one, though its lighter.  I wondered about the plastic casing and whether it could withstand active use.  Already its been dropped a couple times, and it has survived.

Image quality is pretty nice at 180dpi.  Color is relatively accurate.  We havent used any of the in-camera fancy stuff (such as red-eye correction), so I cant really say much about that.

Anyone who is familiar with the PowerShot series wont be disappointed.  Its the same deal, just with 8 megapixels.  Canon seems to have taken the approach of If it aint broke, dont fix it, and its working pretty well with this camera, especially for the price.</Content>

I ended up buying an HP photo printer as well - and its fabulous. I uploaded a couple of photos I took with the camera.</Content>

<Content>This little camera is great for anyone on the go needing easy, quick pics and portability.  As a professional photographer, there are times when the large DSLR is just too much to lug around for informal snapshots or short trips via air with carry on only.  My only complaints - it has a slow recovery when shooting flash pictures and fill flash is not user friendly to activate for backlit pics.  However for the price it is hard to beat with great optics and overall ease of use.</Content>

<Content>I had purchased an A580 a year ago and I was very pleased with the pictures. I was so pleased with the A580 I purchased two of the newer model the A590IS - one for my daughter and mother or Christmas.  The pictures were great.  My mom who had not used a digital camera before took great pictures Christmas day just using the Auto (point  shoot) setting.  She was very pleased with the pictures.  I would recommend purchasing the Canon Batteries, I purchased the Canon CBK4-300 battery kit.  The batteries have a significantly better life than Energizer or Duracell rechargeable batteries.  I would also recommend a high speed SDCard. My daughter also used the movie mode which worked well in available lighting.  The camera flash doesnt have the option to turn it on during movies. So unless you purchase a video light you can only use the available light.  I purchased the Sunpak UC-VL compact video light which works independently of the camera (must be turned ON and OFF manually) but this assists in taking movies in low light.  Overall, I would highly recommend this camera.  I have also purchased an S5-IS for my personal use and because of my satisfaction with this product I felt confident to purchase Canon products again.</Content>

<Content>We purchased this camera for my nine year old as a Christmas gift.  And we have yet to be disappointed with it!  She is careful with it, but has dropped it a couple of times on a carpeted floor.  It is still working great! It only took her a couple of hours of playing with it to figure out all the settings on it and she has been able to take some amazing pictures with it.

When we purchased this camera, we didnt know it also shoots videos!  So, I do recommend getting a very large memory card for it.  Fortunately we got the 4gb memory card (Sandisk brand--cost us about $10).  500 pictures and 10 videos of varying length later and she has yet to use up the 4gb!

I highly recommend this camera to anyone who desires a great digital camera for an excellent price!

<Content>I bought this camera as gift for a family member. The person loves the camera and from the reviews I read online at such places as cnet.com this camera is a decent camera and its available at a good price (when I got it is ~$100). If you simply looking to get a camera for a family member that doesnt know all the fancy features then I suggest this camera plus it has Image Stabilization. Please look at the other reviews to get a better assessment of this camera for your own purposes.</Content>

Of course the factory presumes that the owner caused the crack due to an impact, so the repair is not covered by warranty and the repair cost is almost the same as a new camera.</Content>

<Content>I was looking for another canon camera with at least  8 meg. pix. with Image Stabilization, that uses AA batteries with the SD card. I have a larger Canon with these options but wanted a smaller version to take on vacation trips and the A590 fits the options that I was looking for, plus the price was a plus. This is my 3rd Canon and I have been very happy with all three cameras with a great deal of features included, plus excellent pictures.</Content>

<Content>this is my first and only digital camera, so not an expert review. After reading other reviews, I was concerned about being able to shoot fast enough and battery life, but neither of these have been a problem for me. the menus were easy to navigate, and I figured out how to use most of the features in about 1/2 hour. Considering the price, and the throwaway world we live in, it seems well-made. I was shocked that the included memory card(16MB?!) would only hold 10 photos,but found an 8GB card for +/-$25...</Content>

<Content>I had the previous version, the A570IS, but it mysteriously refused to download pics from the camera after only a year.
It also started to drain the batteries at an alarming rate.
I replaced it with the A590IS, which is the new version of the A570IS.
Buttons and controls are identical, except its in black instead of silver.
However, the A590IS takes much sharper, clearer pictures, and the macro mode works much better; no more blurry close ups like the A570IS.
Shot time using the flash is also dramatically improved over the A570IS.
I just hope this one lasts more than a year.</Content>

<Content>Great camera when it worked. This is my second one and the battery lid that keeps the batteies in has slightly broke and does not keep the batery firm against the metal inside to keep working.  The plastic in the battery compartment is very cheap and so is the rest of the cameras housing.  Cannon realy went cheap on this one.  Even if I hold the the battery door firm and turn on the canera , it still fails and gives me  the change batterys. 
Listen guys and girls, cannon makes better products then this.   I have owned the camear for record breaker of 4 months.  Im forced to send to canon for another replacement. Trust me when I say, dont buy this camera! Im sorry but its not worth the money.

<Content>This digital camera is inexpensive compared to other cameras and easy to use. I took a couple of shots with it and I noticed that you cant get too close to an object that you are shooting or it will not focus right. You must stand at a nice distance and use the zoom frequently. It takes some getting used to but once you get used to it, you can take some pretty good pictures. Another thing I noticed is that once you take a picture it comes out looking a bit fuzzy on the cameras display screen but once downloaded to the computer its very clear and detailed. The camera is also small and lightweight so if youre looking for something that feels a bit heavier this camera is probably not for you. Other than that its perfect for taking casual, fun pictures.   </Content>

<Content>There are dozens of reviews on this site concerning this camera and all the reviews are good. That convinced me to buy the camera. The pictures are very good and the camera is as the reviews state versatile. The Easy mode is impossible to screw-up and theres a lot of fun things to learn and do. The video on this camera has gotten a bad rap. I think the video is nearly as good as my Sony Hi8 camcorder. There is some noise on low light indoor pictures, but for a 100 dollar bill I cant imagine a better camera. My only issue is battery consumption. Buy a good rechargeable battery system with 4 batteries because youll need them. The image stabilizer really makes a difference when using the zoom. Dont buy a camera without image stabilization.

<Content>Ive had the PowerShot a590IS for only about a month now.  I didnt expect the two AA batteries or the SD card that came with it to be anything spectacular.  They werent.  Replaced the card with a 1gb eFilm PRO SD card and solved that problem.  But the batteries -- After the supplied batteries quickly died, I replaced them with a pair of 2300 mAh Lenmar rechargables - fully charged.  I expected to be off and running with a reasonable amount of battery life on hand.  Not so.  That wretched little, red low battery flashing icon came on in less than two hours of non-constant camera use.  Two additional, freshly charged, batteries had the same result.  Im thinking this may be partially my fault as I did use the LED screen and flash about half that time.  But I really do think I should have gotten more use from these batteries.  So, I have purchased a pack of four Sanyo NiMH, Eneloop batteries and await their arrival.  I did a lot of research on which batteries to purchase and try, and these seem to come out on top. It is claimed these particular batteries dont leak juice, just sitting there, the way others will. I have a Nikon dSLR and a Canon SD870IS and Im just not used to low battery life.  I wish this a590IS had the same type of battery thats in the 870. Perhaps I see the need to change the approach I have of tending to battery life with my use of the a590 camera.  Ive shut the LED off (on the 590) except for a few seconds of post-view after a shot.  I have to use the LED to compose with the 870IS, but wont with the a590.  I also find that the 590 gives me a softer print than the 870, but I can live with this.  I really only want the a590 as a camera that can travel with me that I dont have to worry about.  But, it would be nice to get some mileage out of it if Im along the coast of Maine, or some such place for the day where it would get a good amount of use.  I do really like this a590IS, but give it only three stars because I have no confidence in its ability to last a reasonable amount of time.  It hasnt done that yet.  Perhaps the new batteries and my new approach (which I dont really think I should have to take) will make a difference here.  Ill edit this whole thing if thats my experience after a reasonable amount of time.  Maybe I should have gotten the updated Canon SD880IS and use 870IS as my travel companion. That would have been a great idea, but the 870IS is too expensive for the casual attitude I could have with the a590.  Again, I do like the a590, but it does chew up the batteries - at least for me.  I hope that changes.  If it does, Ill report that.  Until then. . . .

Well, Its been almost two months since the above post.  A very helpful person replied and suggested a stronger battery - but, please read on: The four Sanyo Eneloop batteries arrived and I purchased four 8X Energizer Lithium batteries (+/- $11 for either 4 pack).  I took two of the Eneloops right out of the pack and put them in the camera.  Its well over 200 shots later now and the Eneloops appear to be still going strong.  I have become a believer in the Eneloops and now have the confidence in the A590IS that caused me to give the camera only three stars earlier.  I have two of the 8X Energizer lithium batteries in the camera case for when the Eneloops need to be replaced, only to be recharged.  The 8X Energizers are not rechargable.  I have since purchased four additional Eneloops along with the charger for these batteries.  Around $15, on sale, at Amazon.  The Eneloops (and, possibly the Energizers) will eventually replace, and become my only AA battery.  The Sanyo Eneloop batteries are only 2000 mAh, but they dont loose their charge the way other rechargables will while just sitting there.  I dont seem to need anything more than this 2000 mAh rateing.  If I could change the star rate of the A590IS, it would be to four stars.  Not five because I would like to see a wider field of view at that end, and I do find that sunlight in back of me does diminish the LED effectivness - but the optical viewfinder is there for those occasions.  I suppose the camera would be more expensive if it overcame these two points. So, it was the batteries all along.  Sanyo Eneloops solved this and I expect the 8X Energizer lithiums will be good also.  I would report on the Energizers, but the Sanyo product doesnt seem to want to give up so I can try the lithiums.  Just a moment to say that I keep the camera on aperature priority or progrm so I can keep the ISO at 200 (manually set), or below.  Others have complained about noise, but I havent seen any at these ISO settings.  Its good to have the confidence, now, in this nice little camera.     </Content>

<DocID>B0011ZCDKS-185</DocID>
<Content>I got this camera to replace my Canon Powershot A520 4.0MP ps camera since Im due with our 2nd baby in less than 2 weeks. It was so cheap I couldnt resist (only $109). I like being able to take short video clips and wanted the higher MPs for photos and needed something small for days when I dont want to lug my DSLR + lens around along with my diaper bag. I think itll do the job well. Some things I dislike though: 1) The camera is slow on rechargeable batteries unless the batteries are fully charged. Noticeably slower than with the A520. 2) Also powering on/off is noisy due to mechanical noise associated the lens opening/retracting (this is audible and unpreventable even with all volume/sounds turned off except for playback  the self timer). Much more audible than our Powershot A520 and I would be nervous using it in a quiet setting like a wedding or funeral.

My major gripe is with the new Zoombrowser 6.1 software that came with the A590IS. The A590IS wont work with the older Zoombrowser SW I have (version 5.0), images show up as question marks and do not download at all. I did not have any problems removing my old SW as a previous reviewer mentioned--my Dell laptop running Windows XP actually automatically removed the old version and installed the new version when I loaded the CD-ROM that came with the new camera.

The most annoying feature of Zoombrowser 6.1 is that it automatically connects you to the CameraWindowDC interface that has no instructions and just a bunch of buttons to click on if you plug the camera in using the USB cable to download images. I cant find a way to bypass this interface and still connect to the camera. This method of connecting takes away the option to set the individual image file names and download folder name automatically as was possible with the Zoombrowser 5.0 version--I like to use the shooting date + a 4 position sequence number and I like give folder names that reflect the event/occasion, not simply the shooting date. 

So now there are many extra steps to rename the files and move them into an appropriate folder. However, the features to set the file names and download folder are available if you use ZoomBrowser 6.0 to connect to a memory card (like when I download images from my DSLR using a USB-based multi-memory card reader). In Zoombrowser 5.0, you had the option whether you were connecting directly to the camera or a card reader or directly to a memory card.

So now the best way for me to download the images from the A590IS while maximizing the utility of Zoombrowser 6.0 is for me to take the SD card out of the camera and put it into the built-in SD card reader in my laptop. Then I have the option to select a specific download folder  set the way I want the images named as they download.</Content>

It takes great pictures and video
The menue is user friendly
BUT...........................................
The camera worked fine for the 3 weeks he was abroad. he took some great pictures. After he was home for 1.5 weeks the censor stopped working, just 2 days past Amazons return policy aloud for returns. Now I have to deal with Canons repair center which is a huge hastle. I feel like if the product was only used for 3 weeks that we should get a new camera as a replacement not a repaired defective camera. Make sure you use the heck out of your camera the first few weeks to be sure if something goes wrong you can return it to Amazon and not have to go to Canon.</Content>

Now, I dont have any great aspirations of being any sort of photographer -- I bought the camera to take pictures of my work to share for progress photos on a project -- still, I find myself taking photos of other things as well.  Before, taking a photo was amongst the list of last things I would do! 

All I can say is BRAVO!! great price - great product - worth MORE than what you pay!!!</Content>

<Content>Good easy to use camera with large LCD screen. One user review said it did not work with rechargeable batteries, well, I didnt have any problem using the rechargeable batteries. This camera did not work with previous Canon software I had in my PC (for A520 and EOS 10D), and it was a lot of trouble to replace software, which I did not succeed. But, take SD card out of this A590 and insert it in A520, I was able to download the A590 images to PC via A520( I dont know if this causing degraded resolution or not). Otherwise, A590 is a good value, especially if you dont have to fiddle with your software. </Content>

<Content>The cameras features are more abundant and much easier to figure out than with the 4 year old 3MP Olympus I was using.   Have not even looked at the manual.  I wish Canon had put on a larger flash as the light drops off in the picture at about 10-12 feet.  But taking pictures outside with sun that is not an issue. I have taken about 400 pics using the flash set to auto still using the original set of batteries (copper tops).  Camera has shutter priority and aperature priority, features usually found on more expensive equipment.  I am happy with my purchase as the the lens fully retracts into the body and covers itself and am able to carry it in my jeans pants pocket for easy portability.  For the money you cant beat this camera. </Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera based on the mostly exceptional reviews on many sites. However, after using it one time and downloading the pictures to my computer the aperture priority (Av) and manual (M) modes would not function. I could not power on the camera in either mode. If I was in a different mode and turned the function dial to either Av or M, the camera would shut off. Since I had the camera for over 3 weeks, I got an RMA from Canon and sent camera back. Received a camera back with same problem and different serial number. What followed was a lot of grief arguing with Canon customer care. Fortunately, Adorama/Amazon stood by the product and gave me a full refund.</Content>

We will not use all of the 8MP. It is not necessary to get the quality of pictures that we desire. The only time we might set it up high is to take pictures at a distance and then crop them down. It is well worth the money we paid for it. $104</Content>

This Canon is easy to use, has a much fast reaction time between shots, and great picture quality. Ive used the video function on it, and my husband asked if I had use our video camera! I dont know why people think its so loud...I just turned off the volume, and therefor makes no noise. I love that it is easy turn the flash on and off. This little camera, is easily worth the money, and whats not to love when it performs well, and comes with such a sweet price tag? </Content>

<Content>  I owned two other Canon Power Shot cameras: the original A30 (3 MP), and the 530(5MP). I was most satisfied with both.  I bought the 590IS  for its image stabilization feature and the fact that it was 8 MP. I am disappointed.  I have had more blurred pictures with this camera in three weeks than I had in the entire period of my ownership of the other two cameras.  The viewfinder, a good feature not available in many new point-and-shoot cameras, is unreliable in terms of coverage; I never had this issue in either of the earlier Canon iterations.  The color is spotty. The battery life is terrible.  The motion pictures, at higher resolutions, are only 20 fps, rather than 30 in the older camras.  This camera has all the bells and whistles, and appears to be a wonderful value for the money, but performance has been a disappointment. I prefer my three year old A 530 Power Shot.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera about a month ago, so Ive had a little time to use it and found it to be a great camera.  Its a good mix of being both a simple point-and-shoot camera or allowing great control in manual modes for special effect pictures.  I dont consider myself to be a good photographer, yet the pictures I get with this camera are great.  Ive had a couple of digital cameras, but this one blows them away.  Several features I like are that it uses SD or the newer SDHC cards, standard or NmHI AA batteries, has an optical viewfinder (great for us over 40 people).  While it comes with a good deal of documentation, using this camera without reading too much of that is easy.  The onscreen menus are easy to navigate.  To be honest, I cant think of a bad thing to say about this camera.  Well, one thing is they give you a 32 meg SD card with it, which is pretty useless as an 8 mega pixel super fine picture will consume close to 4 megabytes of memory...  Personally I would recommend at least a 512 meg card, also, get good NmHI rechargeable batteries and charger.  </Content>

<Content> I purchased this camera while on vacation.  After returning home and viewing the pictures, I realized that none of them had a sharp image quality.  I began to experiment with many settings and with many options.  Some pictures were better than others but everyone has less definition and less crispness to the images than my old HP 2 megapixel camera.  

All of the pictures, if viewed at 100% of their size, had blurred or softened edges on picture frames, edges of houses, lamp shades, etc.  The smaller I made the picture, the less noticeable it became but it still was not clear.  I dont know if this is what is referred to as noise but I do not want to have to adjust the sharpness of every picture I take with editing software.  

Based on so many good reviews, I began to think that I must have gotten a defective camera and returned it to the chain store in my home location.  I purchased another A590IS from Amazon.  In the mean time, I read all the instructions for the different settings so that I would understand how to use it.  I did not want the poorness of pictures to be operator error.  

When the new camera arrived,  I took comparison pictures.  I had the same results. The colors are good but the sharpness is not there.  I took identical shots with my old HP and with the new Canon.  The Canon has good color and the pictures are larger but the definition and quality of the image is just not there.</Content>

But it looks really cheap, and whenever I use it I cant help feeling like I bought it at the 99-cents store and its going to fall apart in my hands. It doesnt fall apart, fortunately, but if I had seen the real thing before I bought it, rather than just an image on the web, I would have passed it by. Id rather have a camera that both works well and looks and feels solid.</Content>

They are tough little cameras that take lovely pictures. They can be adjusted a bit if you are into that and the video function as been huge entertainment. Compact enough for cargo pockets and purses, big enough to hold on to. A little zoom lens and a built in flash make it versitile. Uses rechargable AAs and a common memory card (SD) making it practical. All in an affordable package. It is not a DSLR, but it will be there and be able to get a nice shot.</Content>

<Content>I love this camera. I do astrophotography, and this camera is the best low light digital Ive seen so far. I have a Kodak EasyShare C653, and it too is a great camera for the daytime shots but this Canon really out does it in low light conditions. It has the manual features of a more 
expensive camera, for half the price. Youll find it extremely hard to beat, or even match this cameras features for the price... and oh by the way... I found the best price here. 

This camera rocks, I can stand outside my back door and point it at a constellation, or group of stars and point and click... and the shot is mine. I couldnt believe how easily it took shots of the stars. Thanks Canon... nice job!

<Content>I absolutely love my new camera!  It is more beautiful in hand, than in the photos, which was a plus for me because it is more silver looking than black, which was what I really wanted.  The colors are incredible, which was not a surprise as I really searched for a camera with high resolution photos.  Too good, as it does tend to make something not clean look gorgeous!  Easy to handle, use, transfer photos to computer (dont need to buy anything more, just need a USB port on your computer).  Need a decent 4GB SDHC memory card (try San Disk on Amazon for $4); one is included but very small memory, batteries also included, and dont even think to get a recharger (not necessary). Price is unbeatable for the value!  Snatch this up, you wont be sorry!</Content>

<Content>I purchased this Camera through Amazon for my 11 year old son a month ago.  
The lighting on the LCD screen is great for both pictures and video.  The camera can take up to a maximum 4MB SD Card which is fine for my son to make short videos and edit them on a computer. Its also nice having the option of using the LCD screen or the old school view finder to take the picture.  I would have given this a 5 star rating if the outer casing was made of metal instead of plastic.  I hope it will hold up for an 11 year old boy. 
All in all my son and I are both very happy with it and it is very easy for him to use and thumb his way through the internal software.</Content>

<Content>Besides being a great point and shoot camera, the A590IS allows manual control for difficult situations or creative photography.

I wanted a camera that could be used for digitizing my old prints and 35mm transparencies. I fully expected to pay hundreds more for the features I needed and am amazed that a camera with this functionality can be bought for slightly over a hundred dollars.

It enables manual control of aperature, shutter speed and focus in addition to macro mode for focusing down to 2 inches. Macro mode in combination with optical zoom allows focusing down to 12 inches and a reduction of barrel distortion.

There are so many features and shooting modes a brief review cannot begin to cover them. I suggest a potential buyer do as I did and examine the 200 page user guide available in .pdf format on the Canon website.</Content>

<Content>I would rate this camera only as average at this time because of the battery problems outlined below. Have not used the camera enough to rate the quality of the photos, features, and general operation at this time. Also, the included SD card with the camera was a measly 32 MB, basically nothing in this day and age of large image files and cheap memory. To get decent photos capacity and a spare, I bought two on-sale Kingston 2 GB SD cards, one from Meritline.com for ca. $7 (free shipping) and one locally at Inkspot for ca.  $5.

My advice to others is that if you suspect your camera has a problem not due to your use/handling and the camera is still under warranty; return it ASAP to Canon for repairs.

I bought camera early last December as a Christmas present, from Amazon since it seem to have the best price at the time including free shipping. Selected this camera model based on Consumer Reports recommendation, mostly favorable user reviews on Amazon and some ther websites, and the camera price and features. I was a bit concerned about some reviewers complaining of low battery life, but thought perhaps they were a small minority, maybe their problems were due to the way some used thier cameras/settings, and theres always a few lemons sold in any product line. 

2. The camera out of the box seemed to be functional for all the features I tested, but after playing with the camera to learn how to use it, and a few dozen shots, the low battery inidcation came on. after a few number more shots (est. a few dozen), the battery replace indication came on and the camera shut down. These were the Panasonic alkaline AA batteries that came with the camera. At this time my voltmeter measured the batteries at ca. 1.35v. 

3. To reduce power use, changed some settings to turn LCD off after a short time, and the IS (Image Stabilization) from always on to on only during shots. Put in new Berkley  Jensen (BJs) alkalines, same low battery indication after a few dozen shots. After about a dozen more shots, the replace battery indication came on and the camera shut down. After checking the battery contacts, letting the camera sit for a while, etc., no change in behavior, i.e. camera can be turned on for a few shots with low battery indication on, then change battery indication comes on and camera shut down. The BJs batteries voltage was 1.45v at this time.

4.  A friendly camera repair place person told me about the Canon website online repair setup and gave me an Internet address, but even then it was not easy to find page, the website search did not find it for me. Go to any consumer camera model support; look at the bottom part of the page for links to Repair Request or Repair  Tracking. Gee, I wonder why Canon doesnt make it obvious, could it be that they really dont want to hear from us, especially for warranty stuff... ?!?!

https://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=OnlineRepairBookingActfcategoryid=221modelid=15658

http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=OnlineTrackSearchAct

So I decided to return camera to Canon for warranty repair (no cost except my shipping camera to them). I mailed the camera (included 2 sets of batteries I used) to Canons Elk Grove Village, IL facility by US Mail, insured and with post office deliver confirmation. Canon received it in a few days, confirmed receipt to me via E-mail, and I received it and my batteries back by FedEx ca. 3 days later. Factory documentation returned with the camera noted that:

- Low batteries was cause of problems, said nothing about any adjustments (Unit has battery shortage. Check all functions, repair to good working order.), but since the camera behaves differently after getting it back, I suspect they adjusted both the battery low and the battery replace indicators voltage threshold settings even though nothing was said about it.
- ...found the optical assembly was inoperative and the focus did not operate properly. Adjustments were carried out on the optical assembly. I did not notice any wildly out of focus photos by the out-of-the-box camera using the Auto focus mode; perhaps theyre addressing the manual focus mode that I did not test.


5. After I received the camera back from Canon, I put in the original used Panasonic and BJs akalines (approx. 1.35v and 1.45v, respectively, similar to as previously measured), and still got the low battery indication with both sets. 

6. Decided to put in a new set of BJs alkalines, measured at ca. 1.59V. Camera set for AUTO mode, IS on only during shots, face detection on. Occasionally used the zoom feature, once or twice for every 25 set of shots.
	- After 100 shots in succession, most with flash used, battery voltage checked to be ca. 1.43v.
	- After 32 more shots, low battery indication came on, did 12 more shots, turned camera off, batteries checked at ca. 1.35v
	- When camera turned back on, low battery indication not on, but came on again after 5 shots. When got up to 191 shots total, camera to off, batteries checked to be ca. 1.38v.
	- Turn camera back on, low battery indication on again after 13 shots, camera off, checked batteries at ca. 1.34v.
	- At 204 total shots with the set of new BJs alkalines, the battery replace indication came on, and the camera shut down shortly after. Can turn on camera again of 2-3 shots before the replace indication/shutdown occurs again. The number of shots here appears to match the camera manual specification page that list ca. 200 shots for akaline batteries.

7. For the second set of testing, I used a fully charged set of Ultra Pro NiMH 2500 mAH-rated AA batteries (ca. 1.43v - 1.45v measured). Made all shots indoors, those where flash used were of house interior, those without flash used was through window (daylight).
	- Erased all the previous 217 images from the SD card.
	- After 150 shots, half with flash, half without, no low battery indication, turned camera off for ca. 45 min. for lunch.
	- When camera turned back on, low battery indication showed, camera off, checked batteries at ca. 1.33v.
	- When camera turned on, no low battery indication showed, but indication showed again after 23 shots using flash, continued to 25 shots using flash.
	- Continued shooting 25 shots at a time alternating between flash and no flash, for 175 more shots. After a total of 350 shots (half with flash) have been taken with the NiMH batteries, batteries measured ca 1.27 - 1.29v.
	- Continued shooting 25 shots at a time alternating between flash and no flash, for 150 more shots. After a total of 500 shots (half with flash) have been taken with the NiMH batteries, batteries measured ca 1.26 - 1.27v now. At this point, I gave up test shooting, as I have not seen the battery replacement indication after 500 shots. The number of shots here appears to in line with the camera manual specification page that list approx. 450 images for NiMH batteries. Fooled around for few more test photos, and the battery replace indication/camera shutdown occurred after ca. dozen flash shots past 500. 

8. Some observations about the camera:
	- It looks like Ill have to accept the low battery indication on most of the time. My guess is that there some kind of design and/or manufacturing defect where the camera electronics/software does not accurately detect how much of the battery capacity is remaining. Judging from the various user reviews, it may not be present in all sold units of this model, as not everyone sees this problem. However, if the camera can perform OK for several hundred shots until the battery replacement indication/shutdown (esp. with NiMH which I want to use), I can live with that. 
	- The flash can take more than 5 sec. to recover for the next flash shot.
	- The camera seems to work differently on alkalines vs. NiMH 2500 mAH-rated rechargables, as it continues working at lower voltage for rechargables. I know that the discharge curves, and capacity and voltage ratings for the alkalines and NiMH batteries are different, the alkaline are rated at 1.5v (actual ca. 1.6v new), and rated capacities numbers can be similar to the NiMH (over 2500 mAH). The NiMH batteries are rated at 1.2v (actual ca. 1.4v new), capacities can be vary (typ.1000-2800 mAH). The initial voltage of both battery types drops fairly quickly from their nominal ratings during use  but after the initial drop, the NiMH types tend to have a flatter voltage vs. use time curves than the alkalines. 
	- Since battery monitors typically can only see voltage as an indirect measure of capacity remaining, why should the camera decide that the lower NiMH battery voltage is still OK, while a higher voltage on the alkalines is not? If the alkalines and NiMH rated capacities can be simialr, why dont they perform similarly, or are the alkaline capacity ratings done differently than the NIMH? Canons camera documentation implies the camera treats the battery types differently as it explicitly notes the performance difference in their camera spec. for nominal number of shots for alkalines vs. NiMH batteries. My Internet research also seems to indicate that the battery rating numbers may or may not all be done via a standard method, and different manufacturers batteries can perform significantly differently under the same conditions, so as to make the capacity ratings less than useful.

<Summary>Canon A590IS - Possibly Good Camera With Some Flaws</Summary>
</Review>
<Review>
<DocID>B0011ZCDKS-247</DocID>
<Content>Never thought id be so happy having this camera. With $100 tag, i was never expect this such of quality, features and ability. I was actually waiting for my decision whether getting G10, LX3, or SD990 (more compact) .. all of those has manuals to control. Then i heard that Fuji has new sensor coming, and so the waiting process extended (cos i need camera good for concert : low light, and im curious of what fuji would bring to the table this time). I know that im not gonna make any decision in this few months and so i purchased this hundred bucks camera cos it has manuals.

And i was very happy i bought this one as a tweener as i need to have smaller camera at the moment (i have sony dsc-h5 which i love so much but cannot slip to my pocket), and believe it or not it fits my skinny jeans pocket, just need a little extra slip then its good (though it will make a little bump on your pocket more than smaller compact, but still fits comfortably as long as you dont sit with it inside your pocket).

The manual control is amazing in this camera. You can control aperture shutter, exposure, flash level (i love this one!), and manual focus (and this one also). Amazingly, the pics i took with this camera looks really great .. not great great but .. REALLY GREAT! Ive had SD1000 before and the pics looked horrible! Noise and unacceptable noise in every inch of the pictures when i crop it 100%, grainy and it doesnt have ability of taking pic indoor (at least thats my experience .. on lots of occasions, enough for me to give conclusion that its more like a toy, anyway i loved the shape a lot!).

Never liked the shape of A series until now, it feels more secure in my hand, and its not as big as i was expected (in a good way), i still consider it small (look at G9 or A650, now thats big! .. for pocket) and some people complains about battery life, i dont have that problem since i charge my eneloop batteries right.

Cos :
- Constructions, plastic all around. I bet thats why canon made this very affordable, yet the quality of the camera exceeds other compacts in its class (our advantage in my opinion, to fight the price), though id prefer rugged material for me i have no problem, since i found the plastic body is quite cute and pretty as long as you dont let it fall. Not a problem.

- Video quality is to be honest .. ugly (20fps)! Mic is pretty good except the picture .. even only play it on my computer. Then when i plug it to my hdtv and tube tv .. DISASTER! dont expect any quality video out of this camera. But since im not into video anyway so .. Not a problem

- Slow flash recycle when you set it on full/strongest level. But im using manual setting, and set the flash output to the lowest most of the time, so the recycle time is not that slow (about 2 or 3 seconds total after each snaps, and remember .. that after each snap we will have a preview of what we just took, so for me, i didnt feel like i was waiting). But if youre into action picture with flash, dont complain .. just dont buy this camera cos this camera is fully loaded for its price! I see the reason people had a it very very slow because most of them are using Auto mode, which is using the max flash output most of the time, causing the flash recycle to be very slow, i mean REALLY SLOW like about 10 seconds total including preview. While the medium takes about 5 seconds total (hey i just counted it by my sense, didnt do the exact timing with stop watch, sorry if im not that accurate, thats why i typed : ..about)

- Auto mode is horrible! get ready to be washed out by the flash and very often set to high ISO automatically. But i found out that the easy mode works way better for this purpose. So take easy mode instead i you need to take a quick snap.

- I wish this one has the famous canons color accent, but its doesnt !
Now this one is a problem for me cos i loved it, shoot! 

- LCD resolution is a little low. Not that good. Its become a problem for me sometimes since i use manual focus very often, so its a bit difficult to see whether its focused or not cos the pic on LCD isnt sharp and that clear (doesnt affect the result at all if you got it right, its just the LCD). A little bugger on this one.

Well overall i am very very happy to have this camera. Heck ! for 100 bucks i buried all the cons far away of my thoughts cos the pros outweighs everything. Glad i didnt get other budget class camera, cos though its the same price range (under $200) its gonna be lower class instead of this one. 

Oh yeah, ive always put something in front of the flash as a diffuser so i dont have a harsh flash light (but this camera has great flash anyway, youll be okay without anything, just set the level and watch for the distance) i even stick the toilet paper (this one was the best) on the clear tape and stick it on the flash. But now i have a better and dedicated flash diffuser for point and shoot camera that spreads out the light evenly and  nicely without giving a harsh spot flash light causing the washed out picture. Especially for portrait pics. I have attached some pictures of it, so check it out!

Now i can see whats the hype about canons. But as long as you able to control your camera of what it could brings to the picture and not the other way around, any camera with a decent quality would be fine. Depends on what your needs, any brands has their good and bad ones (i love my SONY DSC-H5, but i hate my nikon P5100s pic quality). Dont let biased people become a judge to your decision.

Give this cute little camera a chance, i bet youre gonna love of what you spend! Good luck!</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera for my classroom to take pictures of my students and their activities.  The camera is easy to use, takes great pictures.  The delay between pictures can be a little frustrating, but I have learned to adapt to the delay.  Picture review is simple and straightforward. There are many features on this camera, which requires reading of the manual (not my strength).  However, reading the manual will let you use this camera to its fullest potential.  If you dont read the manual, it is a game of trial and error to find the right setting.  I like the feature of AA batteries, easier to carry extras.  The location for the memory card is easily accessible as well.  Overall, great first digital camera.  Takes quality pictures and the Cannon name and reputation are obvious.</Content>

<Content>I own two of these A590IS cameras and three A570ISs.  I shoot 3D images by using two of these at a time.  The A590IS has an optically stabliized image that is very useful in low light or when the camera is zoomed in at 4X.  The display is sufficient to preview the composition in full sunlight, but the optical viewfinder is also a fine feature to have.

Rechargable AA battereis last about 200 shots or more and the display may be turned off to increase this.  However the display does not seem to draw so much power that this is worth doing.  The AA battereis make this camera larger than some other Canons, but I prefer the AAs due to their general availabity when on vacation.  One set of lithium batteries may be used to fill an 8gig card without replacement.

The graphite fiber plastic body is more robust than the metal body used in the A570ISs that I also have that tends to show dents from heavy use.

The only feature that could be improved upon with this camera is the focal length of the zoom lens.  I would also recommed the SX110 that I purchased for its 10x zoom lens.

The video fuction of this camera is also great, and better than video cameras in that it isa full 640x480 at 30 frames per second.  Normal video cameras are not as good for viewing on the computer due to interlacing that prevents fozen images from being sharp.

The Canon A590IS is a very good value.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera because I wanted a small digital that would allow me to take great photos without requiring a loan to buy the camera. I have had had a 2000 35mm Cannon EOS which has been an excellent camera but I wanted something more compact which would allow me to have a camera available without lugging around a heavy, large case.  The PowerShot A590IS has been the perfect choice for my needs. I took it out for the first time last week to really take some photos and I got many beautiful shots of my niece at sunset. I havent had the chance to get really creative with it, right now Im just trying to learn the basics of the camera and that has been an easy and enjoyable task.</Content>

<Content>a href=http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LQ21KTB279PAWatch Video Here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LQ21KTB279PA/a Ive been using this camera for about a month now, and purchased it primarily out of concern for picture quality. The feel, controls and options are convenient, and the more complicated menu options can be learned in a relaxing 20 minutes of tinkering; or not - because the Auto features are very adequate.

It does devour batteries, but that is typical of bright display digital cameras.  Batteries, however, provide the convenience of no charger, or problematic chargers.  One set of batters will last for hundreds of pictures and multiple videos.

The pictures are excellent, and the video is of higher quality than my hard drive camcorder.  The attached video is of a tearless protest over toy control.</Content>

<Content>A great camera for a great price. I love the clear pictures it takes, good color, and the IS feature really gives a sharp image when you dont expect it! Also, the battery life seems to be fine...I am still using the two AA batteries that came with the camera - i was worried by other reviews that I would have to be constantly changing/charging them. The cons of the camera are that it is plastic, and therefore feels a little more fragile and cheaper than the previous Canon I owned. The moving parts/buttons seem a bit flimsy. Also, as noted in other reviews, the lens going in and out is noisy. But overall, I feel I have a great camera for the price I paid!</Content>

<Content>The only thing I dont like about this camera is the users manual which is too small with tiny print and tiny Black  White illustrations. 

The learning curve here is challenging with this hindrance. I want to use features I am used to in non-digital cameras, i.e. control over aperature settings and shutter speed, easy zooming, etc but to do so in a digital there is a lot to learn and this cameras documentation does not make it easy.

I like the feel of the camera in my hand. Because I am far-sighted, I needed the viewfinder in addition to the digital viewer so I am happy to have that. The images I have shot have been steady and nicely exposed even on the Auto setting.

I am still learning but so far I am happy with the camera.</Content>

<Content>I had a Kodak 330 and this Canon Powershot A590 IS is hands above that old camera. The camera actually focuses on your subject and takes ultra clear, gorgeous pictures. It has a nice place to hold it, so it feels secure in your hand. Lots and lots of features to take pictures, more than Ill ever use. Great options to go completely manual and a combination of manual/automatic. Ive used the snow scene option quite a lot and the pictures come out great. 

One drawback is there is no internal memory, so you have to have a memory card; which is stored in the same space as the battery. Not a big deal for me, but some complained about it. I purchased a 4GB card, as you do have the option to take large picture files.

Compared to the Kodak this camera feels more sturdy and better construction. Some complained of a flimsy feeling construction, but I dont find that. This camera also has the option of interchangeable lenses, but you first need to buy an adapter and then the lens. I probably wont do that as that will cost even more than the camera!

Some complained about short battery life. It doesnt seem much different from the Kodak I had and I just replaced the batteries from the original after having it for a month. Now I am using rechargeable batteries.

The cycle delay with flash photos is longer than I would want, but that is a minor inconvenience compared to all the great features and awesome pictures I get. 

I definitely would recommend this camera. Its great for someone who dapples in photography and wants some manual options as well as for the casual user who will only use the auto options.</Content>

Faces and background.. perfect.  I took some shots of the sun setting, even to my eye it seemed so very far away, but it came out so great.  I seen some ppl thought it was chunky or heavy, Not so at least not to me.  All and all.. great camera, btw.. cant beat the price or dealing with Amazon.  Not the first time I bought from Amazon and wont be the last.  At least I know of one store I wont be disappointed with.</Content>

<Content>This was a Christmas present for a 75 year-old Grandma...one who, up to this point, bought only disposable cameras.  After a 10 minute lesson on uses and the basic mechanics, she is now a photo fiend - pictures of every moment and every event since the gift was given.  The ease of use plays biggest into the equation, there really wasnt a learning curve (though the explanation of the SD card got a little murky).  Nonetheless, CVS develops them for her and they erase the old ones; she is set after each shoot - she loves it.  Color and accuracy of the images is more than passable, down-right nice!</Content>

Went to use it 4 days later and it wouldnt turn on..Replaced the batteries with 4 other sets,new  newly charged..Nothing. Went through and wiped everything down  per the manual and still nothing so needless to say I am mailing it back for a refund. Severly aggravated to say the least. I think I might re-order but not sure. All the other reviews seemed good on it Which is how I usually decide whether to buy something or not. Im sure its just a fluke.</Content>

<Content>Im a late convert to the digital age over film, but this camera makes me wonder why I waited. It takes phenomenal photos, and is easy to use. 999 photos (with a larger media card than provided). How much would that equivalent in film cost? And then add in the cost of developing, and youve already paid for this camera. I have a media card device so I just pop the media card out of the camera and download directly. SO cool! Then import the photos into any type of photo-shopping program, crop it (if need be) and print. Your PC is your darkroom! In 8 mega-pixel glory, no less. And you cannot beat the price. I highly recommend this camera to the novice and the pro who wants a lightweight camera to carry around with them. </Content>

I am a retired professional commercial photographer who has always been an advocate for Canon brand cameras. I bought one (at a higher price) for my granddaughter, decided it was a super buy, and bought one for myself from Amazon.
This camera is actually an equal quality wise to the DSLR Canon I have except for the lack of additional interchangeable lenses, which are not an expected advantage for point and shoot cameras. The range of available features cannot be equaled anywhere near this fantastic price.</Content>

<Content>This is a great camera for the casual photographer or as a walk-around camera.  It takes sharp photos, helped by image stabilization, and is easy to use.  An added benefit for the casual user is that it takes AA batteries, eliminating the problem of picking up the camera only to find the proprietary battery needs charging.  What really makes this camera stand out is the price.  Just a few years ago a camera of this quality would have cost three or four hundred dollars and now its just over one hundred.</Content>

<Content>I bought my Canon PowerShot A590 IS about six months ago and Im very happy with the purchase.  My main use for the camera was to take pictures of faces, groups of people, places, and business images for posting on my website www.iq2.biz.  Example pictures would be office buildings, conference rooms with chairs, people working at laptops etc.   This camera is so easy to use and has so many features that I dont think I can include all of them here so Ill focus on only my top favorites.

AA Battery Power
#1  favorite feature of the Canon PowerShot A590 is that it uses AA batteries.   What that means is that I (or you) dont have to stop and plug the camera into a wall outlet and wait for the battery to recharge.  No, I can simply carry a few extra AA batteries in my camera case and if I find myself taking 200 or more pictures in one afternoon, I can just replace the batteries and continue taking pictures.  The camera warns you of a low battery power situation with an indicator located on the display.  If you dont want to keep buying AA batteries, you can use rechargeable AA batteries and keep an extra, fully charged set of those batteries in your camera bag, handbag, or backpack.

Large 2.5 inch LCD Screen
#2 favorite feature is the large 2.5-inch LCD screen with face detection technology and red eye correction.  The display is very big.  You can easily see what you want to photograph without having to squint your eyes.  The image is clear and bright.   If you are taking a picture of a persons face, you can clearly see whether or not the person is ready and the picture will be good or if you have to give him/her some coaching to get a good facial expression.  (eyes open, etc)    You can make the camera focus on a certain face in a group or an object by pressing the picture button down only half way and looking in the display.  You will see a square appear around the face/object and if thats what you want the camera to focus on then you press the button down all the way to snap the picture. The camera has three options to fix red-eye but as of yet, I have not had any pictures which came out with a red-eye issue.  

No Blurry Pictures
#3 favorite feature is the 4x optical image stabilized zoom.    What this means is the camera has a technology that will keep your pictures from coming out blurry even if you move your hands a little or your subject moves a little bit.  So far, I have not had any pictures with a blurry image.

Easy Downloading and Printing
#4 favorite feature and maybe the best.  Easy printing - this camera features a Print/Share button for easy direct printing to a printer or downloading to your computer. 

So to download your pictures from the camera to your computer or laptop, just connect the USB cable to your camera and connect the other end to your computers USB connection (any of them). Once its connected and your camera is ON and in the picture review mode, whatever picture software you have installed on your computer will open automatically.  Next, youll select the menu choice to download the pictures to your computer.  (I use Adobe software for digital photos.)  When the pictures are downloaded to your picture directory, youll see a new folder added with the current date.   You can delete the pictures from your Canon camera after theyve finished downloading by either choosing the delete menu option in your picture software program or by using the menu button on the back of the camera itself.  The menu button is easy to see on the back of the camera and is the starting point for pretty much any feature you are interested in using.   Just press the menu button and then use the func set button to scroll down the menu list which youll see on the LCD display.
    
To sum up my thoughts about the Canon PowerShot A590 IS camera, I would have to say its very easy to use, takes great pictures, and is very inexpensive.  I highly recommend this camera.

Ive only had it for a few days and already I am very pleased with the purchase.  Lots of features, great picture quality with outdoor and indoor shots.   

The AS 590 IS cost me about a third of the price of the hunk-o-junk Olympus Stylus 820, but the quality of the photos Ive taken is far superior.  

Im still experimenting with it. My husband, whos a bit of a photography buff, was pleasantly surprised at the features and the photo quality!

<Content>This is a great camera for those who arent looking for a camera to take action pictures in low light.I only say that as the flash takes so long to get ready you might miss your next shot. Picture quality is great!You couldnt ask for better pictures.I personally love this cammera so far, but then Ive only had it for a month so I might find other things I dont like. Oh and as with all digital cameras, use rechargeable batteries as this one goes through them like all the rest.I think that for an everyday shooter, you cant ask for a better camera for the money.So I recommend this camera to anyone who needs a camera for that purpose which is why I bought it myself.</Content>

<Content>This camera has some issues that are annoying
as do all point and shoot cameras in the 
$100 to $150 range.

The one thing that sets this camera apart from
all (or most) other compacts is the VIEWFINDER. 

Too hard to shoot outdoors with an LCD that you 
can hardly see in the sunlight. 

What do I expect for $100.00 ??? 
A viewfinder so I can shoot outside. The 590IS is
the only compact Ive found that has one.

<Content>We got this for our 7 year old son for Christmas. We had other, cheaper, digital cameras for him before and he was never satisfied with the pictures he was getting. He could tell the difference between his pictures and the ones taken on our SLR (Cannon Rebel XT). This camera is user-friendly, as we have come to appreciate from Cannon. The pictures and options are great for the size and price. I have been waiting for a camera that is comparable to our SLR that isnt as large and with a price tag I could justify. This is pretty close to that camera and I have enjoyed when my son lets me use his. </Content>

<Content>This is the third Canon digital camera I have bought and they seem to improve each time. The camera is simple to use, though the easy feature is really more of a gimmick than added value, the unit as a whole is extremely easy to set up and use. Graet photos and easy interface with a PC for editing and reviews. Havent tried the digital video feature yet, but that is next. I would recommend the Canon 500 series over more expensive Panasonic and Sony cameras I have owned, which will now be retired.</Content>

<Content>Bought the Canon PowerShot A590 for my Mother who needs a camera that is easy to use.  This was perfect for her.  The Screen lists what mode you are in when the selecter dial at the top is rotated and there is an easy Selection on the dial that sets all of the parameters for you.  She was taking in-focus photos in minutes.  (She could never set the other older camera up to take in focus photos repeatably)  I have the powershot 560 at work and was amazed on how simple the functions were and decided this would be perfect for her but they changed models to the A590.  I would recommend buying a 4 pack of 2650mAh recharchable NiMH duracells for $10. (You will need a charger as well.)  And a larger capacity card.  I would recommend a 2Gig card that should only cost you around $8.    </Content>

<Content>I purchased the Canon PowerShot A590IS for my wife and she is relating easily to it. I wanted a compact camera that was not too tiny (tiny things get lost or misplaced too easily), an easy point-and-shoot camera, but capable of sophisticated manipulation by a photographer who wants more control. This is a good choice. The controls and functions are very intuitively organized; it was easy to use right out of the box. I like that it uses standard AA batteries so refreshing batteries is simple and quick (you can certainly use rechargable batteries and a separate charger, but you are not limited to proprietary batteries). There are many ways to download images from camera to computer. I recommend it for anyone who wants ease of use and versatility.</Content>

<Content>I am an advanced photographer.  My husband always wants to use my equipment.  Im not really eager to do that considering my equipment has cost me thousands of dollars -- and he wants to take it to the hunting camp :) in the dirt, on the stand, in the water, etc., etc.  

So............I am loyal Canon user.  

This camera had great reviews.  Appeared to have a lot of the DSLR features and a bonus movie taking feature so I thought it would be a great advanced function camera for him.

He will use the auto mode most of the time to take pictures but I am slowly teaching him all of the other advanced functions that he can use on the camera.  

When I have shown him what functions this camera has in comparison to my SLR and we have been quite impressed.

He loves this camera and for the price you get so many advanced functions it is well worth it.

And if you drop it at the hunting camp you are not out thousands of dollars so its a good thing.</Content>

<Content>This PowerShot A590IS is simple and easy to use. I dont know much about photography and dont want to have to take courses to take a picture. I work in the Oil Field and come across some neat stuff. So its fun for me to carry my camera in my truck and get shots of this stuff. This camera is easy to use to document and cover your tail with too. I recommend this one for anybody who wants a point and click easy to use camera.  </Content>

<Content>Got this camera for my daughter who is 11. The camera works well and is very easy to use. 
The lag time from going from shot to shot is a bit long 1 second or 2 but exceptable.
The pictures are good and the video is better then I thought it would be. I burned a 5 minutes video to DVD and it turned out at about the quality of a standard vhs video camera from 80s or 90s in quality. I realize video has come a long way but this is not bad for a little point and shoot. So I would think this camera would be good for trips and traveling simply because it takes good pictures, takes decent, dvd burnable, video, and takes AA batteries you can buy any where any place. Also with a 8gb card we get over 2,200 pictures or over 1.5 hours of video or a combination of photo video at the cameras highest quality settings. </Content>

<Content>I wanted a digital camera for around $100...I checked online for reviews and found this camera got great reviews. Even though it was a little bit more in cost, I think its well worth it. Also, when I bought it the price was lower (Id seen it for $149-$179) but actually paid $112.95 for it on Amazon. Its so easy to use (frankly I havent even opened the manual yet). It takes great photos with no effort. And what I really love is that it takes great photos in the dark. I was at an event with very little light, and when I took pictures they came out just as well as if I was outside during the day. Great buy for the money, well worth it...and most importantly verrrry easy to use. Buy it, you wont be sorry.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera [[ASIN:B0011ZCDKS Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom] for Christmas and it has all the functions I was looking for. The shutter speed is a little slow compared to some cameras in the same price range but after some adjusting in the menu, it can be compensated for. The menu interface is very user friendly after a quick glance through of the manual (which in all honesty does look like a small dictionary and reads like one too.) With a decent size memory card (2Gb and up) the capture video time was greatly increased. Great price, shipping was fast and price was very fair. I have already recommended this product to a few friends and we will be using it anywhere, anytime!</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for an upcoming vacation.  I figured for $100 I could drop it in the water, lose it, etc and not be upset since it was so cheap.  When it arrived, I was so surprised to see how great the photos came out, how easy it is to handle and how small it is.  I just cannot believe what a great deal this was.  Now, I am afraid to lose it!  Since other reviews have really hit on the specifics, I will only say that one of the most impressive features is the pet setting.  The only digital camera I own (I have 6 now) that could take photos of my cats without that awful white cat eye was my Canon EOS - in a completely different price range.  This camera takes photos even in the dark and my cats eyes are beautiful, just as if I took it in bright daylight!   What a fantastic deal!</Content>

<Content>I used to be a Kodak fan.  Well, Canon has just stolen me away with this camera.  I bought this camera for work to use for taking product photos.  I really liked the manual focus feature, the white balance feature, and the large screen.  After getting the camera, I took it for a test drive.  Kudos to whoever designed this brilliant machine.  Using the simpler features is intuitive.  The more complex features, while not intuitive, work smoothly once understood.  Using the manual mode in this camera is the easiest of any camera that I have used.  It includes a graph at the side of the screen to give more of an idea of how your picture will come out.  There is only one downside.  The viewfinder, should you want to use it, does not accurately portray what you are taking a picture of.  If you use it, you may find tha you will have to crop your pictures afterward to remove objects you didnt anticipate showing up in your photo.  But, then again, who would use the viewfinder when you have a razor sharp 2.5 LCD screen.  Overall, this is a great camera.  Im going to buy one for my wife who wants an SLR eventually.</Content>

Does produce a lot of noise in low light shooting, but gives a wide range of options for adjusting shutter speed and aperture, so you can experiment a bit and get an image that pleases you.  Like that it takes regular batteries and seems to have good life for the alkalines that came with it.  Not overly small so its easy to handle, and the controls are pretty straightforward.  Overall, B+, and thats good for the price of this camera.</Content>

<Content>I am an old film guy who scoffed at digital but decided to buy this camera for my wife because of its point and shoot capabilities.  The pictures she took on a recent vacation turned out great, and those that didnt resulted from operator error.  For those of us who feel compelled to impose our artistic selves upon the photos we take, this little camera has enough controls to satisfy.  The photo stabilization feature is great for those of us whose hands are not very stabilized any longer. It is also small, unobtrusive and light weight. Not a big old brick hanging on a string around your neck!  I recommend  this camera to just about any one who is at the beginner/intermediate level and want to create some very nice photos</Content>

<Content>After tinkering with this camera in some detail, here is what I found:

Image Stablization: Quite effective. I have had very few blurry pictures, even though I was constantly taking pictures with shutter speed of 1/8 ~ 1/15.

Battery: The low battery warning comes up prematurely sometimes, and it is quite annoying. Once I figure out that I can easily take 400+ photos on a set of Eneloop (or Rayovac Hybrid), I have learned to simply ignore the warning. I love the fact that it uses AA batteries, one less device I have to remember to charge.

Auto Mode: If you allow the camera to decide all the settings for you, you should be able to take decent pictures consistently. Good lighting produces good pictures, bad lighting produces bland pictures, on par with most other entry level cameras. Noise level at ISO 320 is not noticeable, unless you are looking for it.

Shutter/Aperture Priority Mode: Disappointing. The EV setting does not work properly when the flash is activated. And I use flash a lot in non-auto mode.

Manual Mode: Great feature. You can combine different levels of flash with proper ISO and shutter speed to get great result. Instead of bland, washed-out indoor pictures, I was able to obtain good vibrant photos. Once you get the hang of it, you are usually adjusting between flash level and shutter speed, so its not very complex to use.

Size: Its a little too thick to fit in pants pocket, but should fit in some coat pocket fine. Its shape provides good grip, allowing better shot taking.

Flash: The recycle time is fast enough for me. I suspect its due to Eneloop.

Reboot: The camera sometimes slows down after extended use. This is easily corrected by shutting it off, then turning it back on.

Overall this camera is very fun to play with. The manaul adjustments allow you to do so much more than a regular point and shoot camera. However, when you bring your A590 to the company party, you would wish some of these features are available in the auto mode too. As a practical camera: 4.5 stars. As a toy: 5 stars.</Content>

<Content>This is my second time purchasing this camera. I have one for myself, and I bought this one for my son. I love the fact that it uses AA batteries, so I can carry extra and not find myself with no battery power. Also, it has the little eye view finder, which is very rare in digital cameras, so I dont have to worry about screen white-out. I wouldve rated it 5-star if I didnt have to wait so long between taking pictures, but to be honest, thats been a problem with every digital camera Ive owned. This one is my favorite.</Content>

<Content>Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom  I ended up getting 4 of these for Christmas gifts because after the first two came, I was so struck by the quality, quickness of focusing, features and ease of use that I got two more.  3 of the 4 were for older people that dont have a digital camera, so I liked that you could pretty much put the dial on Auto or Easy and leave it there.  You can do that because theres a separate switch for taking pictures and playing back.  My daughter loves that function (shes 5).  She had a kids camera last Christmas but the pictures and function of that camera didnt encourage her to use it.  This one she loves and has started wanting to play with the other features like the timer and taking movies. </Content>

Certainly its no DSLR but for the money it has every feature you could want for a point and shoot and takes excellent shots.  They had a blast learning about the macro function and how easy it is to use.  I am tempted to buy another one for myself to use until I can afford the 50 D.</Content>

The replacement battery was hard to find, and that is another problem.  Besides that, the camera takes very good picture, but a little noisy.    </Content>

<Content>No creo que pueda llamarme un fotógrafo amateur por que en realidad estoy un poco antes de eso, más que todo utilizo mi cámara para tomarle fotos a mi hijo cuando salimos juntos o cuando salgo de parranda con mis amistades, la calidad de las fotos en la modalidad automática, que es casi la única que utilizo, son muy buenas no puedo quejarme, me ha gustado mucho la calidad de las imágenes, tanto en interiores como exteriores. Desde hace 3 años poseo una nikon 4600 coolpix, muy buena cámara para ser solo una point and shoot con varias opciones que resultan interesantes, la calidad de las imágenes son excelentes no tenia comparación,  otras que tuve la oportunidad de manipular de marcas reconocidas tales como Samsung y sony (point and shoot) no superaron en lo absoluto a mi nikon, creí que no encontraría una cámara que a mi punto de vista y para lo que la utilizo, la superara hasta que encontré la canon 590IS (mas que todo hable en el sentido de precio bajo, claro que hay muchas cámaras mas que puedan superar a mi nikon y a la canon que acabo de comprar).
Sé que puedo sacarle mucho más provecho a mi cámara canon utilizando todas las opciones que posee, a mi parecer es una cámara profesional en pequeño, ya que te permite poder cambiar la obturación, las ISO, velocidad de disparo y muchas cosas más, algo complicado pero con un menú sumamente amigable, a medida que vaya entrando mas en el tema de la fotografía y consultando a personas que tienen mayor experiencia se que podre obtener fotos espectaculares.
Un punto más a favor de la 590IS es que puedo adaptarle lentes, para tener un mayor zoom o para el aumento del ángulo de visión, aun que debo de ganar más experiencia en fotografía para meterme a la compra de estos lentes.

<Content>I purchased this camera for my 70+ mother whose Kodak digital camera had died.  She found the transition to this camera very easy.  If you are at all familiar with digital cameras, the controls are very obvious and easy to use.  It uses regular AA batteries, so she doesnt have to worry about a special battery and charger.  A big plus.  At 8 MP, the photos are excellent quality, more than enough for making 4x6 prints or sending digital images with email or posting on the Internet.  I am a very advanced photographer and I thought this is a great point and shoot camera.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera b/c it was so similar to my first ever digital camera a Canon which was excellent but as time went by I decided to upgrade and was conned into buying a panasonic lumix LS70. It took crappy pictures even my old Canon took better pictures, so not even a year and I decide to get a new camera and went back to old faithful Canon and I am not disappointed. 

The camera takes excellent pictures, easy to use if I just want to take some quick shots and good manual settings for when I want to experiment with taking some shots. I actually like the size, most people may not like it but I am notorious for dropping my tech items and it would be the death of compact cameras in my hand. Even with its size it will fit in a average sized jeans pocket or even a small purse in the case of a woman. The only setback why I gave it a four is that when the flash is on there is a delay for taking the next shot but I believe most can live with that. 

Advice - get some 2400nimh AA batteries it helps with the lag.

Highly recommend</Content>

<Content>I had already ordered a camera for my kids to take pictures for about $34 less than this one. However, I decided to explore a bit more on what was out there, since my first choice was based on my budgeted price. I read the reviews about the camera and immediately cancelled my order and ordered this camera. I was not sure about the size of the camera because when we go to parties, I do not want to be invenience with a bulky camera.  The reviews however were stronger than my bulky problem. To my amazement, I do not have a bulky problem, the camera is small, compact, light, it takes amazing pictures. I love the face view finder feature, I do remember reading about it on the description, but I was hoping this camera had that feature, and I did get it. By the time I came home, my 12 year old already had inserted a 4gb memory card (purchased seperate) and created a movie dancing with this friends, the picture was amazing. I love my camera, I love the quality of the picture, the quality of the video, thinking of give it to my niece for the 16th birthday. Oh, the battery is lasting for a long time, I am still waiting to change the battery and a replace has not been necessary. On my old digital camera, we had to, had to replace the batteries every 20 pictures or so. thumps up to Canon for producing a great product for someone on a budget and thumps up to Amazon.com, received my camera one day head of delivery schedule, Great job</Content>

<Content>May be I havent used enough to write review since I bought this camera a month ago. But I used Canon Rebel (big one) with similar function for 5 years. I found this cheaper but newer one is better than old one which is 8 times more expensive back then.
Image stabilizer function is especially working great. I took picture indoor lit not enough. But it came out quite sharp. 
If you dont mind a little bigger size, I recommend this camera. No need to spend more money. </Content>

<Content>I owned a Powershot A70 for years and when I was in the market for a new camera, I thought I would try the Kodak EasyShare M863.  I had tons of problems with that camera- flash wasnt working right, (it had to be sent in for warranty repair twice), images were blurry/not crisp and I could not see the LCD screen in bright sunlight (no viewfinder).  After so many problems I saw that Amazon had a good deal and good reviews on this Canon camera.  I have been using it for a few months now and so far I love it.  The picture quality is excellent (so much better than the Kodak), I love that is has a viewfinder in addition to the LCD screen and I love that it is easier to hold and take a steady picture with one hand (the slim cameras are very difficult to hold steady).  Another nice feature is that in playback mode, you can view what settings you had the camera in when you took the picture which is helpful when playing with the different settings to see what achieves the best picture.

My only complaint like everyone states is that it really uses the batteries.  The batteries that came with the camera seemed to last a while but once those ran out and I switched to my rechargeables, it seems like I have to replace the batteries after every picture session.  I always keep extra charged batteries with me but I dont remember going through them so quickly with the A70.  Overall though I am willing to sacrifice a low battery life with high quality, easy to take pictures.</Content>

<Content>I consider myself a little bit of a photography buff, though I prefer my 35mm Pentax to anything digital. So with this Canon I was pleasantly surprised at all of the features. It ranges from a simple, user-friendly choice with automatic settings and multiple atmosphere settings, to a more complex, manual camera with a whole depth of features that make it fun to capture exactly what you want. Since I enjoy the manual aspect of 35mm, I really love the fact that I can change ISO, shutter speed, F stop, focus and everything else to really achieve the results Im looking for. Its the first digital camera Ive owned that actually operates like a camera and not a computer. Nice big screen, sturdy body, easy operating buttons  functions. I love it.

The ONLY thing I dont like about it is how fast it goes through batteries. You should really get some rechargeable ones to go with this because I can go through 2AAs in one day easily with this thing.</Content>

<Content>We have another model and bought this as a gift for my 80 year old mother who had expressed an interest in a digital camera. (And also purchased some rechargeable batteries and a recharger). It is not a pocket size, but it is pretty small.

It seems to take fine pictures for her purposes. With a short hands-on experience, she is comfortable with it. Despite a little arthritis in her hands, she can open the battery/SD card compartment to change batteries or take the card out for reading on her computer. We chose it because it had a view finder as well as the screen. (I appreciate using the viewfinder when I dont have my reading glasses handy since then I cant focus well on any screen. I imagined that the same would apply for my mother). 

It can be a little slow in taking pictures, but from our experience with another model, that will be alleviated when we get a fast (class 6) SDHC card for her. It came with a 512MB card that was nothing special. It would be sensible to upgrade that as soon as possible with something like a 4 or 8GB class 6 card and high speed card reader.

The only thing I do not like (perhaps I just didnt read the manual carefully enough to figure it out) is I cannot change the stored image names to a more unique and identifiable naming scheme that uses the date in the name. The best I can do is specify that it never reuse a number over, but it starts at img_0001.jpeg and goes from there. </Content>

<Content>This my wifes first digital camera.  For someone who tends to avoid new technology, she really likes it.  She likes that it has a view finder because she is not comfortable holding it away from her face and just looking at the lcd screen.  She also likes that it uses AA batteries so that she can bring extras whith her instead of having to plug the camera into a charger.  She has only used it indoors so far, but the photos are very clear and the lighting is perfect.  Her old camera was fine outside in natural light, but the indoor photos were poor.  That makes this camera a hit for her.  She needed a little help figuing out the timer, but since we have teens in the house, they showed her what to do.  I really like that it uses SD cards because they are much less expensive than the Memory Sticks used by the Sony.  If you leave the camera set for max resultion (8MP) the memory cards can fill up quicker than you think.</Content>

<Content>Hey Everyone.  My first review, but I am so very happy with this camera.  I bought it as a replacement for a Kodak DX7630 6.1MP I bought 4 years ago.  The price I got this camera for here of $109.99, is by far the least expensive Ive seen.  It is only 1/3 the price of my old camera and by far superior.  
Some points...
1) Takes great shots, and with being able to adjust every setting, including focus, if auto or easy mode for some reason didnt get it, then you could.
2)Movie modes.  Many to choose from.  The smallest is super for e-mail.  The largest although running better than a Meg a second is awesome, even at 20 FPS. I think it takes better movies, definitely in low light, then my digital camcorder.
3) The only negative I could mention is that in the highest fine picture mode (which is not the default), the processing time between shots can be long.  Sometimes even 5-7 seconds. However, its default mode is superb.  I just figure finer is better, since I downsize pics and so want to start with the most picture info.  The time lag doesnt bother me.  If I needed rapid shots, Id switch modes, or use burst.
4) It uses 2 AA batteries.  I put rechargeables in it.  They have never run out on me.  However, I always recharge after every large usage occasion.
5) I just got this at Christmas and havent even gotten through the manual yet.  It does so much and Im always discovering more.
6) For example..my son had a concert.  I was way in the back.  From my seat, to him on the stage, only the stage lit, with full digital zoom going (16x), it captured a more then usable shot.  I was amazed!
7) So bottom line...I love it!  Even if it was $150 it would have been worth it.

<Content>This camera replaces an older Canon digital. I wanted a camera with no fancy settings and very easy to use in a small product. I liked the idea of this one using long lasting and cheaper Sanyo Eneloop AA batteries. I will not be printing or blowing up many if any pictures so this 8MP with 4X Zoom more than fits my needs. I primarily use this for E-bay and family shots that I store on discs. While I am still learning how to operate this camera, I do notice that the time it takes to shoot one picture after another does take a bit of time, several seconds. The quality seems to be good and I am happy so far.</Content>

After using the camera for a month I have no negatives. Its very easy to use yet offers quite a bit of control over the exposure when you dont want auto exposure. Battery life is very good. This unit also has excellent macro capabilities. I like the fit and feel in the hand since I dont care for really thin and flat cameras. All in all you cant go wrong with the A590IS at the current price.</Content>

<Content>I can only review my opinion with regard to the seller.  The seller shipped the product to us safely and in a timely manner.  It was protected in the packaging extremely well and arrived in the best condition. This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my parents (ages 70  74).  They havent used the camera yet but we purchased it for ease of handling and simplicity of use.  We were able to put it in our hands before purchasing as this particular item was at a local shop.  The little bump out handle makes it so nice to hold onto, as opposed to all the new dig. cams that are so flat and skinny and therefore easily dropped.   Im sure my folks will enjoy using this camera instead of all the disposables they were going through.</Content>

<Content>Plenty of features in a compact design, a great camera for beginning and intermediate photographers. The camera isnt quite a shirt-pocket camera, but small enough to be easily carried. 

The 2.5 LCD is bright and crisp. The only issue with the LCD is the noise in low light conditions or when using the digital zoom. The noise is filtered out of the picture, but is still visible in the LCD. 

The red-eye reduction feature is buried in the menu system, which makes it difficult to easily turn on or off, but the function can be assigned to the print button for one-touch access. The red-eye reduction feature works extremely well compared to older generation cameras. A lamp is used prior to exposure to reduce red-eye and any red-eye you may get is removed during processing. 

The various shooting modes are great when used as intended. The action shot (high speed shutter) was available on older Canon models, but is missing on this model. I have yet to blur an action shot, but Ive only taken action shots in bright sunlight. If you need a faster shutter in low light conditions, it can be manually adjusted in the Tv mode. Once again, plenty of features, and plenty of manual adjustments for the creative photographer. 

If you intend on shooting 8MP photos, invest in a good SDHC Class 4 or better memory card. The SDHC cards have faster transfer rates than standard SD cards. The class rating on SDHC cards indicates the minimum write speed in MB/Sec. A class 4 SDHC card will write an 8MP photo to memory in slightly less than 1 second. A faster write means youre ready for the next shot sooner.</Content>

My only complaint is that when taking videos, you have four choices for quality, one which is small and poor quality but compact, and three that are very good but take up a large amount of memory. I wish there was some medium format or mpeg4 format that would be easy to use. Still, I would highly recommend this camera.</Content>

It arrived in perfect condition, has many different settings, and --for those who dont use cameras often-- has an Auto setting.

The SD card that comes with it is really small and only allows one to take a few shots on it before it is full.</Content>

<Content>If I had known it takes so long for the camera to be ready for the next picture, I would have bought something else.  If you want a camera that takes a picture when you press the button, buy a different camera.  Or, if you want a camera that can take multiple pictures quickly, buy a different camera.  This is a great camera for taking group pictures, outdoor pictures or things that dont move.  Dont buy it to take action shots.  Youll miss every one of them.</Content>

<Content>Wife got me this for Christmas, because my trusty Coolpix 880 died.
Lots of manual control, flash is a bit weak, a off-camera flash port
would have been nice. Hey, for $109- who cares? Very good image quality,
flesh tones go a little pink, but all Canons have had that and easily
fixed in photoshop. Short video clips are a plus, too. Best buy sells 
these for $50 more than Amazon, get a brain and stop buying in brick 
and mortar stores. Unless you dont need money. If that be the case, 
send it to me, LOL</Content>

<Content>Purchased this camera for my in-laws for Christmas.  They are in their early 80s and we wanted something easy for them to operate -- point and click basically.  The shape of the camera itself was also a consideration as it seemed easy to hold onto.  The quality of the pictures is fantastic!  They are extremely happy with the camera and its features.  Instructions that came with the camera were easy to follow as far as getting the pictures onto the computer which concerned them as they arent very computer savy.   All in all, very happy with the purchase!</Content>

Well my husband is going to Iraq so we needed two digital cameras. I researched budget digital cameras and this one came up #1 almost every single time. I told my husband which ever camera turned out to be better I was keeping! Well this camera blew me away! I didnt realize how washed out the background colors seemed to be with my other camera, it never captured the real light! This camera does! I love it, it takes great pictures, they are life like pictures and when looking at a picture I just took on the screen and looking up at what I took the pic of, they look exactly the same. I love this camera, and Im so glad I got it!</Content>

<Content>Ill leave the detailed feature reviews for those who have the time to write for free, but this camera is a great value for the money. It has aperture priority and shutter speed priority settings, as well as a host of scene modes that shift the white balance to the lighting for various scenes. Theres even an aquarium mode, which Ive tested and found to be very useful. 

There are so many features that one might feel overwhelmed, but you can start taking pictures immediately with the easy mode or the auto mode and let the camera take care of things for you. You can disable flash in all modes, so if you are using easy mode in a museum where you arent permitted to take flash pictures, you can turn it off. 

Battery life is much better than the last camera I had (a Fuji Finepix 1300), and it takes 1/2 as many batteries (2 versus 4) also. I use the Duracell 2650 ma/hr rechargeable NiMH batteries, the highest capacity I could find locally, and keep 2 spares freshly charged. I havent tried this camera on alkaline batteries but I would expect shorter battery life, though probably better than in most cameras. 

Zoom works well. It stops at 4x optical when you zoom but it can go further with digital zoom (with some picture degradation, of course), up to 16x. I like the fact that it stops you from going beyond the maximum optical zoom before you enter the digital zoom, and beyond 4x it changes the magnification factor number to blue characters, so 5.5x would be blue, to warn you that you are beyond the optical zooms capabilities. Its easy to mute the camera when you turn it on if you need to be quiet when you take a snapshot, as in some nature photography. You just have to hold one button on while you turn the camera on and it puts it in mute mode so the camera doesnt beep every time you push a button to change some setting.

Great camera, great price at $109, and you can find it in the Amazon Marketplace for about $10 less right now from Adorama Camera as a refurbished unit if you dont mind that. I would have bought one of those refurbs from them but at the time there were none for sale below $109 anywhere else. 

If you need more features and greater zoom range, consider the 10x model, but this one got the greatest overall reviews everywhere (not just on Amazon) and that was a major decider for me. </Content>

I just read the owners manual a little on the plane on the way over and was snapping away in no time.  A full day of taking pictures, I would get about 150 pictures with one set of AA batteries.  The color of the pictures is great and it was small enough to carry every place.  The AA battery is available every place so it was easy to keep it going.  It took an 8 Gig mem card (sdhc) so I could take over 2000 pictures on the highest setting!</Content>

This is great while traveling outside the US since you dont need a converter to keep it charged.  The batteries last quite awhile.  While not among the smallest of digital cameras it is still small enough to carry around and keep in a day bag. the 8mp give you nice sharp photos.  Because of the reasonable price I even take it kayaking...stored safely in a water tight box. No worries!</Content>

<Content>We bought this camera as a Christmas gift for my 12 year old daughter.  The balance of reasonable price, performance and features made it a good choice for her first digital.  The automatic modes make it easy for her to take great pics until she learns to use the more advanced modes.  I recommend handling it carefully and storing it in a case to protect the LCD screen.  There are already a few small scratches on hers.  One significant drawback is that it seems to be power hungry.  Fortunately we bought rechargeable AAs too.  Granted many flash pictures were taken on Christmas day, but the alkalines that came with it were gone by the second day.</Content>

<Content>My son bought this camera for me this Christmas and Im still learning how to use it, but Ill do some pros and cons here:

Pros:  View finder, large LCD screen, great macro setting, nice size with hand grip.

Cons:  Long delays between shots, grainy at long range, flash too bright, no neck strap.

I really like the feel of this camera, and I love the view finder, but overall its a step down from my present camera.  I have a Konica Minolta Dimage Z20, 5 megapixels and 8X optical.  I love that camera but its too bulky to take everywhere.  It doesnt have the image stabilizer but it seems to take clearer pictures than the Canon does.  However, the macro on the Canon is much better than the KM, and thats important to me.

Im really concerned with the long delay between shots, and if anyone can tell me how to fix this, I would appreciate it.  Im not especially techno-savvy and that thick manual is pretty intimidating! (But at least it comes with a manual.) </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera only after reading many of the excellent reviews of it. Sadly, none of the reviews I found mentioned how cheap this camera feels. As soon as I opened the box, I noticed that it was made out of cheap plastic, and several of the buttons were loose and shaky. I thought that I would get used to it, but every time I picked it up, it seemed to feel more cheap and plasticky. The picture quality on it was about average. Nothing special and a little grainy. That picture quality would only be acceptable on a cheaper camera with a more sturdy build. The Canon is also very slow. It takes a long time to turn on, and a long time to focus and take a picture. The many delays can be devastating if you plan to us the camera taking nature pictures. An animal could runaway before you have the camera turned on. Because of all these things, I returned it the same day that it came. I gave this camera two stars instead of one only because of the considerable number of high reviews. There must be something good about this camera, however, I could not see what it was.I bought the Nikon Coolpix S550 camera instead. It feels very sturdy, and can take excellent pictures. I have even dropped it several times and the Nikon barely scratched (this camera felt as if it would shatter if you were to drop it). However, if money is not a factor, and you dont care to much about picture quality, and you can be very gentle with this fragile camera, then this is the camera for you. </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for its price.  I wanted something that took a good photo and if I needed to replace it (or I lost it), it wouldnt be a total loss.  The cameras pictures are pretty good, however, its response is very, very slow.  To boot up the camera, focus on a subject, and shoot a picture takes up to 20 seconds.  Pressing the shoot button often results in a 1+ second response.  If you are not perfectly focused on the subject(s) (i.e. when taking a picture of 2 people, if the center focus comes to rest between the subjects) the foreground comes out blurry.

Overall, its a good camera for someone who has never had a digital camera before.  Im going back to the Powershot/Elph series.</Content>

<Content>Im not the most technical person so keep that in mind =)

I bought this camera to replace out 5 year old Kodak EasyShare DX4530. It was dropped one too many times and gave up. I would rate that camera as a 5 star (non professional) camera as a comparison.

I did not want to spend a lot and the reviews and price on this camera were good. I have had it for a couple months and have been pleased. The pictures, for the most part, turn our very nice. There are many options for picture taking ie...kidspets, portrait, action, etc. and other setting to play with if you know what they mean or do. I mostly keep it on auto. Low light picture taking is difficult. The flash is VERY bright so if you want mood lighting (taking a pic of kids blowing out candles) you are out of luck! The flash tends to wash things out, especially if you are a little close. The contrast in pictures is something I regularly have to fix with photo editing software. I sometimes also have to fix the definition as pictures sometimes come out soft. I have had an issue with odd reddish shadows once in a while but Im not sure why. Zooming in on things makes them a bit grainy. The video feature is great! You would not want to use the camera as a video camera but if you need to catch that spontaneous moment, it will do. 

The camera itself seems sturdy. The rubbery plastic door that closes over the USB port is the only part Im concerned about breaking. For a small camera it is pretty heavy. If you want something to slip into your jeans this is probably not the right camera. It is perfect for a small purse though. It is small in length and height but it is pretty wide because of the battery compartment.

For the price, and as an everyday camera, I am very happy.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera to replace my 3-year-old Konica/Minolta Dimage 6.  The Konica had a 12X optical zoom, one of the reasons I purchased it in the first place.  But the 12X optical zoom made the camera a little bulky.  Too bulky to slip into my coat pocket or a small carrying case.  Because of that, I found myself taking fewer and fewer photos.  Enter the Canon PowerShot A590 IS.  So far, I am totally happy with this camera.  First of all, its size is perfect for me.  It fits neatly into a coat pocket, or sometimes into even my pants pocket.  Though it only has a 4X optical zoom, its 8MP ability allows me to PhotoShop the scenes I cant zoom in on enough with very little loss of resolution.  I take the majority of my photos at the 5MP setting.  At this setting, with a 4 Gb card, I can store over 2700 photos.  The color settings are great too.  I have the options of B/W, sepia, neutral, vivid, and custom.  And the vivid setting lives up to its meaning; the colors just pop!  I also chose this camera because of the shutter and aperture priority settings; I like to make my own settings on occasion.  Most of the compact digitals out there now no longer allow that.  But it still has enough presets for those who dont want to fiddle...full auto, easy, program, portrait, landscape, night snapshot, kids  pets, indoor, sunset, and video.  Since I havent taken any video with it yet, I cant comment on that feature.  The view screen doesnt have as many pixels as some of the other compact digitals.  So if you compare what you see on the view screen with those having more pixels, it wont be as sharp and clear.  But dont think that will take away from the actual finished photo...it doesnt.  The view screen image on most digitals is very hard or next to impossible to see in bright sunlight.  Thats why this camera is great.  It has a viewfinder; something else one doesnt see much any more.  It may seem a bit old-fashioned, but when the sun is at your back and youre trying to frame your subject, and the view screen becomes useless, youll be very glad you have a viewfinder.  All in all, a great little camera; well worth the money.  I absolutely recommend this camera.  Ive heard a rumor that Canon has discontinued this model, so get one while you still can.</Content>

<Content>This camera takes beautiful, clear pictures. Beats my cybershot by a mile for clarity and details. Easily worth the twice the price paid. I have not had battery life problems, and AAs are always available everywhere. Shopped online and got a couple of 4 GB HD-SC cards, (for less than $20) They should be good for thousands of highest quality shots, or hours of video. Feels good in the hand, light weight, and has good placement of the control buttons. I made a fun picture using the included photo stitching software, by sitting in a chair and taking 12 shots around the room, then stitching them together. Pan the image while viewing, and it looks really cool! Highly recommended, even for non technical users, great pictures automatically in easy mode. Plenty of manual settings to play with too. Best sub $200 camera on the market, I got it for $105 shipped. :o)

<Content>Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom

My one Daughter lost her camera, so I gave her my two year old Kodak point and shoot camera and hit the Internet to find me a replacement for that one. After spending several hours looking and reading reviews, I picked the Cannon A590IS. The things I liked about the camera when I first saw it, was the shape. I dont like those real small flat ones. They are great to stick in your shirt pocket, but are hard to hold steady and shoot. This one had a nice handle like grip where the batteries fit in and you can hold it and shoot with one  hand if you want to. Its still small enough to fit into a coat pocket, purse and pants pocket. It had great reviews and the price was great.I sure wasnt disappointed when I got it and got a chance to use it. It was everything people were saying it was. Easy to figure out, took great pictures and had a good zoom.

I wanted a camera that used AA batteries, which you can find anywhere if your batteries die on you. The Cannon had that too. But it had something my Kodak didnt have and that was a view finder. Not many cameras have a view finder anymore. It really comes in handy when the sun is bright and washes out your LCD screen.But I soon discovered another great use for it. The view finder can stretch the life of your batteries a long way. On many shots, I turn the screen off and shoot using the view finder. The screen will light up for a second or two and show me what I shot and turn off again. That really is a great battery saver if used and would take care of most of the complaints about this camera. 

There are so many features on this camera, both automatic and adjustable that its hard to believe it sells for so little. It should satisfy the needs of about anyone, novice or skilled camera user.

A good safety feature you can use, is when putting your camera away, put the switch in (review) mode and not in (shoot)mode. That way if it accidentally gets turned on, the lens wont open up and push against what ever you put it in with and mess up the lens.

I liked this camera so much, I just ordered two more. One for my other Daughter and one for my Son. They should get them this week and Im sure they will love it as much as I do.

If your looking for a good point and shoot camera with most of the bells and whistles on it and small enough to put in your pocket, but big enough to get a good grip on it, you cant go wrong with this camera. You will love this Cannon.</Content>

<Content>Overall, this is a great little camera. I chose this product for four reasons: Canon quality, features offered, use of AA batteries, and the ability to add converter lenses. Unfortunately, that last item leaves a lot to be desired. I had to send the first camera back because you could not get the lens ring off the camera to put a converter lens on. The replacement camera took about a half dozen people trying before the lens ring would budge. And it is still very difficult to get off. The only way it will come off is if you have something like a rubber band to grab it with - bare hands dont work. So that is a major nuisance and as far as I am concerned very poorly designed.</Content>

What has been the experience of others using the Canon A590IS with different Battery types (Lithium, NiMh low discharge rechargeables)? Thanks to all in advance.</Content>

<Content>We bought this camera for our 12 year old son this year because he loves using ours and he also loves making silly videos, so we thought about getting a kids cam for him at first, but the reviews for them were horrible, so we checked all over Amazon and found this one to have the best overall rating. I have to say that everyone was right on target with this one. Im not a camra geek or a professional photographer, but this is a really nice camera, even for an adult. It takes great pics in the dark and obviously in the light. The video quality is nice and I like that it doesnt have a swing out view window that could possibly be broken off. I gave this camera a 5* because its just an awesome well made camera for just about anyone.</Content>

<Content>I recently bought the Canon PowerShot A590IS from Amazon at a great price ($109). So far, I am really enjoying it--its my first digital camera and it is simple to use. Here are a few details about the camera that I didnt know before I bought it.

Batteries: It does come with batteries. Two AA batteries were included, which only lasted two days (which I expected from regular batteries). Ive since bought rechargeable batteries, based on other reviewers advice.

Memory card: A memory card is included, but it only has enough room for about twenty pictures. Just enough to test the camera out and take a few practice photos of my office. Good thing I ordered another memory card along with the camera.

View finder: Not only does this camera have the standard digital camera screen, it also has an old-fashioned (like from regular cameras) view finder. I like this because I can take a picture even if there is glare on the digital screen. Also I find it helpful to look through the small view finder when there is a lot of motion.

Easy shot: The easy mode is really truly easy, and it produces really good pictures.

Design: Aside from the price, I picked this camera after looking at it in a retail store because of the user friendly design. Unlike many other digital cameras, it is not a small thin square. It has a rounded side that makes it easy to grip and more substantial feeling. At the same time, it is very light and small and easy to carry in my purse or coat pocket.

Overall ease of use: I found the camera to be simple to use and all of the included instructions to be useful and easy to follow.


I really do love this camera so far and would highly recommend it.

<Content>I got myself a Canon Powershot A590IS digital camera and received it on Nov 4. While using it on Thanksgiving day, I was suprised to see a yellow blinking light and a low battery signal. I even accused my husband of putting old batteries on my new camera! Poor guy, he said he just opened a package since he knew that we will be taking a lot of pictures. So what we did was change the batteries again...guess what..after 5 pictures with the new batteries, it was blinking again and then abruptly shut off! The camera was defective. I read a review on Canons website about having the exact same problem.  I bought a Canon because a relative got one and it was working well.  I am very disappointed with this model...to think that it was highly recommended and reviews were great.  I should have researched more and read the pros and cons of the reviews esp. the ones on Canons website. Amazon promised to replace it, lets see if the replacement unit is better.</Content>

<Content>I bought 2 of these cameras as gifts based on online reviews and price.  I couldnt be happier.  The first one was for my college-age son, (worlds worst photographer!) and he used it straight out of the box and had a ball with it.  The second one was for my mother, (very technology-challenged senior) who was looking for a camera that would give better pix than her Kodak Easy Share.  The camera is compact, neat, stylish, and very easy to use!  Takes very nice pix, easy to transfer to computer or printer, and alot of fun and almost no stress to learn.  I got both recipients a SDHC 4GB memory card to go with their camera just to avoid the need to switch out the smaller card that comes with the camera.  Also, I love Cannon products, but Im not a great fan of the software that comes with their cameras. I have Photoshop myself and find that much better than the disk included in these sets.  </Content>

<Content>[[ASIN:B0011ZCDKS Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom]. This is a great camera for the casual user. I bought this camera for my wife and she absolutely loves it! The new easy function mode is great! She even commented on how fast the camera takes mulitple shots compared to our old Sony Cybershot. Also, the full price including sh was still $30-40 cheaper on Amazon compared to Circuit City and other electronic stores.  We only had one slight drawback, the battery life.  We used the AA batteries that came with the camera and after using the camera throughout the day from 10 am till 6 pm the low battery light came on. Fortunatley, we had an extra set of batteries and continued to enjoy taking pictures.
Overall, for the price, ease of use, the quality of pictures produce, this is a great camera!  Great Buy! Get it and you will love it!

<Content>Totally disappointing image sensor. wish it were with a 6MP sensor.
Just like you are shooting with a mobile cam-phone.

in order to test the sensor, i installed the custom firmware CHDK which enables RAW capturing. The result was as expected, noise noise noise..

Camera processes the RAW so intense that the resulting image is useless due to artifacts and its smoothness.

but for this money you cant expect much quality. This is something like a webcam. If you really want to play with manual settings, I advise you to go and buy an entry level D-SLR such as nikon d40.</Content>

<Content>Pros: Compact:fits in pocket; Uses standard AA batteries; viewfinder; Image Stabilized; Good sharpness; Ability to control exposure; comfortable in hand; price
Cons: Slow flash recycle; battery life may be so-so

As an advanced amateur I wanted a point and shoot camera that I could keep with me that was compact yet allowed me to control the exposure if I wanted to.  My DSLR is just to bulky to carry with me and too expensive to just leave laying around.  This camera meets my needs perfectly as it is compact and is one of the few Canon point and shoots that allows you to control exposure by aperture, shutter speed or manually.  This is handy when in difficult light situations, portraiture, and especially in landscape shooting.  Although the ability to use a histogram (a graph that tells you about the details of exposure) may not be used by many folks in everyday photography, it is available on this camera.  
The viewfinder allows you to hold the camera up to your face instead of having use the LCD screen by holding the camera away from you.  This allows you to hold the camera steadier and makes it easier to use the zoom controls.  I find it unbelievable that so few point and shoots have this what I consider to be necessary feature.  The view finder adjusts as you zoom the lens so you can see what you are shooting.
When you have too many megapixels in a small camera, you really dont gain anything useful, but you do loose picture quality, especially color quality.  This camera is just about right in that you should be able to make about a 16x20 inch print (or do some cropping)while still have good sharpness and quality.  The picture, compared to the 10 or more megapixel cameras, has bright colors and good sharpness.
The shape has a nice feel to it and it fits in my hand nicely.  The controls are easy to get to and the menus are fairly intuitive. 
Since I carry it in my brief case, I first used it at an office party and the pictures came out great.  The 8X10 group portrait was sharp with good colors and contrast.  Canon makes a great camera and this one is no exception.  What I dont understand is why it is so inexpensive compared with others in its class, yet has so many features.  I strongly recommend it for the person looking for a good point and shoot.
Enjoy it and take some good pictures.

<Content>The good: I bought this camera for its excellent price and brand name association. Its a great camera on the go. Takes AA batteries (get rechargeable for extended shooting time) a big plus in my needs. Takes incredible sunset pictures, indoor pictures,  Landscapes, movies are excellent too. Most all pictures turn out great nearly every time. IS is a bonus for the price. 
The limitations: Longer than normal cycle time when taking flash photos or outdoor bright photos. Macro leaves much to be desired. Other Canon point and shoot cameras have amazing macro ability. This camera does not. Zoom function while nice has a tendency to introduce blur with or without the IS on. 
Overall, I love this camera. For the price and its multitude of functions and the easy mode which is perfect for those who just want to turn on a camera and take great pics, this is a perfect camera. 
Note: I have taken over 4,000 pictures with this camera. And take it with me everywhere. </Content>

This camera does nothing extraordinary compared to others but had two things I wanted 1) a view finder  2) AA batteries. 
Pictures are very good

<Content>When I bought this camera, my intention was to have a camera that I could easily upload pictures onto my computer and I was not disappointed. I first, like most smart shoopers, did my research on this camera and it had great reviews, so I thought why not? I also did a search thru Yahoo for digital cameras to see what they might have because I did not want to just rely on the comments by Amazon customers(no offense). This little camera had some of the highest reviews and that sold me. It came fast and its smaller than you might think. The software was not a problem for me and all you need to do is follow the instructions point for point. Im a novice camera shooter so if that fits you and you want a nice digital camera, then get this one. You might can get some at cheaper prices, but this is Canon, they are know for making high quality cameras for a long time and this is another great product.</Content>

<Content>i had a powershot A75, that i dropped too many times and now it doesnt work. That is why i got the A590IS. Although the new camera has more megapixals and 1x more optical zoom, the picture quality is very similiar. For the money, i dont think you can get a better camera. However, my computer wont download the pictures from this camera just yet. Ive tried everything except reading the manual, so today i will do just that. i only gave this 4 stars becouse there are better cameras out there, but this camera is best in its class I would say. </Content>

<Content>I purchased my A590IS because of price and ease of hacking. Within minutes of receiving my camera I had installed CHDK on it and I had a camera with features of cameras costing much more. Now I can take awesome shots of lightning, save pictures in the RAW format, and take bracketed photos with ease. The quality of the camera is excellent and the Canon menus are easy to navigate and very intuitive. There are plenty of features for the experienced photographer and an Automatic mode that takes very nice pictures without any thought of ISO speed or any other variable. Battery life on the camera is reasonable, but I always keep a couple of extra batteries charged and ready to go. The body of this camera allows the use of accessory lenses. I purchased several of these lenses, along with the Canon adapter, and expanded the cameras capabilities even more. I like this camera so much that I am considering buying a second one so I can shoot stereoscopic images! </Content>

<Content>First off, the 8 mp advertised is quite inacurate. The pictures are hazy and the sharpness of the images are horrible! The flash stays on and distracts the person/animal that you are snapping a shot of. The shutter speed is slower than advertised. More minor details that also bother me:

The plastic has a cheap feel, the battery compartment WILL NOT LAST. The door holding the batteries in is barely strong enough. The plastic is so flimsy that it will break soon. The worst part of the camera to me is, to remove the SD card you must open the battery compartment, which resets the time and date. So, everytime you remove the SD card you have to reset the time and date which is NOT good for quick shots or battery life. The battery life is not good on this camera. I bought this model for the good reviews, I should have made my decision based on the the Cons instead of the Pros.</Content>

I sent it into Canon and they want 157 dollars to repair it or replace with a refurbished model.  It cost 259 new!  I wrote them and told them that I expected a lightly used expensive digital camera to work more than one year, but no dice.  Ill never buy another Canon.  Beware!</Content>

<Content>For a point and shoot, you cant beat the value on this Canon.  It is intuitive to use, has an easy setting, and produces great resolution in the photos.  My wife (not mechanically inclined) is able to take photos that rival professional quality.  The video function works great, and you can even zoom while filming, something our previous camera wouldnt do.  The only drawback is the long wait for the flash to reset, but that is offset by being able to use rechargeable AA batteries.  Would highly recommend this camera.  My mom is buying one for my dad this Christmas.</Content>

<Content>It seems that everyone is making their products cheaper these days.  I had a Canon Powershot Elph a few years ago, a 5 megapixel camera.  It took amazing photos and had great speed between pics.  So thats why when it broke, I chose another Canon.  I picked this model because it is a little bigger than the Elph series (and less expensive).  It was so slow to recover after shooting one picture (so that I could shoot the next one), I sent it back.  I then bought the Elph model, but didnt notice much difference in the time between shots.  Also, the material the new Elphs are made of is lighter and felt flimsier than the previous model I owned.  The A590IS, while being 8 MP, didnt seem better than my 5 MP.  In fact, quality of picture was a bit worse.    </Content>

<Content>Purchased the camera to take pictures on our Hawaii cruise.  The following reflects our requirements:

1.  Small and portable with good grip (not too skinny)
2.  Good zoom (3x or higher)
3.  LCD and viewfinder
4.  AA batteries
5.  Inexpensive
6.  Image stabilization
7.  Good reviews from amazon

After considering other point and shoot cameras, my wife and I settled for the 590IS.  It met all of our requirements and the pictures came out amazing.  Almost all of the outside pictures had exceptional details.  It made cropping and reducing picture size for sending out to friends and families very easy.  One buddy (photographer) noted how well the Cannon took pictures inside the house....not too noisy (within 5 feet, further and you will need an external flash which is expensive).  Another photographer buddy actually recommended this camera independently of my research.  We are glad that we received this camera prior to the trip.  We are truly delightful with the results.  One note for those taking a lot of inside pictures.  You will need an external flash unit (High-Power Flash HF-DC1 - about $100) to get good pictures beyond 5-7 feet.  I will start trying the manual controls for some creative picture taking.</Content>

This is impressive considering how hard it is for me to stand still. I love the stabilization this camera is equipped with. The image quality is great. I took a Christmas photo of my children and everyone though it was professional. Also, video quality is satisfactory for a camera at this price point and I can record up to an hour as long as my memory card is large enough to store my video. I havent toyed with the additional features very much, but Im sure they are nice to have as well. </Content>

<Content>Ive owned four 7MP+ cameras, and this one comes in last for picture quality. Considering this was half of the price of any of the others, Im not complaining too much. My primary reason for purchasing this inexpensive camera is so that my husband and daughter will stop borrowing mine, and that mission has now been accomplished. 

What I have found with this camera is that when using the preset modes, every picture Ive taken has come out darker than expected. Ive had to go in and adjust the brightness more than with any other camera Ive ever owned. 

I tend to do heavy photo editing, so that was not a big deal for me considering I normally crop, adjust tones and saturation, add text, add frames, and often convert to black and white or sepia. I have not experimented yet with manual modes, and probably wont due to the fact that my husband and daughter will be the primary users. 

This camera comes with no internal memory at all, which I found to be a downside. A 32 MB SD card was included which holds a couple dozen photos, so youll want to order a higher capacity one with this camera. I bought the Transcend 4 GB SDHC SD Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS4GSDHC6E [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging] and it can hold over 1000 photos taken at full resolution. 

The battery life is excellent on this camera. Ive already taken 150+ photos with the children and the batteries have not yet run out. 

What most impresses me with this camera is one of the few point and shoot digital cameras that can accept a wide angle or telephoto lens. I plan to order the wide angle lens and put it into my daughters stocking. (Just search Amazon for a590is lens and several options will show up.)</Content>

Although it has an ¨Auto mode¨ I prefer to use it in the ¨Program mode¨ which lets me modify the settings according to my personal needs and it works fine! I am thinking in getting in the future the cannon G10 for more serious shots.

Pics are clear and crisp. The zoom is good for the 4x to get better youll probably have to go up to a bigger camera. This one is small but not tiny so my husband can hold and use just as easily. But it still can fit in my purse. I would recommend this to anyone and I havent even tried all the modes yet. Cant wait to try the continuos shooting mode at my cousins next rodeo. </Content>

<Content>This camera takes excellent pictures but there is one caution about using it. Do not power on the camera when anything can stop the lens from extending. This will strip the gears and you might start getting the a message that the camera must be restarted. It eventually can cause the camera to not operate at all. Best advice is to leave the camera in the review mode. That way if it is in your pocket or purse and does get accidently turned on, the lens will not try to extend. </Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera after a long review and shopping process.  It takes terrific photos and the set-up settings are quick and easy.  I can change from landscapes to portraits to movies quickly with a little twist of the knob.  I wanted something compact but also something that I could grip easily.
There are only 2 things I am not pleased with.
  1. The little plastic cover for uploading doesnt easily open and I cant seem to get it to open all the way.  I have to kind of work the connection under and into the slot.  I feel eventually it will break.  This could use a redesign.
  2. The hand strap provided is pretty big and I am a big guy.  I find it difficult putting my hand in and then wrapping my hand around to hold the camera.  A little cinching clamp would be nice because I could then just let it hang from my wrist.  Absolutely cannot do this now.

Other than that, great product and a great price.  Best Buy was $40 more. </Content>

<Content>I had a long-time digital camera fail me and I reviewed available ones in Consumer Reports to find that this one was recommended.  It was just right for me in many respects.  I like to take candid shots and really dont like a camera to take too long to come on or have too much of delay in actually taking the picture.  I have been impressed with the improvement from my 5 year old digital camera.  The pictures are simply excellent.  The image stabilization lets me zoom in and shoot without flash.  The shutter speed is reduced, of course, and I often have to take few shots to get a no blur picture due to subject movement, but Ive seen very little evidence of problems with hand shake.  I really like this camera.</Content>

The batteries that came with the camera lasted maybe 1-2 days (of not heavy use), canon rechargeable batteries lasted about the same, then new batteries lasted long enough to open the shutter and then failed!
We have returned the camera and are ordering a new one - hopefully this will be better.

The Sony Cybershot took great pictures and the Canon Powershot matches up pretty well but you need to know the ins and outs of the manual settings  in order to take non-blury pictures without using the auto features.
For its price this is a nice deal and a sharp looking camera.
Pictures look better once downloaded or printed...the view screen does not do them a great justice.I have not yet learned all of this cameras features and best photo taking options(given the circumstances). </Content>

<Content>I looked for a new digital camera for quite awhile.  Finally decided on either a Cannon, Nikon, or Sony.  Amazon had this camera on a particularly good sale at just under $100.00.  I jumped at it.  The two models I had been looking at in the Cannon line was this Powershot A590 IS and the 110SX.  The price convinced me this was the one for me and Im very glad I did.  Ive not had the time necessary to use all of its features but the ones I have are very,very good.  In AUTO mode itl do most everything the average picture taker needs done and does it well.  Im not anywhere close to a professional photographer, at one time I did have a small business taking photos, using hand models, and made quite a name for myself, but, that was in the years of 35mm and the myriad equiptment list.  Ive dropped the camera bug for the motorsports bug that I made a bit of money photographing, and love the way this camera responds to all the shooting situations I come into now.  I can even use it at speed on the track, without anybody else near anyway.  It is that easy to use.  Im impressed with the results Ive gotten so far and will continue to delve into the features of this very good, small, lightweight, point-and-shoot.  The results are far better than most other point-and-shoots that Ive seen in this same megapixel range.  I understand its the size of the sensor, and not just how many pixels it senses, and the sensor in this camera is bigger than most others.  I LIKE IT ! </Content>

<Content>I do documentation fieldwork, so I wanted an inexpensive backup camera in case of any problem with my Panasonic TZ5. I chose the Canon a590 because of the great reviews, and because I had been impressed by the performance of my parents Canon a570. 

I hate to say it, but Im happier with the Canon a590 than with my Panasonic TZ5. I particularly like the manual controls on the Canon, and the possibility to set the flash strength. It looks like Ill use the Canon as my primary camera, and keep the Panasonic TZ5 as a backup in case I damage or lose the Canon.

I bought the Canon a590 for $119 on-line from Best Buy, and it included a 2 GB SD memory card. I bought Radio Shacks NiMH rechargable AA batteries, which are the best rechargable batteries Ive ever used.

I highly recommend the Canon a590. </Content>

<Content>This was just reviewed in the Seattle Times as one of the best digital camera bargains for Xmas 2008. As they pointed out it is a bit larger than the credit card cameras you can pack in your pocket, but since I was looking for something to take stills with in my studio, it has turned out to be an excellent buy.

It does eat AA batteries, about one hour of work per set, but rechargeables solve that problem. The interface is very intuitive and the included sw has an excellent GUI. The auto mode, macro setting and delayed shutter are outsanding features.</Content>

<Content>Very nice camera for the price, with satisfatory set of manual controls. I had a double priced a610 before, wich is better than a590 because of the foldable display, the video fps rate (30 for a610 and 20 for a590) and minimum macro focus (1cm for a610 and 5cm for a590), and yet I feel very happy with my budget a590.</Content>

It takes very clear pics, but with minimal light, it tends to have difficulty capturing.  Very good value and quality.  The only con is its size.  Its slightly thick and the area housing the batteries sticks out, making it not too pocket friendly.</Content>

<Content>I researched quite a few cameras before purchasing this one through Amazon.  It takes great pictures, navigation and understanding the camera is a breeze, i particularly like the view playback feature, allowing you to view pictures without opening the lens.  Its super easy to zoom in on faces and items of interest, check for closed eyes,etc.  Just quickly erase and snap again!  I think for the money I made a good decision with this camera.  Even during the competitive holiday season and price wars, the price I paid for the camera was well below everyones price.  It was shipped securely and arrived very timely.  I wanted something with a little bulk in my hand, i have had a couple small point and shoot cameras and their size lends to putting in your pocket or sliding in the purse.  With this camera I want and have to use a camera bag to keep it safe.   I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants to take quality photos with no hassle.  </Content>

<Content>i bought this camera after seeing a piece on dpreview.com comparing 9 budget cameras.  this one had the best overall image quality in the tests.

it really is amazing what $120 can buy you these days.  photography enthusiasts on a budget will love the features. the camera has fully manual capability and a really nice layout and menu design.  it shows you the shutter and aperture settings its using when you depress the shutter.  in program mode you can just shoot, or you can adjust exposure, ISO, white balance, flash exposure as you like.  its clearly produced by a company thats always refining its products to be more flexible without being unecessarily complicated.

the camera is well designed and responsive.    if it could only shoot raw and had live histogram id give it an A+ for features.

the bad news is its still a cheap camera.   the sensor is small and fairly noisy.  frankly im a bit disappointed in that regard.  the pictures look good in general terms but when you zoom in to 100% they are noisy and compressed looking in general, with high ISO pictures being really bad  (mind you i usually shoot RAW images with a larger camera).

the only consolation is knowing that other cameras at this price are the same if not worse.  but you really dont want to shoot in low light with this thing, it looks like a damn snowstorm.

if your camera budget is $150, i absolutely recommend this camera.  if image quality is important and you can spend more, its may be worth it to do so... but you may have to spend considerably more to see any improvement.</Content>

<Content>On the advice of the MIS Honcho at work, because hes so smart most people dont understand what hes saying half the time even though hes speaking English, I decided to abandon my Nikon Coolpix 2100, 2.0 megapixel camera in favor of this model. The spotlight review pushed me over the edge too, and unlike him, I know next to nothing more complicated than a P-38 can opener. (See my review.)

This camera comes with a 79-page software starter guide. (If you go beyond that it will be upside down and in Spanish.) Like a car owners manual, it will be in my drawer for the next several years, largely unread. It also comes with a 199-page user guide, which like my car owners manual will be in my drawer for the next several years, largely unread. There is another one that says Guia del usuario del la camera. (I might have a harder time with that one--that is 208 pages.) There is a solution disk. (That word sounds hopeful.) There are two, AA batteries and a puny 32 mb memory card included that might see me through Christmas Day, but I wont take the chance. (Ill replace that with a 4 GB card from Kingston at $8.99 including shipping.) Besides cables whose use I understand about as much as I would a Hindu chant, it comes with a neat little neck strap which I am sure to lose in record time.

I ordered this yesterday, regular shipping, through J  R World where smart New Yorkers shop, which might explain why I got it here today, or just because I live in the same city. Its one of the many discount stores that seems to survive when others go under, and the price was $100 less than the ancient Nikon I thought was such a deal five years ago.

I usually think of products like these using a Blanchard/Hersey Leadership Model. S1 is Ho-No; S2 is Ho-Hum; S3 is Ho-Kay, and S4 is Ho-Ho. This is very Ho-Ho, which is also appropriate for the season. I will try and take a picture of my Christmas tree with it, and post it, before my great nephews and great niece destroy it this Sunday.

Floyd also advised me to spend even more money on better batteries and a recharger that tells you when your batteries are fully charged, and stops charging them, thus saving battery life. (Put a suction attachment to my pockets, will ya?!)

I will add more to this review as time and experience permits.

Merry Christmas!

<Content>For me... it was between the 590is(8MP) and the Sony Cybershot DSC-W170(10MP) , But after test using the two brands, the 590is just dominated, with the quality, options, and price. Also you cant zoom in-and-out on the Sony while recording video, a key option for me. Its a great starter camera, very pro-like and easy to use. I bought the 590is, a Canon tripod, and 8 gigs of memory, and STILL! had $60 left over. </Content>

<Content>If youre looking for a sturdy and good quality camera at a competitively low price, youre not gonna get much better than this.

Ive been into amateur photography for a while, so Ive been a great fan of pointshoot cameras such as the Sony Cybershot (For 3 years) and now my four month old Canon Powershot A590IS camera. From the description and price of the product alone, I felt compelled to purchase the PowerShot almost instantly. However being a person who always looks for the best deal, I window-shopped around for a while. As you can guess I eventually made the purchase and can say I am very content with the camera.

Being an amateur at photography, I havent been too good at getting live-action shots, so the Image Stabilization was good catch for me. However after extensive use of the camera, I must say that and the night scene/portrait shots are the two features I have been fairly disappointed with.

The detail of most shots is superb, but that one particular core feature (image stabilization) is nothing above or less than mediocre.

So out for a rating out of 5:
Overall Performance = 4     
Ease of Use = 5</Content>

I shoot candid shots in group settings and wanted a camera with a viewfinder that responded quickly when the shutter is pushed and used AA batteries. This does far more than I can do and is perfect for what I use it for.</Content>

<Content>I have the previous model, the A-570, but with IS also (image stabilization).  It means the ability to shoot 2-3 shutter speeds slower (a photo shot at 1/15th will usually look just as sharp as a shutter speed of 1/120, a huge factor in composition). Canon does the best IS in the business.

One other wonderful thing about these cameras is that people have figured out how to hack the firmware. Dont worry, it wont break anything, and the new firmware sits on the SD card; remove the card, and the camera reverts back to factory stock. Just Google canon a580 firmware.

I use the new firmware to tell the camera to automatically take three photos in a sequence, with one 2 stops down, one on the money, and one 2 stops up. Using commonly-available software, you get some remarkable results--just like the uber-expensive Canon and Nikon bodies deliver.</Content>

<Content>This was purchased for my wife as a walk around kind of camera.  She uses a Nikon D70 for her real photography, but needed something for family activities or driving around.  So far, she has been thrilled with this camera.  The size of the camera is great.  The extra area on the right side allows for a great grip and stability.  She loves that she can hold it facing her to take photos with her and the kids.

PROS:  Ergonomics, ease of use, video feature was an unexpected bonus that she uses all the time.

CONS:  Battery life (caveat:  weve been using generic, non-rechargeable.  Were currently looking for good rechargeables.)  While there is a Macro feature, my wife finds it somewhat unsatisfactory as there is bending around the edge of the image.  It is small and not something I would have ever noticed if she had not pointed it out.

Overall, we are both greatly satisfied with this camera and would recommend it to anyone (and do!!!)</Content>

I was debating whether to spend more to get the highest pixels or go with the Canon A590IS with 8MP.  I decided budget wise to go with the A590IS.  Boy was I glad I did...this is a great camera!  The pictures are so clear and there are so many options on this camera if you want to be creative and change how your shots come out.

<Content>I tried a few other cameras (some bought and returned in the same day) in a quest to find an inexpensive backup for our primary Canon point and shoot.  Based on ratings and my own experience with Canon cameras, I ordered this camera from Amazon without trying one.  As I expected, this is a great unit for the money.  

The picture quality in indoor light conditions is much better than other brand cameras I tried in this price range.  Also, the canon cameras seem to do very well taking video clips at normal indoor light levels - definitely note the case on some others I tried.  

I would recommend this camera as a strong performing inexpensive unit.  </Content>

<Content>The camera body is plastic but it is substantial and feels solid.  Be sure to get 2500 NiMH batteries as they will last the longest.  The manual says you should get approximately 450 shots with a fresh set of NiMH, 2500mAH batteries and approximately 200 shots with regular Alkaline batteries. The batteries are quick to change and a separate coin battery in the camera keeps the date/time and other settings from falling out so you are up and running in no time.  Some reviews have said you cant zoom when shooting video but that is not the case. Granted, you wont have the digital zoom capability, but that has not been an issue for me.

I like this camera and Im pleased at how it works a feels.  For the price, it is, by far the best deal out there.</Content>

<Content>I got this camera after having a poor experience with another brand (casio) small point and shoot camera. The Canon A590IS provides excellent quality photos and video both indoors and out. I used it for an entire weeks vacation in a a variety of settings with an 8GB SDHC card with no problems. The image stabilization is a huge plus for this camera, because the small point and shoots without it often result in blurry pictures, even in good lighting. This canon is easy to grip and take a nice steady picture. The result is you can usually get a good shot even with the flash off in normal room lighting, because the stablization keeps the shot steady during a slower shutter speed.

I used all the various automatic modes like indoor, kids, pets, landscape etc with good results, but auto and P mode seem to do the job in most situations. The video results are very good, even though they are only 20 fps, but this only effects fast action like a sports event, and even then is not really noticeable. I made a video of a flag football game that came out fine. I tested all the modes up to 8 megapixel. The 3M fine mode is my default for normal situations.

The only downside of this camera is the battery life. For some reason, the camera shows the AA batteries are low even though they are only slightly discharged. As a result you have to often change the batteries, even though the batteries you take out still measure well into the green charged range on a battery tester. So do not throw away batteries after you take them out of this canon. They are still fine for any other device. Canon needs to fix this problem.

Otherwise great camera at a great price for both photo and video. Get an 8GB SDHC card and a bunch of AA batteries and you will be good to go.</Content>

<Content>This is my first digital camera and I was concerned that it would take forever to figure out all the special features.  The user guide is 207 pages!  I ended up just reading the first few pages so that I could get started using the camera right away.  I then discovered that many of the features are self-explanatory.  Anyway, I have yet to read the guide or watch the video but have been using the camera almost daily for 2 months. 
I love the quality of the pictures and unlike a 35mm, good light is not that important.  I take a lot of pictures inside with pretty lousy light.  The memory card that comes with the camera will let you take about 12 pictures but it only takes a minute to download the pictures onto your computer and clear the card.  I am going to get the 1 GB memory card and camera case that Amazon offers, they are only $15.95.  I have noticed that this camera burns through double A batteries pretty quick but it only takes two double As. I ignore the low battery warning and keep going until the batteries are completely used up, this lets me get another couple days of use.  Anyway, I love this camera!  If you need a good camera for your Ebay pictures, this one is great!</Content>

<Content>I searched and searched read review after review and finally and ended up with the Canon A590IS. I have only had the camera a short period and am absolutely overjoyed with my choice. Picture quality is excellent. Full control of the camera, anywhere from automatic or easy mode for my wife, or for my pleasure, lots of presets and actual manual mode and lets not forget the image stabiliztion. When you run out of things to play with there are extra lens available to give you a little more. My wife wanted a simple point and shoot, she just wants to take a picture by pressing a button. She loves it. I on the other hand, like to learn and enjoy the process of discovery. I love it. This camera will give way above average photos regardless if a begginer, seasoned photographer or anythng in between. Price is great delivery on time and in perfect condition. Too bad I can only give five stars. By all means buy it enjoy it and remember canons quality and excellent tech support</Content>

<Content>The A590IS is probably the best camera bargain out there now. Its amazing how much camera you can get for the money nowadays, compared to just a few years ago. The A590IS is a decent performer. Its performs much better in good lighting conditions, than low light. Pictures are quite noisy, but usable at ISO higher than 200. The flash is weak, but OK for most situations. Recycle time is also slow. The camera has a view finder, but its pretty much useless since its tiny and very inaccurate. The 2.5 115k low resolution LCD screen is where you can tell this is a budget camera. It does its job, but is fair at best. The video mode is limited. You cant zoom during recording, and fps has been limited to 20fps. On the positive side, battery life seems improved over previous A models. There are some manual modes. This is very uncommon on inexpensive cameras. The camera is fairly small, stylish, and generally takes very good pictures. All in all, it would be tough to find a better camera in this price range. The Panasonic Lumix LZ8 is probably its closest competition.</Content>

<Content>Pricing on this camera is all over the board. At $105-$110 including shipping it is a great bargain. Some pictures come out great. Sometimes the camera fails to focus properly resulting in blurry pictures. I have not figured this one out yet. I take as many shots of a scene as I can and hope there is a good one in the bunch. There is also significant barrel distortion at the wide end of focus. Battery life has been good on mine using Energizer 2500mAh NMH batteries. I like the lighter weight of two batteries instead of four like my A85 uses. I have to crank up the custom color settings to avoid washed out colors. Noise has not been a problem for me so far. Do all cameras in this price range produce pictures which require touching up? This is good and bad news. Pictures usually require a little sharpening and some contrast adjustment and these pictures respond well to the adjustments. However, 90% of the pictures require this fiddling. IS is a marvel compared with the A85. Good camera for casual use, or one step above with experimentation. I am still learning. </Content>

<Content>I recieved this camara 3 days after I bought it so the shipper was very quick and on top of it.  I am giving this camara as a present so I havent had much time to play with it, but from what I have experenced its a really great camara. It dosent take forever for the camara to take pics and has about every option on it as a professional one from what I can tell. The only con is that is a little more bulky then what I thought it would be, so dosent fit in your pocket very well but still a great buy!</Content>

<Content>I was looking for a solid, dependable point  shoot upgrade from my previous 8 MP digital camera, which blurred my shots too often. I need a camera that is easy to use, and takes good photos suitable for printing, thus the 8 MP minimum requirement. The A590IS turned out to be my choice for several reasons. The Canon reputation, Price, and available add-ons. This camera is selling for $185.00 at our local WalMart in Erie, Pennsylvania. One thing to note is the two Opteka lens made for this model, and sold here at Amazon.con. One Telephoto, and the other a wide angle lens. So if I decide one day to become more involved with photography, I can make some very inexpensive upgrades to this camera. Did I mention this camera has an EASY setting ? Yes ! When I dont have the time to show friends or family, that wants to use it, the features of this camera, I just set it to easy and hand it to them. The anti shake, image stabilization works great too. There are so many features on this camera, Im still amazed at the price, and its been lowered even more since my purchase in October 08. It fits my hands nicely, as its not too small, but much smaller than a digital SLR. I also bought the PSC-85 Deluxe Case and its perfect match for this model even though the case is not advertised to fit this model. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great point  shoot, at a great price.</Content>

<Content>I bought two of these as gifts.  One for a daughter and another for my son.  This model of camera has received great acclaim from both magizine reviewers (PC World) and consumer buyers.  That and a long standing good reputation of the Canon brand decided the purchase.  As these are both Christmas gifts, the actual users of these cameras dont even have them out of the box yet.  Based upon their actual use and experience of this camera later on, Ill add to or amend this review accordingly.</Content>

<Content>Ive been a fan of Canon cameras for years now...Ive owned the A40, A60, SD630 and my current camera is the SD870IS and I have loved each and every one of them. This A590IS was a birthday present for my elderly father and would be his first digital camera. I didnt want to spend too much or get a camera that was too tiny or packed with features he would never use. I knew that the shape of this camera (because of AA batteries) would be easier to hold than my tiny SD Eplhs (it is) yet still provide a more than adequate point and shoot when set to auto. Another thing about this camera that I liked is the viewfinder which makes a nice transition for someone who is not used to digicams with lcd screens on the back. The image stabilization (IS) is also worth its weight in gold when you consider that older digital cameras had to be held absolutely still to get a good picture without blurring. My dad loves this camera..he has already stopped using the viewfinder (which is barely adequate imo)and bought rechargeable AA batteries and a nice case for it. This camera makes a perfect entry level digicam but is still packed with features when you feel comfotable trying them out.

Pros:
Small and light without being too tiny
Takes very good pics even on auto
Packed with features
The price is right

cons:
viewfinder is too small and not accurate
Shape makes it not as pocketable as the SD series

<Content>I purchased it to replace my Nikon 850. I use the camera to record family events, indoor activities, and sometimes snapshots of cityscapes, nothing special. I just needed something smaller, lighter, and faster than my previous camera. I like the image stabilization and face recognition features. The batteries (came with the camera) have a longer life than my other camera and the time it takes to recharge between one picture and the next is very short (even using flash). Before I purchased this camera I read reviews and followed the advise to purchase a 4Gb card and extra batteries and charger. Im using the 4G card. I have not had the need to use the other batteries yet.  Im still discovering and testing the features in this camera. So far, very happy with it. </Content>

<Content>The A590IS adds an easy shooting mode but takes away the stitch assist mode though it comes with the software.  Also movie mode goes down to 20 frames/sec vs. 30 on a570 when shooting VGA (640x480). Buttons on A590 changed - they look good - but are kind of trigger happy. Also re-designed case on A590 and the placement of the tripod hole makes it hard to level camera. (not a problem with a570) A570 takes 6-7 seconds to recycle the flash (not sure about A590 which does have better resolution on portraits). Opening and closing the battery door seems very hard on both - until you discover the right way of doing it!</Content>

<Content>In looking for a point and shoot for my aged mother who is very anxious to embrace digital photography, I was naturally drawn to this camera based upon its popularity and reviews. Heres the catch - the ergonomics of this camera, while OK, are not suited by any stretch to those who may be challenged with even the slightest hand/finger challenges. This applies pretty much across the board to most point and shoot cameras, and smallish electronics - theyre just not comfortable unless youve got young nimble hands. Why cant these manufacturers take into account those who are a bit physically challenged as well? Its because they design in vacuums - I challenge them to put on a pair of lightweight gloves, then design. At least that will give some perspective.</Content>

<Content>This is my first digital camera and I am not sorry for the purchase.  There are SO many features that Im still using the default selections except that I did select the highest quality for the photos and it takes EXCELLENT photos!

I purchased a 4gb 133x card as the included 32mb would have only held about a dozen high quality images and theres no way it could have held the videos Ive been taking.  The fact it only comes with a 32mb standard card is no by no means any fault of the camera so no points lost there as some other cameras dont come with a card at all Ive discovered in my search.

The fact that the camera came with extra goodies like the cables that some other brands try to sell you separately spoke good of Canon and it even came with good AA batteries, though I suspect Ill be replacing the next set with some Energizer Lithium AAs.

And a hint to any other new users: leave the display screen protector on and dont worry about finger smudges or scratches.  :-)  They sell those things all over Amazon and other stores but the camera comes with one in place and I have to wonder how many people throw them away only to buy one again later.  :-)

<Content>Because I am a professional photographer, I know people like reading reviews they can understand. Im going to make this as simple as can be...the Canon Powershot A560, in my opinion, is probably the best digital camera anyone could get. Thats if youre a normal person that wants a really good digital camera. Professionals should stick to some of Canons higher lever cameras that are more sophisticated. I say that the A560 is the best for many reasons. For one, its price is as reasonable as can get. Another reason the A560 is the best is that I have probably dropped mine like 10 times already and the only harm the camera got was a few scratches here or there. Now a digital camera with this kind of durability is awesome. Other digital cameras end up being ruined after a couple of drops. First, a feature or two stops working. Before you know it, all your pictures are gone and the camera is busted. Hectic, isnt it? So, if youre hesitant in buying the Canon A560, YOU HAVE NO REASON TO BE! Go ahead and buy it, Im sure you wont regret it!</Content>

<Content>This is a nice camera, especially for the price.  It does everything that I need it to do:  auto focus/flash, zoom...It uses AA batteries which is a plus in my book because I dont like having to recharge batteries (or buy replacement rechargables).  Since AA batteries are available everywhere, I never have to worry about battery levels.  Cameras that use AAs are usually a little larger than those with the small rechargable batteries, but it is worth a little extra bulk in my opinion.  I bought a large memory card for it so I can take hundreds of photos.  
I highly recommend this camera!</Content>

<Content>This camera caught my eye as a great replacement for my aging Canon PS A80.
My main concerns were battery life and durability.  The A80 uses four AAs and good battery life and has stood the test of time. The A590IS uses only two AAs which makes it a little bit smaller, which makes it more pocketable, and with the newer battery technologies is very acceptable as far as battery life. 
The A80 takes great pictures with a mere 4meg pix so the upgrade to 8 was not a selling point.  The 590 does have a little bit better video capability which was a selling point.....and the recent low price definately sealed the deal.
At any rate this is a great little camera and should please most newbies and the majority of older Canon PowerShot owners.</Content>

<Content>I first purchased a blue Kodak EasyShare M863 8.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Red) and hated it.  The pics taken outside were horrible.  I returned it and bought this.  It takes nice pics, both inside and out.  Easy to use.  Battery life has been fine as well.

The only problem I found so far has been that the automatic setting does not take decent pics of children who are active.  So, I have to put it on the children setting.  Which is not a big deal to me.  If you are looking to keep it on one setting all the time and not worry about it, then I suggest looking for another make/model.

<Content>I love this camera.  Im just a point and shooter but am having a great time learning how to use the more advanced features that this camera has to offer.

It takes great pics with the auto setting but I have been using the P program mode with the my colors set to vivid to get great pics of the fall foliage.

The video feature also works great and records sound as well.

You can spend thousands on a digicam but for the casual photographer like myself, this camera rocks.  And at a price almost anyone can afford.

Oh yea, the macro feature on this camera is fun to play with getting great close up pics of things like flowers, close ups of abes face on a five dollar bill, etc.....

The 32 MB card that comes with the camera can only take 8 pics at the highest resolution, so make sure you get at least a 1 gig card.  The price of the SDHC (high capacity) cards at Amazon were so inexpensive that I bought a 4 gig Sandisk Ultra II card for an extra[...]

I also bought the genuine Canon carrying case for another [...].  It has a belt loop which makes it easy to carry around.

For the money, the Canon A590is is an awesome value.  Highly recommended.

<Content>I honestly really enjoy the Powershot A590IS. Although its not a high-quality SLR, its an awesome point-and-shoot with a ton of great manual features. I would highly recommend this for someone who is looking for a quality camera for everyday use. 

Its light and relatively small. I do however, like the way it fits in your hand. It makes it easy to take one-handed photos. The features I like most about this camera, are the manual functions. I have an OK amount of photography knowledge and being able to adjust the aperture, shutter speed and flash is impressive. The Macro setting surprisingly takes very good quality close-up images. 

You can also buy HD and wide-angle lenses for this camera, which ranks it above most point-and-shoot cameras. This is a great product, I would definitely recommend it! </Content>

<Content>This is one great little camera! It works as advertised. Great looking pictures. Lots of nice features. I got the camera a few days ago, and I have been able to take very nice photos. Does not require a lot of knowledge of photography. The only complain, so far, would be that it doesnt come with a carrying case. I wish Canon could include a carrying case for this little powerful camera to protect it on the go. Other than that, so far, so good. The camera works as it should. So if you need a little camera that is also full of features and takes great pictures, the A590 should be on top of your list. Get it with the Kingston 4GB SDHC card and you too will have nice things to say about this nice little performer. </Content>

<Content>Im a casual camera user-- almost never tweak settings like a knowledgeable photographer.  Ive owned about five digital cameras before the Canon PowerShot A590 IS, and Im stunned at the difference.  This little camera is a revelation for me.  Its like the leap from a disposable to a 35mm SLR.  The clarity and color are great, and probably most importantly, the image-stabilization reverses my good photo ratio.  Know what I mean?  With previous cameras, perhaps 20% of them were sharp enough to really use.  With this one, at least 80% of them are.  In fact, after having taken only a few dozen photos, Im over 90%.  In low light and with moving images or a moving/shaking camera, you cant beat this for value and performance.

As of November 2008, I cannot recommend any camera without optical (NOT digital!) image stabilization.  Canon has been doing IS for years (I have a pair of their IS-empowered binoculars-- also great!), and for the current price of $110, this thing is amazing.

Good luck!  But whatever you do, get optical IS!!!</Content>

<Content>I have bought several Canon Powershot cameras over the years, going way back to 35 mm film.  The digital cameras are completely user friendly, moderately priced and give you great pictures.  I usually wait until the prices come down (after a new model is introduced - maybe the next year or so).  The A590IS uses 2 AA batteries (no need to worry about rechargeables - just throw away the used ones, put in GOOD quality batteries, and start clicking).  I also bought an inexpensive data card (4 GB)and dont expect to fill it up.  I usually download and delete anyway.  This camera is a good deal for the novice as well as the more experienced.  I always carry it in my car or motorcycle, ready for the photo ops.</Content>

<Content>got this camera for days when I dont want to haul around my quite large 40D/17-55mm f2.8 outfit, and for air travel. The 590IS was very nice surprise; the images are decent considering negligible camera weight and size, IS functions well, but most importantly, the manual controls are well laid out and easy to access. I generally adjust exposures by at least -1/3 stop for better highlights, and such exposure compensation as well as manual flash on/off etc is right at your fingertips. I was worried that AA batteries will go too fast, but no, the power consumption is not too bad either. I still bought rechargables though. Im going to buy one more 590IS, left my original one at different location for use there. I bought more luxurious/more expensive 1100IS for my wife some time ago, and in my opinion the 590IS is much better overall.</Content>

<Content>This is an excellent small digital point and shoot camera with a good zoom. It fits easily in a pocket or purse, produces sharp images and handles a wide range of lighting conditions well. It is great for grab shots even when you or the or the object of photography is moving. The image stabilizer really works! My only complaints are that the two AA batteries are used up rapidly and that the cover of the battery compartment can be difficult to close properly. Since with heavy use, batteries must be changed fairly often, the latter can be irritating and also can result in the camera not operating until the cover is reopened and reclosed.</Content>

<Content>I have had this camera for a few months now. It take good pictures but the big problem is battery life. You can only get 1 day for shooting before you need new batteries. I think it is because it has such a large LCD. Make sure you always have an extra set of AAs with you. Also it does not have the panaramic mode that the 570 and all previous models have so if you want his get the Canon 570.</Content>

<Content>I received this camera today. I have not had a chance to use it yet as the rapid battery charger redc light has been on red all day. I have recently read this is a a very low rated battery charger. I highly recommend you do not buy the battery charger ( fofr half price, but worth nothing) offered with the purchase of the camera, a lot of problems with batteries running too low way too soon, also not charging right in the first place. Its a hassle. I do not know why Canon allowed Amazon to sell this Canon camera with a deal of a lousy half off battery charger that I will have to return as you never know when or whether  the batterie are charged at all or if they are going to work one hour or many hours. Further, the camera is $4 cheapter than it was a few days ago. I wonder why. For a high rated camera on the internet, I am very disappointed. </Content>

I bought this when the price was $200 and now that its only like $120 its an even better deal. Picture quality is the best thing by far but the thing that sets it apart is the features that allows you change many aspects of the shot. Im not a professional and need the camera only for fun but found the features nice to just play around with... Great buy overall. Plus Canon is known for its cameras.</Content>

<Content>As a casual photo taker, I am after an affordable and reliable camera for everyday use. The first DC I brought was a Pentax Optio 230 back in 2002. It was a 2MP camera but cause me A$566 (about US$400)! It served me well, the outdoor pictures with a lot of light is quite good and it still works okay for occasional family shots. 6 year down the track I think it is time to upgrade to newer technology. I brought the Canon A590IS based on its good review in Amazon and I like the feature set on spec. I brought it at a local camera shop at A$163 a couple of months ago and it came with Canons leather case and photo printing voucher. 

I would not hesitate to recommend it to others. The good points about the camera are:

Excellent pictures with ease mode especially outdoor and not bad for indoor under normal lighting. A bit noisy for indoor when the lighting is dim, better use the flash to compensate.

If you have time, the manual controls are great and let you create your own effects. The Canon Browser record all the camera parameters for each photo which is great for budding photograher. Despite some reviews caution against poor battery life, I was pleased with what I can get from a pair of 2650 mAH NiMH rechargables, I used it for over 200 photos before feeling the need  recharging. 

The only down side for the camera, is its physical size, its not a camera you can put in your shirt pocket. The original Canon leather case is great, you can wear it in your belt. 

Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.

<Content>I read a lot of reviews while selecting this camera.  Kudos to RLSd, F. Gillett,  Molly P., among others.  Forget the stars - it was their accurate realistic detail that really helped.  Lacking their expertise, Ill confine myself to a few areas that concerned me until I actually used the A590IS.  This was partly due to other reviews that werent as well done.

First is the size and chunkiness issue.  Its chunkier than some of its peers, but only a bit.  It slides into a jacket or jeans pocket very nicely.  In exchange for the chunkiness you get a camera you can grip securely and hold steady.  You also get a shape you are far less likely to drop, even holding it in one hand while scrambling over the rocks.  Finally, you get a view finder, not just a screen.  During a recent two weeks in Greece, that was a Godsend, as the bright Aegean sun totally wiped out the electronic image.

Second there is the battery issue.  I read complaints from folks who said the camera ate batteries and died after too few shots.  Im not sure what was going on there, but you need to research the batteries the way you did your camera.  The new Energizer lithium batteries got off about 400 shots, half with flash, before I had to replace them.  And because it was a new toy, I was constantly using the camera to show my shots to my wife, which burned still more power.  Hard to beat that.  Are they the right choice for everyone?  Maybe not.  They are not rechargeable, so theres an ecological price to pay.  Around the house I may switch to something greener, but for overseas trips, Ill stick with them.

Another issue is the lag time between flash shots.  Lets be real.  If you want instant turn-around time, you shouldnt be looking at a $130 camera that uses a pair of AAs.  If you want a camera for fast-breaking sports and photo-journalism, dont get an A590IS. That said, I didnt think it took insufferably long.  I cant think of any shots I failed to get due to recycle time.

Some folks had tales of woe about taking all these wonderful shots, only to have them disappear from the chip.  When the camera arrives, read the little book, esp. the part on formatting your chip.  That should prevent such sorrow from striking.

Incidentally, one little discussed but really cool feature is the zoom capability when examining photos already in the can.  You can zoom in to an incredible degree and find things in pix youve already taken that you didnt even know was there.  (Honestly, honey, I had no idea she was topless.)  I was stunned by the clarity.

Do I have any complaints? A few.  The manual is good but it has one of the worst indexes Ive ever seen.  Dont assume it omits a topic just because it isnt in the index.  Flip through the pages and youll find what you need.  On occasion, I was disappointed in the inability of the camera to handle sharp lighting contrasts.  Granted, Greek sunlight and shadow can create some extreme challenges, but its still a limiting factor.  The flash is useful but dont ask too much of it.  You have to be quite close to your subject, esp. at night.  If you are outdoors, its easy to be too far away without realizing it.

I guess thats about it.  My bottom line is that I love this camera and Im pleased and amazed with the shots I brought back from my recent trip.  Its a great transitional camera for someone like myself who finally decided to leave his old 35mm gear and give in to digital.  The auto setting is really good, but it permits manual control as well.  Am still experimenting with that but am encouraged by what I see.  I would buy this camera again in a heartbeat.

<Content>My wife and I like this camera so much we now have two of them.
I bought this camera for my wife because it has an easy setting. The easy setting is the ideal point and shoot that eliminates the need to set any options and is therefore well suited to anyone who just wants to take pictures. I also bought a 4G SDHC card which allows almost 2K pictures at the highest resolution. My wife is delighted with the camera and has shot a couple of hundred pictures, all on the easy setting (the one with the little red heart). Because of the 8mp resolution I am able to edit and crop the pictures without losing detail. I have played with the camera just enough to learn that the advanced features are very comparable to some of my larger and much more expensives cameras. It wont replace a SLR but it has become our main travel camera because of its small size, it is simple enough to keep my wife happy and complex enough to keep me happy.  We have owned these cameras for several months, taken over 1,000 pictures and they have held up very well.
At the current selling price of these cameras they are a great bargain.
P.S.  I did have a minor problem with one of the cameras that required a return to the Canon service center.  I realize that stuff happens and I wasnt thrilled about having to mail the camera to Canon but their customer service person couldnt have been nicer or more helpful and I had my camera back in a just a few days.  All in all not a bad experience.</Content>

When I was looking for a replacement I chose the A509IS because of my previous experience with Canon. I bought this camera from Amazon for well below what it would have cost locally. The camera is easy to use, lightweight and so far has survived a few drops. The only drawback I have found is the memory provided with it. There are plenty of deals out there for sd cards however and I have added a 4gb card and am still under what other cameras would have cost. I am a long way from being a proffesional photographer but I do take a lot of pictures and would highly reccomend this camera.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera about a week ago from Amazon to take the place of the Fuji Z20fd which only had an LCD screen on it and would black out in the sun.  I have been taking pictures with the Canon, then taking the same picture with the Fuji.  Canon wins hands down.  All the important controls are situated on the back of the camera which you can use without looking at them.  To save battery power you can turn off the LCD screen.  Mostly I shoot in auto mode but have been playing with it in the AE exposure mode which gives me more menu options and color effects. It also has optical image stabilization but doesnt deter from giving an excellent picture.  Colors are true, shadows are grey as they appear in life, not brown which is how the Fuji captured them.  Of course Im more familiar with the Canon since I had a 6 mp one and loved it.  It stays in my purse so Im ready for any shot that comes along.  Thanks to Amazon.</Content>

<Content>I consider myself an intermediate photographer.  Im not a pro but love taking high quality pictures.  So far, my PowerShot A590IS has exceeded my expectations!

Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom

Ive only had my Canon A590IS for a few months, but I love it!  The pictures are great and its easy to use.  To me this seems like a great camera for the price.  Its my first Canon, and its superior to the pocket digitals that Ive owned previously.  

The Canon brand name, the features, and the price sold me on the PowerShot A590IS.  Specifically, I wanted a high-quality name brand camera, relatively small digital camera, for less than $200- that had 8.0 megapixels resolution, a large LCD monitor screen, at least a 4x optical zoom, a viewfinder for sunny days, video with sound capability, that uses SD memory cards.  The A590IS includes all of these, plus some additional features that Im enjoying.  

When you turn the camera sideways for a vertically oriented picture, the camera adjusts so that you dont have to rotate the downloaded images, later.  Also, the processor is the same that Canon uses in their high-end digital SLR professional quality cameras.  Theres also an optical image stabilization feature that reduces the number of blurry images as a result of photographer movement.

[...]My only concern is that the LCD Monitor Screen is virtually flush with (even with) the cameras body, in other words, the screen isnt protected from scratches and damage.  To help protect the LCD monitor screen, Ive added an inexpensive plastic collapsible digital camera LCD monitor shade.  There are numerous brands on the market.  Im using an eFilm DU 2.5-M made by delkin.com.  It cost less than $10-, fits well, gives great shading of the LCD for sunny days outside.  It includes a thin clear plastic screen protector which does not adhere to the LCD monitor screen, but sits about 1/16 above the LCD.  This attached device adds only about 1/4 of thickness to the rear of the camera, when collapsed.  In addition, the LCD Monitor pop-up cover has a quick-removal feature.

I read a good recommendation in another review link regarding Canon cameras.  Thats to store the camera in the picture review mode (used for viewing pictures already taken)as opposed to shoot mode (used for taking still pictures and video).  That way if the power on/off button is accidentally pressed, the lens mechanism wont be activated in a camera case, purse, or pocket--potentially damaging the mechanical optical lens mechanism.  

For me, a service contract makes sense.  In my case I bought my Canon A590IS and 1-year service contract from another online source.  The price now, however, is less at Amazon.com with a 2-year service contract, than I paid, elsewhere.

Im pleased with the image quality, the cameras ease of use, the features, the price, and the look and feel of the A590IS.  Hands down, Im enjoying it more than any camera, digital or film, that Ive owned previously.  I hope others find this review helpful.  </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera about a month ago for my own birthday present.   I love it!  I live in Southern California where the fires were.  I used this instead of my big Canon 20D (which I also love) and took many photos so my arm didnt hurt.  I was traveling so I take them from my car.  One of the photos I took has won the award as the BEST of October 2008 photos with over 3,000 votes in just one week.  You can see it at LA Times.com and click on the My Photos section down at the bottom,and click on BEST OF.  It is a photo of the sun (as I call it Son) big and orange with interesting rings around it.  I also got a great price on this camera too, so I am one happy A plus, statisfied customer!  Thank you Amazon!!!  </Content>

<Content>Still taking some time getting used to this camera, but it is handy and easy to use.  Cannot back light the picture in Auto setting and constantly changing settings.  Not for the professional photographer, but a good point and shoot. I liked it because it still uses conveniently available alkaline or (NI-MH) rechargeable batteries. Zoom and LED are good and its a good value for the price.</Content>

<Content>I have owned 3 digital cameras before buying the Canon PowerShot A590IS. This is hands down the best camera I have ever owned and I have owned 35mm SLR cameras as well. The ease of use, the controls, the features, even the software that came with this camera makes it the best I have ever owned. The picture quality is phenomenal, even when shooting moving people indoors with flash. I take this camera with me everywhere and have taken over 450 pictures within the first 10 days that I have owned it. I am very pleased and would highly recommend this camera.  </Content>

<Content>I have had both the A570is and the A590is. They are nearly identical. I do like the video modes on the A570is and it is curious that Canon reduced the quality and FPS rating on the video. Other than that, they are both superb cameras for the money. As for the flash issue that people keep reporting about. I dont understand how people expect normal cheap alkalines to be adequate. If you want the batteries to last anytime at all and have a reasonable flash recharge you have to have HIGH capacity rechargeable NiMH batteries in the range of 2400mah. If you do that you will find this camera a pleasure. If you try to cheap out and get by on the crummy alkalines from the drugstore this camera is going to be MISERABLE.

Please do yourself a favor and spend about $20 on a nice set of decent high capacity rechargables and a charger and its advisable to have at least four batteries that way you have an extra set of rechargables in your camera bag at all times. I did this on a trip to India with the A570 and with those high capacity batteries and the extra set on hand I never had problems with flash recharge time.

Otherwise, this is an excellent camera. It takes nice, clean pictures most of the time. Of course, it is not up to DSLR levels but I dont expect that. At this price though it really is a superb camera. I like mine alot.</Content>

<Content>Real value for money camera. A light, small compact that gives me some control on exposure when Im too lazy to lug around the DSLR.

Pros
----
1. View finder - saves battery life
2. AA batteries - no extra camera specific charger; easy to find batteries in emergencies
3. quite small - still fits in a jacket/Bermudas pocket 
4. Manual/Av/Tv controls
5. Cheap 

Cons
----
1. Av does not blur background much - since sensor size, distance to lens is different from DSLRs, its effectively like 4 to 5x the aperture value. (ie. at widest of f2.6, its more like f13 or more.... )The background just does not blur out unless its quite far from the subject.
2. 35mm at widest and not 28mm which would be ideal.

<Content>A lot of people have already given good reviews here - its what convinced me to purchase the camera.

However, though I really like the camera, I thought Id point out a couple of areas that i think could be better.

1) The interface/controls/options are many - but pretty complicated for the average user.

2) Not so great in low light, no matter what setting.

3) Would be nice if the lens housing didnt have to extend every time the camera is turned on.

4) Is there a way to turn the flash off by default?  If so, I havent found it.  Im kind of annoyed to have to turn flash off every time I turn the camera on.

5) Contrast seems overly sensitive on this camera.  Bright spots in uneven light tend to be over-exposed.  When the exposure is turned down to compensate, you lose the darker areas altogether.

NOTE: even though I have the above issues, I do like the camera, and I feel it was well worth the $125ish I spent on it.</Content>

<Content>Ill agree with many other reviews here that this is a fantastic little camera. Nice feel, solid construction, takes wonderful pictures. However the time between shots is longer than many other cameras with which I am familiar. The time to cycle between pictures when using the flash is excruciating.

Its also not the smallest camera out there. It fits in a pocket or purse, but just barely.

I recommend this camera and would buy it again as a good value for the price, just dont plan on using it for sports or some other subject where you need to take many shots quickly.</Content>

<Content>We finally replaced our old digital camera (bought in 2002).  It was falling apart, but still worked.

This camera is great.  The picture is great. My old camera took forever to get the shot once the button was pushed.  This one is quick, which is important because I am taking pictures of my kids with it.

It has a lot of features that I am still trying to figure out.  I mostly use the auto feature, and pictures turn out great.  But there are many other setups you can use.  You can even turn it so that you can manually set up the picture.  I dont know anything about manually setting up the picture, but its a fun feature Id like to learn.

For the price, it is a great camera.  </Content>

We dont care if have a zoom read out as with the good sized viewer and active grandchildren, its all we need.  We havent changed batteries in it yet and is used almost every day.  Very easy to operate and download to the computer or printer.  My wife took beautiful flower pictures up close to frame later.  I did purchase the kit for this camera at a very reasonable price.  We havent used the battery charger yet and the carrying case was fine.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for my nine-year-old son about four months ago. He had been playing with my Pentax K10D under careful supervision and had taken some rather striking pictures, so I decided to see if he had any further interest of his own. I didnt want to buy too much camera but at the same time I didnt want to get him a toy that would hamper his ability to take the shots he wanted to take.

I was looking for a camera that had great overall build quality, a usable optical viewfinder, took SD cards (I had a bunch due to my own camera), opened up pretty wide to catch low-light photos, had a reasonable zoom so he could take a variety of shots, was small enough for his hands, light enough for him to carry all day, and enough controls to keep his appetite for the technical side of things sated. This camera was the only one to hit the mark on all specifications.

As an aside, Im likely going to buy him the Opteka wide angle and telephoto adapter lenses. The zoom on this camera is decent, but hes straining against the limit.</Content>

<Content>I use this camera just about everyday, mainly to take pictures of my kids and send to my husband in Iraq and my family out of state.  Ill admit that Im not tech-savvy, so I was hesitant about picking my first digital camera, online no less, and learning how to use it by myself.  The owners manual was very easy to understand.  The camera comes with a 32MB memory card, so I went out and got a 2G one instead (about 500 pictures).  Since Im photographing my kids 99% of the time, I always leave the camera on kids  pets setting, so I cant comment of the other settings (there are several). The pictures turn out clear, even in low lighting.  I can download the pictures easily, edit them as needed and send them to family.  For the price I paid, this is a great camera.  If needed I would buy this camera again.</Content>

<Content>First impression of the camera was very good (speed, sharpness, color rendition), but after short usage period the battery warning light came on.  I started using rechargeable batteries, which I had from my old Cannon 610.  This condition persisted, so I thought possibly new rechargeable batteries were in order.  I bought the highest rated rechargeable NI-MH batteries available.  They are 2700 MAH.  But, after taking 15 pictures and downloading to a PC, the battery light came on and shortly thereafter the camera shut down.  I considered this to be intolerable and sent the camera back. Did I just get a lemon?  In my old Cannon 610, a battery charge lasted forever.

It is exactly what I wanted, small and light with settings that I can just use without having to worry, plus having more options if I want.

The pictures are clear and look wonderful. It is a tremendous value and easily worth the price.  Always make sure to get an extra card and carry some extra batteries just in case you find yourself taking more pictures than you planeed on, which is easy to do because this camera makes it so much fun.</Content>

<Content>This camera is a replacement for a 5 year old Kodak 2.0 megapixel that recently started becoming unreliable.  The controls on the Kodak were few and simple to use and understand.  While the Canon takes wonderful pictures, it has multiple features and controls and a rather difficult-to-understand menu.  If I were a professional photographer I probably could make use of all these things, however, Im just a vacation shooter and am overwhelmed by all the bling.  Thankfully there is an auto mode that can be chosen that turns this equipment into a simple point-and-shoot device.  The instruction manual is fairly easy to understand but some of the symbols used in the menu dont seem to make sense to me.  For example, if you want to turn on the date stamp you have to scroll down to a letter L and then scroll left or right to chose date alone or date and time.  Overall I like the camera and the way it fits my hand.  Its just a little more complicated than what Im used to. </Content>

<Content>Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized ZoomOK, I bought this camera for my wife as a birthday gift. I wanted her to have a camera that was easy to use yet would take decent pictures. Nothing real complicated as she is not real tech savvy. She enjoys taking photos and then doing some minor editing in the camera saving changes and then downloading them to the PC. She can do almost anything she tries to with the Canon PowerShot as the functions on the camera are fairly straightforward to use. The biggest issue we have is with the software. The manual is not helpful and we both find the software confusing and difficult to use on the PC. Were not total novices with camera software as we have HP camera software and use Google Picasa on the PC and we have few issues working with them. I cannot figure how to make an album that I can upload with one click. Well figure it out Im sure but it is a tad frustrating. We would have given 5 stars except for the software as she really likes the camera.</Content>

The Easy mode on the A590 takes all the mystery out of picture taking.  As I get more familiar with the camera, I will use other functions, but already my photos are much better and I have more confidence in using it....PLUS it costs less than the camera it replaces!!</Content>

The only thing I dont like about it is the fact that it doesnt fit in the Aquapac (waterproof bag) camera bag that I bought for it, but I can get a bigger bag, and that problem will be solved!  The pictures are sharp, the modes are great, and I love that the power button and the settings button are two different buttons (unlike my last camera!)  Im by FAR not a professional photographer, but my pictures turned out pertty good, if I do say so myself...  Another feature I like is the audio tag feature. If youre taking a picture of something, and dont think youll remember who or what is in the picture, you can hit a button, and leave a short reminder of whats in the picture!  AMAZING!</Content>

<Content>I would have given this a 5 star rating but, in my opinion, Canons software stinks. Every other digital camera I have had recently ( I have 5) will simply connect via USB and appear as either another hard drive on my system or, automatically open its proprietary program. With Canon, you must install their software then, try to figure out how things work as you go. The user manual is of little help. 

Considering the quality of the A590, I would have expected much more
in the both the ease of installation and, user friendliness of the software.

Every time I connect the camera to download images, I must manually
select the Canon camera window utility from a pull down menu that appears to view or download my images. Its so much easier with my other 4 cameras to simply drag and drop the files wherever I want to put them in explorer.

I would still recommend the camera.....just not the software that comes with it. Also, unlike other cameras that act much the same as a flash drive does when connected to various PCs, with this Canon, if you ever have the desire to connect the unit to a PC other then your own, you will first have to bring the software with you and install it on that PC.

<Content>You gotta love this camera - it is great for the price and very handy to have for those special photo opportunities that arise with changing light and scenes that are striking. It has a terrific lenses and does well with limited light, sunset pics and landscapes, as well as with people shots.  One doesnt have to lug around the old SLR with 3 or 4 lenses - its all right here on the camera.  You can use manual or auto exposure, and it comes with an internal stabilizer feature that really helps with picture quality. The flash recycle is a bit slow, so one has to adjust to that.  All in all, a great camera for the price that is so easy to use that even I can do it! Gotta love it - the Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera!

<Content>I upgraded my Canon Powershot A80 to a Canon PS A590 IS. I love the larger display, but miss the pivoting display I had. Its disappointing that my previous camera took four AA batteries and the A590 requires only two, but the Battery is low light comes on after only 4 days of use. Additionally, the A590 came with a standard memory card of 32MB which equates to approx. 17 images. Im not sure why the camera is sold with so little memory. Overall, I am satisfied with the camera for the price, but would probably save a little longer for a better one in hindsight.</Content>

<Content>I just returned from vacation and I took along the Canon A590IS (purchased right before I left). I never really looked at the instruction book -- since this is my third digital camera (I have an older Sony and a much older Nikon). I originally wanted to buy another Nikon because I liked my older Nikon Coolpix, it was so easy to use and took great pictures -- but some poor reviews kept me from buying another Nikon this time. I was swayed into buying the Canon by the good reviews I read. 
With that said, I am very pleased with my Canon (so far). The photos I took of scenic landscapes came out great. But, this is not the true test of the camera, in my opinion -- since all the digital cameras I have owned did great on landscapes. What I was after was the elimination of those blurry shots I used to take with the older cameras. This is where the image stabilization comes into play. I am very pleased with this aspect of the new camera. I have very few fuzzy photos this time around. 
Also, I have a one year old grandson who is the target of lots of my photographs. He is part of the reason I decided to buy a new camera with the Image Stabilization feature. With the new Canon I am capturing him in motion with a lot less blur. Although, I do agree with other reviewers on the long delay between shots when the flash is used. To get around this problem, I try to go outdoors for photo sessions with him -- or at least stay near a window with natural light. I will often turn the flash off so it doesnt fire automatically. 
I took some great night shots in Bar Harbor with the camera while I was on vacation. Also, the macro setting produces wonderfully detailed and clear close-ups.
Overall, I am pleased with this purchase. I know I should read more of the instruction book to get the best results and to use more of the cameras many features (I plan to do this). However, I did pretty well without the instructions -- that tells you that this is an easy to use camera. If you are looking for a low-priced, high quality little point and shoot camera -- you cant go wrong with this model.   </Content>

I like that its big enough to handle, and small enough to fit in my jeans pocket. It is a little slow recovering, especially w/the flash. But this is so minor, and I will learn to keep that in mind when Im taking pics.

<Content>I had a Canon camera before and was very satisfied with it. It was old and I decided to buy a new one. I decided for this model after some research. I took into consideration its new processor (DIGIC III) because it is a compact camera and most of time I use the auto configuration.

BUT for my surprise almost all (about 90% Id say) of the pics I take outdoors get over exposured. I have missed hundreds of good shots because of this problem. If I was supposed to manually adjust all the parameters, Id go for a professional camera.

I am completely unsatisfied with it. 

There are some cool features like the face detection and bla bla bla, but the important part (I mean, to take good pics), this camera is not able to.

After this experience, I wont go for Canon any more.</Content>

<Content>This a replacement for a 5 year old Sony Cybershot (3.2 Megapixels). Image quality is decent but not noticeably different than my old one. Even with the highest quality image option selected, 8 Megapixels only takes ~3MB (good ;o).

This is rich with features, camera-manual probably covers it all but does not make it intuitive, unless you read it 5 times and try to structure the contents in your mind. So, you need to refer to manual often for probably months before you get used to all the features.

The software does NOT seem to support Vista. My laptop does not detect the camera when you hook it up even though it says drivers are loaded. I am having to pull out the memory card and load it directly to my laptop (or use my work laptop with xp on it).

<Content>So allow me to start by saying im just your average joe-user who enjoys snapping photos while on vacations and out with friends. Recently i owned an Olympus Stylus 810 and was very, very pleased with it. Unfortunately i dropped it damaging the entire lens assembly and it was going to cost $140 to repair. With a week at the beach coming up i didnt have time to research a lot. On a friends recommendation i made this purchase.

Now my goals are to have a smaller sized camera that will allow nice point and shoot photography but has some manual (even minimal) controls as i do enjoy photography and if i decide to go further, ill be familiar with the manual controls and such. So after getting this camera i did a few test runs to get it all working w/ my MacBook Pro laptop. Heres my experience thus far:

Install on Windows Vista and Mac OS X Leopard were both absolutely flawless. Software went right in, once connected downloading the images and viewing them was a one click event. The software bundled is actually quite nice. I no longer have iPhoto (thanks Leopard) so i was unsure what to use for basic photo management. Not to worry Canons bundled software, ZoomBrowserEX does a fantastic job of that.

Now as far as options go im by no means skilled in the realm of cameras, however from my limited experience i can say this camera packs quite a large array for such a small price tag. The auto modes work very well, not to mention having the ability to just pop it into Manual mode and tweak by hand! All it takes is 20-30min of reading on the internet and you can be messing with the settings and taking some great low light, artistic, etc... photographs. I also found its quite easy to use single handed. A lot of times on my beach trip i was holding onto a rock to balance myself and only had my right hand available. Switching into say Macro mode is very simple. Same goes for things like zoom, flash, etc... overall very user friendly design.

Picture quality has been absolutely stunning! I truly did not expect it from a camera under $160. As with most point and shoot cameras when upping the ISO level to take dim light shots without a flash it does tend to get grainy. Although this camera does counter balance that a little, and does a good job, its still noticeable. Thats where the Manual mode came in for me. Being able to adjust shutter and aperture etc... really allowed me to take some exceptional low light shots that are not grainy at all.
 
So my overall impression is absolutely pleased! For the money i doubt youd find a better camera with as many features that can produce the quality of photos this can. I was impressed to see how small it is in person and exactly just how well constructed it feels. Also the thing i loved is theres a huge wealth of accessories like extra lenses such as telephoto, macro, lens filters, etc... Amazon has a kit that looks like a fantastic deal that comes with most of those things including a tripod. That is definitely going to be my next purchase. 

So if youre looking for a great camera that can point and shoot and has the manual controls if you think you may be interested in getting into photography, this is my recommendation hands down. I posted 11 photos in the Customer Photos section. Feel free to check them out to hopefully get an idea of what this camera can do with default settings, i was blown away. Lastly as im finding out photography is all about your eye and knowing enough about your hardware to capture what you see. Im not much for taking pictures of people i really enjoy closeups and different angles, so thats what im learning to capture with this camera. Hopefully my pictures will be a decent display of what this camera can do. Just remember if you dont like your photos its probably not the cameras fault! There will never be a one stop solution, but overall this one is fantastic!

Hope it helps, 
Happy picture taking,

<Content>Ive had fun with this camera all summer.
 I raise butterflies and its taken beautifuly detailed pictures.I can take consecutive picture quickly without flash.

I like the fact that I can use AA bateries and recharge them quickly.It does seem to drain them faster than my previous camera but I just carry spares.

The first day I played with all the settings. You can make the settings as easy or as complicated as you like. I love depth and detail and I got both with this camera.

Zoom is quality too.It can go up 16x and still be clear.The anti-shake works well with this setting. I took picture from the lawn section at a concert and friends could believe the clairity, down to facial expressions.

The concern over lense jam can be eliminated by keeping the camera set on picture review before shutting off. This way if the camera on/off button is accidentialy pressed the lens will not extend and become jammed.

Overall I highly recommend this camera. It cant be beat for the price.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera about 3 months ago from Amazon, which had the best price.  I spent a bit of time learning about the features, trying them out, testing the camera, and finally, USING the camera.

All in all I am mostly pleased with this camera.  My previous digital camera was an Olympus D550 zoom, which took great pictures and was very easy to use.  The Canon camera is also easy to use, if you want to keep it in AUTO mode, which I often do.  If you want to use a different mode or change one of the settings, there are so many different combinations and possibilities that I find it can be a bit overwhelming.  I think I just need to get used to it more.  I thought I was pretty proficient with it at first, but if I dont use it frequently and consistently, I tend to forget which menu the feature Im looking for is on.

One thing I really like about this camera is the feel of it in my hands.  I was torn between one of the smaller Camera SD models and this one, but the A590 felt so good and comfortable in my hand, I figured it would be easier to hold it steady. (My sister has a Canon SD camera and it is so small, her pictures often come out blurry because she has difficulty holding it steady when she takes a shot.)  My old Olympus was much bigger than either camera, so I figured the A590 would be an improvement over it and I shouldnt worry so much about the size.  I also liked the idea of having it use AA batteries, vs. the Canon rechargable one in the smaller cameras.  (While on vacation, my sister would go to take a picture and lament that her battery needed charging.  With AA batteries, if you run out of power, just go buy more.)

I am pleased with the photos I have taken so far, for the most part.  It does not do well outdoors at dusk, but my Olympus didnt, either, and I suspect more savy users would know what to set to make these kinds of photos come out better.  One thing I noticed in a lot of my photos is that if there is a lamp or light near the subject, or if the subject is near a window letting in bright light, youll get a bright, overexposed area in the photo.  I never noticed this problem with my Olympus, and friends/relatives who have taken shots of the same subject with their cameras did not have this problem.  For this reason I am taking away one star.

One thing I was concerned about after reading a lot of the reviews here was bettery life.  I preferred a camera that ran on AA batteries, but not if it was going to eat up batteries.  My Olympus ran on 4 AA batteries, so I bought rechargeable ones.  The A590 only uses 2 AA batteries, so I figured Id be changing batteries often.  Not so!  I started off using the 2 Panasonic batteries that came with the camera.  I figured Id use them up just playing with the camera.  I kept turning it on and off as I was reading the manual, trying the different menus and features.  Surely theyd be dead in a couple of days.  Nope.  I took many test shots in different lighting, with different settings, and downloaded them to my laptop.  Still the batteries continued working.  I took a LOT of photos at my and my husbands anniversary party, when all our relatives came in from out of town, but still the batteries lasted.  Then I took the camera on a trip and took many more photos, then a couple of birthdays, then my sons college apartment and STILL the batteries lasted. (I mustve taken over 100 photos, not to mention my training sessions).  Its been a month since Ive used the camera and just now I noticed the low battery warning is coming on, so I replaced the Panasonics with 2 rechargeable batteries.

I am happy with my purchase.  When I compared photos that I took with my camera with the same photos my relatives took with their digital cameras, many of them much more expensive than my A590, I generally preferred my photos, and at the very least my photos were equally as good.  As I mentioned above, the only photos that werent as good was when there was bright light from a window or lamp near (though not necessarily behind) the subject.

UPDATE 12/15/08:
The first time I reviewed this camera, I had only used it on a few occasions.  I was pretty happy with it at the time.  However, its been six months and the more I use it, the unhappier I become with it.  Its enough to make me consider buying a new, different camera. I wonder if its too late to return it to Amazon. 

Yes its easy to use and yes, it has a lot of nice features.  But generally it doesnt take very good pictures.  Some shots come out very nice - especially ones taken outdoors in full light.  But there are too many problems with pictures taken if the light isnt just so.  If there is a light on in the background, you get bright halos around the light source.  If you use natural light on indoor shots, the colors look washed out.  Even indoor shots taken with the flash look washed out.  

Then theres the problem with batteries.  If I buy regular batteries, they seem to last pretty well.  If I use chargeable batteries, I get about 2 or 3 shots before the low battery light comes on, and maybe 2 or 3 after that before they need to be replaced.  Someone suggested that maybe the problem was with the batteries or my charger, but I didnt have this problem with my old camera, which used the same batteries/charger.  The fact that regular batteries last much longer does give merit to this theory.

I now give this camera 2.5 stars because of the so-so photos it takes, and the somewhat faded looking colors.  If I had to do it again, I would buy a different camera.</Content>

<Content>My first digital camera was a Fuji MX1200 back in 1999 (1.3 MegaPixel) for $219.  In 2002 I bought an Olympus C-3040 for $540.  I like the Olympus very much and it takes great photos, but the SmartMedia 128MB maximum began to wear on me.

I bought the A590 after doing A LOT of research.  I was originally going to buy one of the more compact Olympus or Nikon models, but I really wasnt too thrilled about the idea of proprietary batteries, even if they do contribute to a slimmer camera shell.  I have quite a few Energizer AA rechargeables and a 15 minute charger that gets me up and running for weeks or even months at a time on one charge.  Always easy to find AAs no matter where youre at too.

Ive been playing around with the A590 for a few weeks now and I am impressed with the picture quality.  I still feel that the Olympus takes consistently better pictures, but it was originally over three times the price, is much bulkier, has major media limitations, and a significantly smaller LCD.  I have tried a number of different settings on the A590 to find what produces the best picture, and Ive concluded that I like the P mode the best with Auto ISO, Auto White Balance, the max sharpness setting in the My Colors setting to offset Canons inherently smoothed out pictures, 8 megapixels, Evaluative mode, and Superfine.  Also, center focus generally produces the most pleasing pics for me, unless Im taking portraits.  Ive read some reviews that indicate that 8 megapixels is too high of setting for a camera with this size sensor, but Ive compared identical photos Ive taken with all of the different resolution settings and the 8 megapixel setting does show more detail at the same zoomed out view as the other resolutions.  You particularly notice it with objects that have a lot of detail, such as an oriental rug or a bush in the yard that has a large number of leaves.  With my Panasonic 2GB card, I can take over 550 pics with those settings, more than enough between downloads to the computer.  Im also very pleased with the videos this camera takes, which my 2GB card maxes out at approximately 25 minutes in length.  Canon dropped the fps from 30 to 20 on this years model, but it still looks very good for a digicam video.  The audio pickup is impressive as well.

Id like to stress again the importance, in my opinion, of setting the sharpness (under My Colors setting) to the maximum setting if anyone is not initially impressed with the quality of the pics.  When comparing pics to my Olympus 3040, I felt that they were soft and too smooth.  Then I read online that Canon pics have a trademark smoothness to them, which caused me to figure out how to adjust the sharpness to compensate for this, given that I prefer a sharper, more detailed photo.  Since adjusting the sharpness, Im much happier.  Once you set it, it will remain at the maximum even after cycling the power.  

Overall, for the price Ive paid Im happy with the camera and would recommend it to anyone looking at a digital camera in the $125-200 price range.  I dont think you can do any better.</Content>

<Content>I am a digital SLR user, but since I use a long zoom often, I wanted a simple camera that I could switch to for quick landscapes, instead of switching lenses all the time.  I really liked this camera instinctively; the size was small, it had a viewfinder, which is rare on compacts these days and it felt very comfortable to hold.  The on/off was excellent, and the initial response was very good.  However, after using it heavily for a full week I was dissappointed.  Though I didnt do much reading of the manual, I have a digital SLR so wasnt too concerned about working the controls.  I knew that the LCD view was not a great resolution, but it became more irritating the more I tried to review photos right after shooting them and as a result, I also did not realize that its vibration performance was less than stellar.  When reviewing my photos after uploading to my PC, When I tried to get to the menu to adjust the review timing (to shorten it), I couldnt find it and it was more difficult to tweek its performance than I thought, even for a basic adjustment like slight compensation changes.  As is all too typical a problem with point and shoots, it had a considerable lag time between photos.  The biggest problem, which caused me to return it for a full refund is that the decals on the mode dial RUBBED off by the end of my trip.  Im saddened about this camera, since it seemed to have everything that I needed in a reasonable price.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera as a stepping stone for a future SLR as Im learning to take better pictures of our kids playing sports and scenic scenes as we travel. The camera has variety settings from Easy Mode for point-and-shooters to standard manual settings for a bit more advance photographers. The picture quality is very sharp at 8mb setting as used. Capability for optional lenses (wide  telephoto) are a plus experience if you want to consider to go with SLRs in the future.
Over all, Im very satified with this A590IS camera as Ive been using it almost everyday in the last 30 days.</Content>

<Content>Pleased with the camera overall.  I had a Kodak Easyshare camera and I think the pictures from it were more clear, crisp and bright.  This one is good, but not quite as over all quality as the Kodak.  On the plus side, the batteries last probably 3Xs as long.  I chose not buy a Kodak again because the zoom lens froze up on the one that I had and from researching on-line it appeared that it was a problem that was pretty consitant with the camera.</Content>

<Content>The A590IS, based on price, is considered to be a budget or entry level camera.  However, especially at this price point, it is feature rich including many not found in more expensive models.  The feature set will appeal to a wide variety of people from those who want nothing more than an auto-focus point-and-shoot to the camera buff who wants a full set of manual controls, including manual focus, and to everyone in between.  I was especially pleased that Canon included a viewfinder on this model, something that is being dropped from many product lines in favor of only an LCD screen.  Anyone who has ever tried to compose a shot in bright sunlight only to find the LCD screen washed out or impossible to see will appreciate this feature.  

I applaud Canon for developing a small camera with more attention to function rather than to style and minimal size.  Many cameras can be found with dimensions smaller than a playing card or credit card but lack even basic controls, much less easy to use buttons.  While the A590IS may not fit in the pocket of your jeans, it will fit into a jacket pocket or a moderately sized shirt pocket.  Rather than being a flat or rounded rectangle this camera design feels good in your hand and feels secure during use.  

Performance and picture quality was another pleasant surprise at this price point.  Picture noise is not noticeable until ISO 400 and degrades rapidly at ISO 800 and above.  Translated to laymens terms, this means your shots will be crystal clear unless you specifically set the ISO to a high number for non-flash, low-light shots.  Image stabilization is excellent throughout the three settings (off is also selectable).  There are three auto-focus modes plus off including face detect which will automatically detect up to 9 faces in a shot and adjust the camera settings automatically so that faces are correctly exposed in your shot.  Unless one of your subjects is moving fast, the camera detects the movement and adjusts according.  The 4X optical zoom is a rarity in this price range with most not exceeding 3X.  Combined with the 4X digital zoom you have a camera that is capable of mild wide angle to moderate telephoto.  Color rendition is excellent and I have read a number of technical reviews that place it as nearly perfect.  One of your many shooting options is vivid which increases contrast and heightens the colors in your shot.  The cameras ability to shoot movies with sound is better than expected.  However Canon did reduce the performance from the A590s predecessor to only 20 fps in 640x480.  To get 30 fps you must drop down to the 320x240 size.  Unlike my old digital, you can continue to shoot in movie mode until your memory card is full, not in shorter segments.  Redeye reduction is accomplished with two methods which can be combined or shut off entirely, a redeye light and digital correction.  Unfortunately, no camera manufacturer I am away of offers something that will work with pets so their eyes will often come out glowing green or gold in a flash shot.

Canons decision to power the A590IS with AA batteries was sound.  Avoiding a proprietary battery aided them in keeping the cost low.  Replacement of a proprietary battery can cost upwards of $40.  I would recommend purchasing a set of 2500 mAh NiMH rechargeable batteries and a good charger if you use your camera a lot.  If you find your batteries dying and unable to plug in your charger, you can always pick up a set of AA batteries nearly anywhere.  Battery life with the A590IS is reportedly one of the best with up to 450 shots.  But if you are like I am and use all the bells and whistles as well as flash, expect battery life to be much lower, typical with any camera.

As with anything, there are always some cons.  Writing to the memory card is a bit slow, especially in continuous shooting  mode although still respectable for a camera in this class.  I found that it did improve when I upgraded to a faster SD card (class 6+).  As with all of Canons A-series PowerShot cameras, flash recycle time leaves something to be desired approaching 5 seconds.  Unless you are someone who wants to take rapid-fire shots using a flash, performance is acceptable.  The LCD view screen is pretty low resolution and displays a lot of noise.  Much to my relief the actual shots turn out much better than what you see on the view screen.  When in movie mode with sound, I found that using the zoom or other buttons translates into an audible sound during playback.  

In summary, I suppose it is possible to find a budget camera that will exceed the A590IS in one or two categories but the Canon has good, solid, balanced performance in all areas.  Id much prefer solid performance over stellar performance in one or two areas and below average performance everywhere else.  It is by no means a high-performance SLR, but at $149 I can buy 10 of these before approaching what I paid for my SLR 10 years ago and I dont need to drag along 2 camera bags to take good quality shots.  If Id paid over $500 for the A590IS Id probably rate it at 4 stars, but at $149 it earns a solid 5 stars for performance, features, and quality with the Pros far outweighing the Cons.  

A note about using SDHC (high capacity) memory cards.  The a590IS comes with a regular 32mb SD card but can utilize the SDHC format.  Make sure your computer (or other device) can utilize the SDHC format before buying a SDHC card as the format is not the same as an SD card.  The SDHC is nearly idential in size and shape to the SD card which has led to some confusion.  However, all is not lost.  There are plenty of very inexpensive card readers out there that can read the SDHC format and upload to your computer or other device.  SCHC cards are most often found in 4gb, 8gb, and 16gb capacities.</Content>

Theres obviously a lot more you can do with this camera if you have time to figure it out, but I appreciate the simplicity of necessary functions and potential for more too.

<Content>Just a note to anyone consider the A590IS camera. I bought mine and tested for 3 hours. This is to replace my older 3.2 Megapixel Canon A510 (Which is not a perfect camera, but quite a good one!)

Short story: Stay away from the A590IS, it is not better than the 3 year old A510! Very disappointed at Canon for putting out this subpar product.

CONS:

-Pictures are soft, almost out of focus. Compared A/B with the 510 on same shots identical settings at 3 Megapixels. 510 wins hands down. 
-Plastic case instead of metal. Cheap and light feel. If it falls, it is toast.
-Screen is larger, but also are the pixels. So, same resolution at a larger screen = very poor poor LCD image quality.
-Most of the advanced features, such as focus review etc, rely heavily on the LCD, which is of poor quality, so the new features are useless!
-Uninmpressed by the Image Stabilization feature. But maybe I was expecting miracles here.
-No Panorama mode. (510 had a stitch mode where you could panel Left to Right and overlap the pics). I used this a lot in the old camera.
-Batteries and SD card in same compartment. When I take the SD card out, the batteries tend to fall out. Its just a cumbersome process!
-The so called 8 megapixels in this CCD are a bit of a joke. There wasnt a huge difference between taking a 3 megapixel pic and stretching up in Photoshop, compared to the same pic at 8 Megapixel. Very soft!</Content>

Overall, its great value for the money and it takes much better photos than my old Fuji which is why I still give it a 4 of 5 despite my negative impressions of the first one.</Content>

<Content>For the money I dont believe this camera can be beat.  I could not be more satisfied with this camera.  I have already taken about three hundred pictures just learning and playing with all the features.  The picture quality is great. The photos Ive taken look professional and this is quite an accomplishment since I have NEVER taken any good shots in my life. Easy mode produces great shots. Auto produces great shots. Now Im exploring manual settings which I never thought I could do and am getting great shots.

If you want a GREAT CAMERA for VERY LITTLE MONEY, then look no farther because this is that camera! So you dont throw money away I would recommend re-chargeable batteries and a battery charger.  Also spend a little time in the instruction manual if you are completely ignorant like I am about cameras, it will be time well spent and make your purchase more pleasurable.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera, Canon A590IS, to replace a much older Sony Cyber-shot, which took great pictures for a 3.3MP, I just figured times have changed and it is time to purchase a new camera...
To make a long story short and get to the bottom line.. the Canon Camera is an OK camera, but not for me.. the picture quality was my complaint.  I was expecting a wonderfully sharp / clear picture with 8MP.. not so... I realized that I wanted not more of a camera just more of a better picture.. I would recommend this camera to people who are not that particular and if thats the case why purchase something with all the bells  whistles this camera has..?  Hope this helps anyone out there considering this camera.

<Content>I purchased this camera as an upgrade/companion to my Canon Powershot S2IS because I needed a smaller camera to carry in my purse, and the A590IS to be very similar to the S2 -- so I thought I wouldnt have to rely too heavily on the owners manual to learn how to do everything (this has turned out to be mostly true).  The A590IS is superior to the S2 in many ways. Its lighter.  Its smaller (about 10% smaller in length and height, and half the size of the S2, depth-wise.)  It uses 2 AA batteries instead of 4.  It has 8 megapixels instead of 5.  Best of all, it doesnt have a separate lens cap that likes to fall off all the time! (It has an automatic lens cover instead.)  However, the optical zoom is considerably less on this one (4x instead of 12x) and its a bit more difficult to take videos (you have to put the camera in video mode with the A590, whereas with the S2 you just had to press the record button.)  One thing I really miss on the A590 is the rotateable LCD screen that the S2 had; but I guess if this camera had one of those, it couldnt be as small as it is!

One of the reasons I chose this particular camera, as opposed to selecting one of the many other, smaller cameras currently on the market, was that this camera has a viewfinder in addition to the LCD screen.  Viewfinders on digital cameras are hard to come by anymore, but they are very useful if youre trying to take a picture when its bright outside (making the LCD picture almost impossible to see.)

Overall, I am happy with the A590IS.  I like the fact that its small (by no means the smallest camera on the market, but small enough for my purse or even a coat pocket).  I like that it can take good photos in many different conditions.  I am most impressed with its ability to get good shots outside at night, even without the flash.  I took a photo of some friends in front of a Ferris wheel at the fair.  The sun had just set, so the sky was dark, and while there were lights around from the rides, the lighting conditions werent ideal.  The photo still came out beautiful and bright, with the lights from the Ferris wheel noticeable, yet my friends werent washed out or too dark in the photo.  I also took experimental shots of the different rides at the fair.  Depending on which mode I used, I could either get a clean shot of a lit-up ride with the black sky in the background, or I could get an artsy shot (while the ride was moving) using a setting where the shutter was a bit slower.   

A few cons: The battery life isnt anything to write home about; I had to change the batteries twice during a recent 5-day vacation (to compare, I only had to change the batteries once on a 10-day vacation with the S2 a few years ago.)  Also, I still get blurry photos from time to time, for no apparent reason.  The subject is still, my hands are steady, and yet photos can still turn out blurry.  This can be kind of frustrating.  This used to happen with the S2, too, though, so maybe its just me.

If you want the smallest camera on the market, or one with the most megapixels or zoom capabilities, then the A590 may not be for you.  If you want a camera thats kind of in the middle of everything (except picture quality), check this one out.  For the amount of features it has and the quality of the photos, I think the price is good.</Content>

<Content>Purchased at a friends recommendation, for a trip to Austria and the Czech Republic. I was very impressed with the quality of pictures, the variety of presets available, the ability to zoom for better shots of distant scenery, the battery life (only needed batteries ONCE in eleven days). If I had a complaint, it would be that on Auto and Indoor Scene settings, the camera frequently thought I needed a flash when I didnt; turning it off got rid of a flash glare on a marble wall plaque, for example. Thats absolutely the only complaint I can offer.</Content>

<Content>With a limited budget, my objective in upgrading from an aged digital camera was to buy something with high picture quality for personal use, proven reliablility, simple to use, and with all standard features. A friend recommended the Canon PowerShot and after researching models and reviews, the A590IS was the right mix of price, features and quality. In practice, it has lived up to my expectations: very easy to start using, quality pictures,  and I have found the user manual clear as Ive explored the cameras multiple features and options.

My only note for future buyers is to factor into your budget the cost of adding a memory card. The 32 meg card that came with the package was OK to learn with, but not sufficient for use; I added a 16 gig memory which cost around $50. </Content>

<Content>When I first received the Canon PowerShot A590IS for my birthday, I knew I would never receive a gift as nice as this one again. The camera has lots of cool features, including 16x digital zoom and up to a ten-second delay picture. One of my favorite modes is the movie mode. Unlike my previous camera, it has a built-in microphone for movies that will go as long as you want them to.

The only thing I think you should be careful of is the batteries. My father and I realized that regular AA batteries wouldnt last very long. You have to use long lasting, good batteries and Im always sure to bring extra batteries on a trip.

Want to put the camera into movie mode but dont want to use up the batteries? Press display a few times and the screen will turn black, a handy feature that doesnt drain the batteries.

Overall, the camera is a great choice for future photographers who cant afford a big expensive professional camera. 5 stars!</Content>

<Content>Once the directions are read and understood, which is the main ingredient, it takes great pictures with a minimum amount of hassle.  The software makes downloading to a PC easy and quick.  The battery life seem comparable to other cameras Ive owned, the main factor, in battery life, is common sense with zooming and using the digital display.</Content>

<Content>I got this camera on sale for $148 + free memory card, and its possibly the best digital camera Ive ever dealt with. It may be bulky, but this allows it to have the capability and options to customize and take so many great shots, more than ultra-compacts. I have used both lithium digital camera batteries and rechargable batteries, which both seem to have lasted me forever! Please try to avoid normal AA batteries. The quality comes out very vibrant, clear, and nice, + the image stability is awesome. This camera can make a little amateur photographer out of you! Works well for travel, occasions, events, of simple picture taking (Ive used it for all those). The video quality is very decent, as well as the microphone picks up very well. Quality and price are the strong points here, and its really hard to beat.</Content>

<Content>Just a short note to let you know that I had some reservations about this item because of the claims of short battery life.  I looked at a lot of other cameras and was hoping for some great features without having to go to the fancy schmancy cameras. For the price, I think its a great buy.  It is easy to use, it has a lot of great features and you can use manual functions but I havent needed to yet because of all of the options including night scene, kids and pets, foliage and so on.  The camera came with two basic alkaline batteries and Ive literally taken a couple hundred pictures and theyre still working.  I dont use the flash very often, so this may contribute to the longer battery life, but I generally use rechargeable Ni-MH batteries, so Im not too worried about the future battery life once these freebies wear out.   </Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera after doing quite a bit of research.  I really wanted something that would allow me to learn a bit and do more then just point and shoot.  well, Im learning alot and having a great time with it!  Have taken some absolutely awesome shots!  Caught a bumbly bee in flight!  Im sure there are some features that will never be used,  but look forward to trying out some others.  Was warned about the AA battery annoyance,  but purchased the rechargeable batteries and pack so have been just switching them.  Also purchased a card reader ($9.00) which saves your batteries from downloading.  Am very glad that i decided against the other Canon model that did not have a viewfinder, even though that one seemed like it would also be an awesome choice.  this camera comes with a computer disc that has great options for organizing and editing your photos.  Overall, I am thrilled with this camera and think it was well worth the price.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera to take with me when my DLSR or my super zoom is just too heavy or too bulky to take along.  The old saying is that the best camera for the job, is the camera you have!!  I did not wish to spend a lot of money but wanted to still have image stablization, control over exposure and aperture,  and decent image quality, all while using SD memory cards since I have many.  This camera is a reasonable compromise.  The images are acceptably crisp and can be made even sharper in post processing, the manual controls work great, and the size certainly allows me to put it into my pocket.  If you are looking for a snapshot camera the Canon A590 can certainly produce the goods.  I havent found the slow recycle time of the flash to be a problem and and the rechargeable NiMH batteries Im using are still going strong after a couple of hundred pictures with about a third being taken with flash.  You can adjust the vividness of the color along with the sharpness and the contrast to taste.  The exposures seem accurate and exposure conpensation can be used to help with blown skies, a problem with many digital cameras, it seems.

Having the memory card located with the batteries certainly saves in manufacturing cost (only a single door) but when I remove the card, sometimes the batteries also fall out, but this isnt really a serious issue - I just have to be careful.  


I do wish that this camera had a wider angle lens (maybe 24 mm equivalent in 35 mm camera terms) since there are times I want effects that these wide angle lenses produce.  Of course I knew that the camera did not do this when I bought it and many casual users would probably not miss this feature unless they previously had a camera that a lens of this type.

In summary, given this cameras price point, its an excellent value.     </Content>

<Content>I really like this camera.  It is easy to use, takes great pictures, and has plenty of zoom.  I looked at so many cameras before purchasing this one.  This one had the best features and quality of all the cameras in this price range.  I was really impressed with the quality of the video it produced, as I didnt expect very much from a digital camera.

I am glad I got a camera with a view finder as I have found on very sunny days at the ballfield, the LCD can be a little difficult to see details of what you are capturing.  The viewfinder, though, shows you enough of what you are shooting and comes in handy.

The night scene mode really is a blessing as I have taken night shots with and without this mode, and it makes such a huge difference in night photography.  

Speed is not an issue as well.  I took a picture of my son jumping into the pool and I caught him just as he was entering the water.  There was relatively no blur and it looks as if he is standing on top of the water!
I also took pictures of him throwing a baseball and there was no blur in those photos as well.

Again, this camera exceeded my expectations and I doubt that anyone would be disappointed in purchasing this camera.  Plus its hard to go wrong with Canons quality.

<Content>The A590IS is the 8-MP sibling of the 7-Megapixel 570IS.  Ive played with both, and at an almost equal price, the 590 is the way to go.

- Automatic mode makes it easy as pie for point-and-shoot.  Photo novices will find the Automatic -- and above that, Easy -- modes a welcome way to just take the picture already!.  The auto-focus, facial recognition, and adjustment features all respond quickly at half-depress... lining up a great shot is simple and quick.
- Manual mode gives you reign over everything about the photo, from the white balance, to the aperture, flash output, and even the part of the screen it uses to calculate gamma compensation.  When youve got time to make the picture turn out just right, this little camera wont disappoint.
- The lens isnt half bad either, giving you focus-adjustment down to 2 inches from the end of the lens, and incremental up to 10 feet.

As with most new Digital Cameras, the viewfinder has been long-since replaced by the back LCD, which provides a helpful and adjustable HUD.  The color spectral graphs are especially nice to have on-hand if youre worried about balancing multiple shots against each other.

The only cons are inherent in the design:  the viewfinder and flash are almost useless when the camera is fitted with an optional lens hood / adapter.  The buttons and dial adjustments are also small, so it pays to familiarize yourself with the user interface.

All in all, a fantastic camera for the price.  Image stabilization, a 4x zoom, optional attachments, and a trim pricetag make this a great deal for anyone looking to upgrade to a non-SLR picture snapper.</Content>

Slightly bulkier than a SD750 but still very compact. A great alternative to the heavy DSLR, when theres no room. The cable and download software work great, no glitches on Win XP, not sure about Linux. Download *Gimp(freeware GNU advanced image processing)for what the Canon(works well)software cant do. I want an XSi or a D80 (DSLR) but Im keeping my money right now.  Also, I used Super Saver shipping and I live in Massachusetts, I got the thing in two days !</Content>

<Summary>Canon A590 IS, Ph!Ls review</Summary>
</Review>
<Review>
<DocID>B0011ZCDKS-733</DocID>
<Content>This is the first digital camera I have owned. I purchased it a few days before a trip to California, which means I didnt have all that much time to get acquainted with the device.

I had absolutely no problems learning how to use the camera and taking good pictures with it. To my amateurish eyes, the pictures came out just fine and the camera was quite easy to use. There are a variety of settings you can use depending on what is being photographed and when: People, landscapes, action shots, nighttime shots, the easy mode etc. These are all nicely indicated using a graphic that appears on the LCD screen. For example, the portrait feature is indicated by a small graphic of a persons profile. Theres also a video mode that can be fun.

The camera is pretty compact--not as small as some models out there, but I had no problems. One feature the camera includes that I think is quite important is a view finder in addition to the LCD screen. In bright sunlight it is difficult to take a photo using the LCD screen. I found myself using the viewfinder most of the time. I would caution anyone purchasing a camera with only an LCD screen. This was actually pointed out to me by a colleague who is experienced with digital cameras.
  

The camera also comes equipped with image stabilizer and  face recognition features; from what I understand, these are two important features you should look for in a digital camera.


For basic photography (vacation pictures, family events, etc.) this is a fine camera at a reasonable price. Part of my research consisted of using Consumer Reports, and the magazine gave Canon products (not sure if this particular model was reviewed) a Best Buy  rating.

About the only caveat I have is that the program included to load your picture on your computer is not particularly user-friendly. I wound up using iPhotos instead since I have a Mac. But on the other hand, I had no experience with loading photos on a computer--what seemed a bit clunky to me might be just fine for someone else. </Content>

<Content>Ive owned at least 3 digital cameras of progressive MP technology over the years.  I think this Canon Powershot is a great value for what you get, whether your a snap-shotter or a more advanced user of digital cameras.  This camera has just enough features to make people like me dangerous, but not too many that you are overwhelmed.  The modes/settings are easy to configure and with a little practice, you will be taking some great pictures.
A lot of people think that the greater the MP, the better the quality of the picture.  This is not true.  I was looking for a camera that I can take quality photos with and share them over the internet; I do not need a professional camera that will produce poster-sized shots.  And for my purposes, this camera is perfect!</Content>

<Content>When it came time to buy a digital camera I wavered between the Cannon and the Sony CyberShot.  I bought the Cannon for three reasons:
1. more megapixals
2. 4x zoom
3. price was right

And make no mistake, this is a nice camera.  BUT...for what I was wanting, just a basic, personal use camera, its not ideal.  It has a lot of nice features on it that I will never use.  Its not the easiest camera to figure out and use.  The dials/menus take some studying.

My mother bought the Sony Cybershot and after seeing her camera, I wish that I had too.

If you are looking for just a good basic camera, shy away from this model.  Dont get pulled in by the extra features...unless you have some training in photography and know how to use the manual settings, most of the extra features you wont use.  And the basic features are not as user friendly as you would expect.</Content>

Although the Canon A590IS had many of the features I was looking for in a digital camera of its size,I was rather disappointed with the results of the pictures I took with it. Colors were not as brilliant or faithful as I had expected. The pictures didnt have crisp, sharp images - and for these, I took outdoor as well as indoor photos using the different feature adjustments in the manual. Lastly, the camera itself seemed chinsy for me - too light that I felt like I was using a disposable camera.</Content>

<Content>Many reviews on the great aspects of the camera here, just one thing to add. The flash is OK for a point and shoot compact camera, but does take a few seconds to recharge between shots and uses batteries quickly. This is not unique to this camera and my guess is that it just takes power to make a good flash, no matter what camera you use. For those people that need better and faster flash performance, the add on flash unit is the trick. Save batteries and take better indoor flash pictures faster for around $90...

<Content>Buyer beware!  The A590IS requires two alkaline batteries; however the batteries last approximately  one to two weeks or less than approx. 75 photos.  The low battery indicator appears way too often.
The A590IS has 8MP packed into a small sensor chip which causes the photo details/sharpness to be less than say a 5MP on the same size chip (its called noise in a photo).  Advice when buying a digital camera; more MP is not necessarily better.  Look at the ratio of MP to chip size/capacity.  The lower the ratio of MP to chip capacity = more noise, because the MP take too much space on the chip thus blurring the photo with more pixels.  If you buy the A590IS, Canon packs 8MP on a small chip thus creating noise.  I had a Canon A610 for two years; 5MP on a small chip but alot less noise than the A590.  My A610s sensor chip died after two years (black LCD screen).  Bottom line, digital camera technology is not reliable; the life expectancy is not long.  At least film cameras lasted more than two years . . .  </Content>

There are functions that a person can do manually if they understand the camera and how to use the functions. There are a number of settings that are easy to select and use.

<Content>Dont you just love it when you spend the time to shop around and really go after something that does what you want and you find it? at a great price??  I love this camera!!  I just recently purchased it so I have a long way to go on trying all the settings and options this camera offers... BUT! so far I am very much wowed. 

The ability to play with the settings and experiment was what drew me to photography when I was younger. Those options, the versitility that goes with 8MP, along with ability to change lenses (I got the 3.2x telephoto and .45x wide angle) plus filters? Its what drew me to this camera and setup.  

Real easy to use and Ive already gotten compliments on the photos Ive taken.  And when they do mention the pics they get an earful of praise directed to the reason the photos are so good with a quick demonstration of my new toy! ;)  Love that nice big crystal clear LCD!! and easy to read and understand menu. With a brand new grand daughter I will be trying real hard to wear the buttons off this one! :P  Did the research and I found a real winner.
and the price! 5 stars, 2 thumbs and 2 big toes up! Sweet little camera with big results! Cant be beat IMO! Did I mention I love this camera?</Content>

<Content>Most products I buy match my expectations. This is due to the fact that I usually only purchase what I have researched and am well aware of what I am getting, for the price. This camera, not only exceeded all expectations, but totally surpassed them. 

Knowing the quality of Canon, I was expecting good quality photos for a point-and-shoot camera. I wasnt expecting it to take photos that have matched, in quality, to much more expensive digital SLRs. The optical quality of the A590IS is as clean and sharp as anything on the market. It is very friendly and easy to use ( something I dont think most cameras are ).  

Canon has blown me away and made me a believer in their cameras. This camera has left me with nothing to say, but WOW! If you are looking to purchase an inexpensive point-and-shoot camera, this is the one.

Then I got the Canon 570is and it was just wonderful. I upgraded with the 590IS for myself and gave the 570 for business use. The pictures are crisp and sharp. The camera works pretty fast. Uses AA battery hence no worry of loosing power in midst of action.

Highly recommend it,I used to be into 35mm photography for years ran around all over with a bag full of lenses, becoming a senior citizen changed all that, so, the Canon A 570 arrived, does a beautiful job, allows me to fool around somewhat.
My wife saw a 590, loved it, we bought it, well, its a beautiful thing, from the start up, the photos were not as good as the 570, in fact, just not that good, period.  We were unhappy with it and returned it, I firmly believe the 590 we received was defective, yeah, even Canon goofs,, photos were not clear, flash did not work right, lens was bad, other than that it was great, have seen tourists here in Manhattan using the 590, spoke with them, saw their results, gorgeous, soooooooooo,I think we may reorder it from Amazon for my wife, firmly convinced I got one that slipped through, Canon is a great company, but we all goof occassionly</Content>

<Content>I did a fair amount of homework before buying the Canon Power Shot A590 IS with face recognition technology and image stabilization.  Although it received many good reviews, my experience with the camera was very disappointing. Thw first big surprise was that although this is labeled a point and shoot digital camera, it has many features that allow an experienced photographer to modify the settings and make custom modifications.  Im not an experienced photographer and was easily overwhelmed by the choices, especially since the instruction manual jumped right in discussing these things before it even explained the basics of how the camera worked.  The book didnt get to the basics until page 40!  I have 2 other digital cameras that Ive used for several years  so I am familiar with how many digital cameras are set up----not that this helped.  This model Canon represents some significant design changes in digital cameras which I wasnt prepared for.  To make things worse, the instruction manual in many cases was incomplete or inaccurate.  I quickly became best friends with Canons technical support department just to learn how to use the camera! Although the tech reps were pleasant and tried to be helpful, sometimes they didnt know the whole story either.  I also had problems with the software that comes with the camera for downloading pictures to my computer and editing them.  When I first installed it, it worked fine.  Then everytime I used it something went wrong and I had to call tech support for assistance.  The problem would get resolved only to reappear a few days later and the prior solution wouldnt work any more. Even the tech reps couldnt explain why  While the camera worked OK most of the time, it didnt function correctly all of the time which was really frustrating.  Also the picture quality was inconsistent.  Some pictures came out good, others (taken the same way) were lousy. I had so many problems with both the camera and software, even though they were brand new, I came to the conclusion that maybe I got a defective model so I returned it.  After everything the camera put me through, I didnt want to waste my time trying another one so I am looking for a different digital camera to replace my older ones.  If you are considering buying this camera, I wish you luck.  Youll need it!

<Content>Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom

We got this camera because our A620 failed to work right before my daughters 5th Birthday. I opted for another Canon because we really liked the ease of use and quality of pictures from the A620. Wed used that camera almost daily with 5 y/o and 2.5y/o kids. 
THe A590IS works OK. The pictures are adequate, but seem to be less defined than the A620. My only other real complaint is the recharge time from picture to picture. THe A620 is faster (maybe two extra batteries helps?). The decrease in battery use (two from four) makes the A590IS lighter, but also feels cheaper. We ae overall satisfied, but we went ahead and got the A620 fixed since we really like its design and functionality.

<Content>This camera is excellent. I have been using a Kodak Easyshot for almost 6 years, which my family and I have loved. However, six years later, the Canon is proving to be an amazing upgrade.

The A590 is a perfect grab-n-go camera. While it is not small, it is also not too bulky to fit into my wifes pocket book, or for me to carry around for a few hours.

I really enjoy the image stabilization and both my wife and I have found the camera very easy to use. The easy feature is nice, but almost unnecessary as the other options for picture taking are pretty self explanatory.

Overall, I highly recommend this camera for people who arent looking to be photographers, but need a camera that performs well and takes pictures that, for me, almost pass as photographer quality.</Content>

<Content>I have had this camera a little less than a month and have already taken 1200 pictures on it!  1089 of these were on on a trip to Alaska, while the rest were practice shots to become familiar with the camera.  I am very impressed with the results as the beauty of our trip comes through perfectly in the photos.

I bought this camera as a backup to my aging Canon S2IS with its 12X zoom, just in case it decided to quit during the trip.  The S2 survived and was used almost as much as the 590 - just the opposite of what I expected.  The size and convenience of the larger LCD screen on the 590 quickly made it a favorite of mine, and my wifes.  Because the Canon controls were very similar on both cameras, it was easy to learn, and switch between cameras.  The newer Zoom Browser software is better than the S2s, but similar and was easy to learn.

I have not figured out how to disable the flash on the Auto setting, other than after I turn the camera on.  The camera takes great shots inside with some light, and the flash washes some of these out, if used.  I feel the default setting should be Off for the flash, even in the Auto setting, but can understand why it is On.  I just have to remember to turn the flash off whenever I turn the 590 on.

The only complaint I had of the 590 was the slowness of taking a picture.  However, I discovered in my haste to get a new memory card before the trip, I had picked up an SD card, rather than an SDHC card.  I feel the new SDHC card I ordered will solve that problem.

I used the Landscape setting for many shots of Mt. McKinley, Denali, glaciers, and others with great results.

Thanks to Amazon and the reviews submitted by other 590 owners, I am really enjoying this PowerShot and the unbelievable beauty of Alaska that it captured!</Content>

<Content>I replaced a very worn out camera that was slow, splotchy, and used to be fairly high end.  The PowerShot takes beautiful pictures.  I highly recommend reading the manual before trying to use it.  There are a ton of features, but specifically a few that are good for point-and-shoot users like myself (including automatic, kids and pets, night-time, etc).  Its not super fast to take the picture and reload, but I understand that is a limitation of a camera powered by AA batteries.  The viewscreen on the back is wonderful.  I particularly like that the picture is high enough quality to be able to edit to a close-up and still print a pretty large, but still high quality image.  Paired with a good photo-editing software, this is a terrific upgrade for us!  

My whole family uses PowerShots and love them.  We tried a different model and it continues to impress.

<Content>Great camera, takes beautiful pictures it has lots of features, 4X zoom (most compact and ultracompact cameras have a 3X zoom), for those who want to step away from the auto mode it has manual controls to take even better pictures, it may seem a little bulky for some, it is not certainly the kind of camera you would carry in your shirt pocket without it looking a little droopy, if you are looking for something really small try the SD1100 IS, but if you are looking for a great compact camera this is the one. Rememeber it runs on AA batteries,(you can buy AA in any drugstore when your on vacation), so it cant be as small as the ultra compact models that run on Li-ion battery packs.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera as a gift for my girlfriend because it satisfied my two main requirements: 1) it could be operated by someone who is not interested in learning the basics of camera design and features, and still produce reliable, quality photographs and 2) be capable of doing much more if one should so desire.

Apparently, the model one step down (the 580, I believe) is void of manual override controls, so for a small amount more one can get that capability in the 590. After using the camera for a few weeks I have determined that it actually does produce very sharp, nicely color toned pictures if you simply put it on AUTO or P, point, remember to hold the shutter half way down for a second to focus, and shoot. Perhaps learning when to force the flash to provide fill would be a handy, not too complicated step to learn, one which would greatly improve most backlit shots. Im still trying to teach that :-) (its only one button, hey!!)but I think I will eventually succeed. All in all, you can carry it anywhere and use it quickly and easily and without any real knowledge or skill manage to eke out a decent (if not really lovely) exposure.

If you understand something about how modern cameras are programmed, the manual controllability of this little demon will delight you. In bright light situations, its a good thing to be able to use the traditional viewfinder which is not always provided these days in many other point and shoots. And if you wanted a quality shot, understanding how to use the many features intelligently, I think you will be amazed that the file  produces such a high quality photograph. Five years ago it would have cost many hundreds more to achieve this quality, and now its available for a pittance. Progress.

I havent delved into the technical aspects of this camera here because I am assuming that most people who are looking for this kind of one would not be that interested. Suffice to say, this little camera does lots of stuff and it does it all with ease and grace and for a low price. Sounded good to me, and Im glad I bought it. You could do different for the price, but not, I dont think, better. Highly recommended.</Content>

<Content>Let me start by saying I returned this camera already.  The main reason was because the wife wanted to go back to something smaller aka a subcompact camera.  I had to agree with her there after a few days of using the camera.

Second, she did not like the recharge time between flash pictures.  I didnt time it, but it seemed like at least 5 or 6 seconds.  I guess thats fairly typical of cameras with 2 AA batteries, but I could be wrong.

The subcompact we had before (Canon SD600) seemed alot better in this regard.  It used a proprietary lithium rechargeable battery though.

My beef with the camera was the video wasnt as good as our previous SD600 camera.  And I guess the specs dont lie because they state 20 fps for 640x480 video instead of 30 fps with most other Canon digital cameras.  The IS seemed like it made the video more stable, but it also made panning with the camera more choppy.   It wasnt a huge beef as I dont take alot of video with a digital camera, but it was annoying they made the video worse.

I also thought the construction was a bit cheap with the shell of the camera being plastic instead of metal.  The zoom lever seemed a bit cheap too.

Now the good.  I like the dial on the camera.  It lets you quickly select a shooting mode.  Very handy.  On a subcompact you have to select modes through the menus at least on the old Canon we had.  The pictures seem fairly nice.  I wouldnt say they were better than our previous camera, but certainly I didnt notice they were that much worse either.  The fact it uses AA batteries is convenient because AA batteries are everywhere and  the access to the batteries, memory card and ports are easier to work with.  (Its not as tiny as on a subcompact.)  And this camera has lots of manual settings.  

ULtimately though the camera wasnt as sleek and small as the subcompact we had before.  It didnt take as nice of video and it seemed slower in between pictures specifically flash pictures.he only advantage to this one over a ~$200 CAnon subcompact would seem to be the convenience of AA batteries and a slightly greater zoom although perhaps some would find a larger camera easier to hold.</Content>

<Content>Argh, cant believe a new camera with 8M pixels cannot support date stamp!  All other cameras can do date stamp.  Yes, it does at 1600x1200 resolution mode only but then why buy a 8M pixel camera to shoot in 2M mode?!?  Geez...

Also, the canon software will not upload to a network drive (like my NAS so I have to manually transfer them after it uploads to the local disk).

Other than those 2 easy but critical features, its a good camera.  Well built.  I bought a nikon 8M and it was flimsy (but it did the above 2 features fine).  The nikon broke in 6 months so I bought this canon on its good reviews.  So much for reviews.

<Content>I read reviews on quite a few cameras before purchasing this one, so I had high hopes that it would live up to my expectations.  My usual camera of choice is a Canon digital SLR, but I wanted a small point-and-shoot digital for times when I cant carry my big camera around.

This camera is okay.  The photos taken indoors with flash are often dark and a bit grainy, especially if the zoom is used at all.  Im rarely happy with the way my indoor shots turn out.  It does best outdoors - those photos have much better color and brightness.  However, in auto mode it does a poor job with moving objects - they always blur.  I have to play around a bit with the other modes to see if I can get better action shots with it.

In summary, this camera isnt as good as I hoped, but its better that having no camera at all.</Content>

<Content>I am not a guy who knows all the mumbo jumbo stuff about cameras. What I do know is value and quality and this camera has both. It is light weight and can easly fit in your breast shirt pocket. It only takes 2 AA bateries to operate and is really easy to use. When I take a picture I use the automatic mode (Im to busy taking pictures to worry about all the different kinds of modes and stuff), just point and click, real easy. The pictures come out great and even though you my be moving a little there is no blur. The video aspect is great also, the only limit is the ammount of memory you have in the camera. They say this is an entry level camera, but I disagree. It for sure is a mid level entry digital camera. Maybe one day Ill learn what all this camera can do and really be astonished. All in all a great buy.  </Content>

<Content>So I was looking for something with slightly more features then a cheap point and shoot camera.  I used to have an older Canon and thought I would give them a try again, and I have to say I am rather pleased with my purchase.  The camera turns on and is ready to take picutres quickly.  The Auto mode is great for most daylight or well lit settings. The Night-Scene Mode works great if you are taking picutres during the night or in a dim room.  Colors are vibrant and crisp, and the image stabilization works rather well when using the zoom.  I really like all the available customization options for Exposure and and White Balance, that helps if you know a bit about what you are doing and want to take some specialized shots, which is exactly what I was looking for.

I only have one thing that I dont like so far about the camera.  I would have liked something more then just a 4x Optical Zoom.  A 6x or 8x would have been a lot nicer, although you can purchase additional lenses for this, which is a great option.  However, this seems to be more of an issue with all point and shoot type digital cameras, not something specific to this camera.

Overall a great value for what you get.

<Content>After considering the Olympus Stylus 830 and a Sony, I went with the Canon A590IS for two reasons: 1)it has a viewfinder and 2)it takes AA batteries.  The viewfinder is particularly useful to me as I bought the camera specifically to take photos of cactus blossoms in full sun.  I am still new to this camera but without having studied too much, Ive gotten some excellent photos.  This 8 MP camera produces images comparable to my friends 8 MP SLR, a much bulkier body.  Even with four sets of extra batteries, the booklet and a charger, my camera bag is smaller and has some room to spare.</Content>

<Content>This is an excellent camera for the money! It is small enough to carry in a pocket but still large enough to feel good and have a viewfinder so that you can turn the viewing screen off to save the battery. We have taken several hundred photographs so far and are still on the first set of batteries. The photos are excellent quality and the camera is easy to use but sophisticated enough to allow a wide variety of individual prioritys such as aperture or timing. It also has the image stabilizer so that unfamiliar people can take photos without blurring them. I would buy it again without hesitation.</Content>

A590IS takes those great Canon shots - awesome detail and easy to use.  Just took tons of pics of daughters Junior/Senior Banquet - they all are fantastic - inside, low light, bright light behind the subject, outside in direct sunlight. Auto did just fine!  Not a blurry shot in the bunch!  Glad I stayed with tried and true Canon.

<Content>I wanted a small camera that took decent photos in available light and had high ISO sensitivity. Image stabilization and a wide range of manual setting were also high on my list. This camera delivers all of that. I was pleased with the quality of the shots even up to ISO 800. ISO 1600 was roughly equivalent to what ISO 400 was on my previous small Canon camera so the A590 IS can cover a lot of range in lighting situations. What caught me almost totally by surprise was the extremely poor battery life. Even without using the flash it seems abysmal. I have taken approximately 60-70 test shots and gone through 2 sets of alkaline and one charge from a pair of NiMH rechargeables. Admittedly this was using the flash about 30% of the time but thats still totally unacceptable. I realize that AA batteries dont have the life of a proprietary lithium ion, but this cameras battery life is so bad it makes it almost unusable to me. Seemed like whenever I turned around it was telling me that the batteries were low and needed replacement. I used a battery tester to check them and found that they still registered pretty good so Im wondering if the cameras battery level sensitivity is just wrong. Either that or this thing sucks power worse than any camera I have ever owned. Whatever the case, I am truly sorry I purchased this otherwise fine camera. I would  much rather have decent battery life than the dubious convenience of replacing AA cells all the time.  

Update: With freshly charged 2500 mAh Ni-MH cells I am seeing an improvement in battery life, at least initially. So far Ive taken 36 pictures and no low battery message yet. My previous usage was more intermittent so well see if these higher capacity rechargeable bring the camera up to what I consider reasonable battery life. My experience with alkalines is still totally unacceptable in my opinion.</Content>

We havent printed them yet, but they look great on our computer.  We even took some action shots during a soccer/football match, and most of those look great also.  We took all our shots in the auto mode.  

When we were considering buying this camera, it was a bit confusing to read all the reviews about the more exotic features of this camera.  I suppose its nice to have all those features available on this camera, but Im not sure those features are relevant to someone like me who is simply looking for a good point and shoot camera.

<Content>I spent a few weeks researching different cameras, because the flash on my sony cybershot had error coded and stopped working.  After the cybershot I wanted a camera that had image stabilization.  Then I started seeing this new face detection technology, which I thought was very cool and I wanted it.  I found the A590IS because, I decided to go with a brand name that is well know with photography and it had everything I needed and more.  The shots are crystal clear, the ration of when you push the button to taking the picture is good, alot better than the cybershot, the face detection is cool also.  The motion detection technology is another cool feature, which will come in handy when my son starts crawling and walking/running. I thought I might have a problem with the AA batteries over a battery pack but it actually works out good with the new rechageable batteries that are a commone thing in stores nowadays.  I cant wait to start experimenting with some of the more advanced features, like adjusting the shutter speed. My only complaint is that since Im used to the slimness of the cybershot the Canon A590is is a little more bulky than I would like, but I was willing to sacrifice size for quality.  Overall an excellent camera for the price.</Content>

My favorite features of this camera include manual mode (or shutter or aperature priorty), auto rotates pictures, long battery life, great movie quality w/ sound, can turn off digital zoom, has an easy mode, face detection is cool, and you can add an external lens.  

Cons to the camera include a little bit bulky, slow recharge time after each picture, and thats about it.  I never write reviews but I felt I needed to for this since I liked it so much.

<Content>I bought the A590 as a camera to keep with me in the book bag/briefcase that I carry around most every weekday.  You may recall the old saying that the camera you have with you (when you see a photo op) is your best camera.  The A590 fills that role by virtue of its small size combined with full exposure control.  The big problem is that the noise generated by putting 8 mpix on a tiny (1/2.5) sensor chip can overwhelm the image and render detail moot.

I use Imagenomic NoiseWare combined with Photoshop Elements to reduce noise and sharpen the image as best I can. If possible I shoot at the lowest ISO setting, 80, which lowers the noise. I never go over ISO 100 if I can help it, and usually at -2/3 on the exposure control.  Its much better to have the photo-editing software brighten up the image than the amplifier boosting the signal (and noise) from the sensor.  When you play back the image on the cameras LCD, it should look a little dark -- never overly bright (which can also blow out details).

Here are two other items about the Canon A-series cameras. My 15 year old son uses a Canon A720 for what are essentially snapshots and is very happy with it. If you dont crop substantially and arent too picky about sharpness and noise, the camera is quite capable. From what I can tell, the A720 uses the same electronics (including the sensor and image stabilization) as the A590.  The A720 has greater zoom capabilities (and hence a different lens system) and is a little bit larger and heavier.  If I were going to get just one of these, I would go for the A720 because of the zoom.

The second point is that the other camera I frequently use is a Canon A650, and it is far more capable than either the A590 or A720.  The A650 has 12 mpix on a larger sensor (1/1.7). Comparing sensor sizes (available at www.dpreview.com/learn/?/key=sensor+sizes) and mpix shows that the A650s sensor has 1.75 times the area as those of the A590 and A720 with only 1.5 times the pix -- hence pix density is lower and the noise generated by the A650 is much better controlled. And because there are more pix, the noise gets smoothed over as a result of more little points covering the same area in the image. (FYI: Greater pix density on a sensor chip creates more noise.) 

I did a noise and sharpness test with all three of these cameras plus my Nikon D40 DSLR.  I set two shoes, one black and one brown (the latter with lots of texture) on a rug, just beside a sunlit spot inside my house.  The shoes were well lit but not in direct sun.  I shot all of the cameras at 200 ISO (because that is as low as the Nikon would go) and f/5.6, with the exposure control at -2/3 of an f/stop.

The results surprised me.  For whatever reason, and despite several tries, I could not get the Nikon to focus adequately on the shoes -- this from a distance of about four feet.  I know from experience that the Nikon D40, with 6 mpix on a 2/3 sensor (2/3 the size of a standard 35mm film frame) has extremely well controlled noise and excellent sharpness, but the inability to focus here took it out of the comparison.

The superiority of the A650 to the A590 and A720 was startling.  Keep in mind that I zoomed in on the images in Photoshop after I had transferred them to my 24 iMac (a great computer for photo editing).  This made different sections of the shoes appear much larger (the laces were really telling), and the 12 mpix A650 (vs. 8 mpix of the others) had more pixes to work with for any particular area I looked at.  Nonetheless, the other two cameras had so much noise that the details were overwhelmed and no amount of noise reduction and sharpening could change that. The A650s image was far sharper and clearer.

The A650 has one other big advantage so far as Im concerned and one drawback. The advantage is the articulating LCD, which I find extremely useful for many shots.  Yesterday, I had to lay down on the cold, damp ground to get a shot with the A590, but with the A650 I would have put the camera at foot level and looked down into the cocked LCD. That is really nice, almost addicting.  However, the A650s drawback is that its bulky and surprisingly heavy, which is why I dont carry it along all the time.

So you pay your money and take your choice -- or, like me, pay your money twice and have it both ways.  Remember, the camera that you have with you is the best camera you own -- so think about what size and type of camera you want to carry plus when and how you will use it.  For some people, that means owning more than one camera.

<Content>There are already great reviews out about Canons A590is. Id like to add that I bought this camera just before a 2-week trip to China. Well, it performed like a charm and I couldnt be more happy with my purchase, especially for such an affordable camera that has so many features. On the second day of my trip I was fumbling with the camera and dropped it from a height of 4 feet onto concrete. My heart was in my throat. Everyone stared. For the remainder of the trip the camera was just fine; not even a crack or scratch. Im amazed. And because I had almost no time to look through the camera manual before I started taking photos, Ill add that this camera is very user-friendly and easy to figure out right out of the box. I especially like the image stabilization and video capture features. I was also pleasantly surprised by the long battery life. I took about 700 pictures on one set of batteries. Overall, a great camera. </Content>

<Content>Pros: 
The A590IS is the best point and shoot under $200 today (closer to $155 most places). I own an SD600 and my wife, friend, and father (all different people mind you!) own A570ISs. The A590IS is the new version of the A570IS, 2007s best selling camera. Generally, see the rave reviews of the A570IS if you want to know the major pros and cons (in summary: Image Stabilization is amazing, noise is limited, features of all there including manual controls [though no auto-bracketing which no other cameras at this price point have regardless], final picture quality is superior to all other brands at this price point and type, [i.e., point-and-shoot], good size).  Rather, here Ill address the main improvements over the A570IS (which is about $30 cheaper): 

(1) The A590IS has 8mp vs. 7mp on the A570IS (negligible difference) 

(2) The A590IS is slightly faster between non-flash shots BUT slightly SLOWER before the first shot can be taken and slower between shots where flash is used (less than .5 second difference according to CNet)

(3) Its charcoal/gray - minor change from silver, but I like it a lot.

(4) Its rounder on the edges but no less stable in your hand, neither camera is too slippery like other overly polished cameras (also, no finger smudges as a result). 

(5) There is sometimes increased noise with higher MP cameras, this is NOT the case here - noise levels are similar. 

(6) there are some minor additional shooting modes and improvements to other shooting

Cons: 
The only change that is not an improvement is the lowering of the frames per second in the video mode. 
A570IS: 640x480 = 30fps --- 320x240 = 60fps 
A590IS: 640x480 = 20fps --- 320x240 = 30fps 

Frankly, this is a bummer and cannon should correct it with firmware ASAP; however, the lower FPS is still quiet good, but this was a pointless change that is not appreciated -- the reality is that most people dont use video often and those who do will see a minimal difference ... if youre paying that much attention to the video you may be more interested in a different camera or a video camera.

Conclusion:
This will be the best selling camera of 2008 and its a VERY safe purchase you wont regret (unless it gives you such a new found love for photography that suddenly you wish you had a Canon S5 or G7 ... which are more than twice as expensive!).  </Content>

<Content>The Canon 590 takes fantastic photos! Ive had trouble in the past with shaky pictures from other digital cameras. But with the built-in image stabilizer, they are clear and beautiful, even up close! Ive gotten some great shots. I can even take close up photos of books to show on computer monitor and the text is clear and readable. Love the movie mode, too. I like the ease of point and shoot, but if you want to change manual settings are available too.

<Content>These PowerShot A cameras are Canons attempt to deliver the quality and features of its more expensive PowerShot G and PowerShot Pro S lines (such as full zoom lenses) at a budget price. The results are pretty good. (How do I know? Because Ive actually gotten to use all of these cameras. I earn my living at Walt Disney World writing a travel guide, and nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShots.)

Heres my opinion of the top-selling A series cameras:

A580. This 2008 model is an A590IS (see below) without image stabilization and with semi-automatic instead of manual controls. Id spend the extra bucks for the A590IS, because those two features can make quite a difference.

A650 IS. You can do a lot with this sweet little camera, though it may be more than you need. It has a flip-out LCD panel and the option of manual controls. The shots Ive seen from this model look great. Keep your ISO under 800 and you wont get any noise. 

A720 IS. This fully-loaded 2007 model has all the toys, including a 6x zoom (35mm film equivalent of 35-210mm), image stabilization, adjustable flash power and optional second-curtain flash. This last feature means you can make the flash fire at the end of a long exposure, instead of the beginning, so moving subjects streak into focus instead of out.

A470. This 2008 camera is great for kids or anyone just looking for a good basic camera. It includes Canons face detection technology and has a zoom lens, 14 shooting modes and the ability to set exposure compensation, ISO and white balance manually. Plus it looks great, and is a good bargain.

Finally, the A590IS (the camera on this page) is a 2008 upgrade to an older model, the A570IS. The face detection system works a little better than the one on its predecessor, and the new model is slightly rounder and easier to grip. I personally like that it has automatic and manual controls, though I havent seen anyone using the manual set yet. Overall this camera is a fine performer, a great bargain and I think the best buy of the bunch. I bought one for myself.</Content>

<Content>I own a DSLR and consider myself a photography enthusiast. I wanted a small compact camera with me when I dont want to lug around my DSLR + lenses and equipment. After a previous good experience with the Canon A720 IS, the new A590 IS seemed like a good choice. Since Im an advanced photographer, Ill focus on the advanced features of this camera. The auto modes work as well as any other camera in its class, but the extensive manual features is what sets apart the Canon A series. What I like about the camera:

+ Compact, stylish. Its smaller than older A Powershots, and the dark grey color gives it a seriousness compared to the typical bright silver finish.

+ Image stabilization works very well, it allows me to take blur-free photos 2-3 stops below the recommended shutter speed, that means at 35-50mm f2.8 1/10 sec shots are CONSISTENTLY possible indoors without using flash.

+ Good image quality. Expected from Canon, but even better is adjustable contrast, saturation, and sharpness settings, along with the typical JPG compression and resolution sizes.

+ Fast and responsive. I was surprised how responsive this camera is even compared with my DSLR. Shutter lag is very low for a compact digicam, and when I pre-focus with manual focus, its even faster.

+ Manual modes. Aperture priority and shutter priority are great, the M mode is even better than other A Powershots such as the A720 because now theres a light meter on the right side that adjusts live based on what the camera thinks is the optimal exposure setting. And you can adjust aperture/shutter speed and see how it affects the final exposure. Ideally a live histogram would be even better, but this is very handy.

+ Manual focus. Although the LCD resolution is not good enough, even with the point zoom option, manual focus helps in close-up work and pre-focusing for action or creative photography.

+ Manual flash modes. In addition to automatic flash. The manual flash allows me to adjust the flash power in 3 levels, and prevents a pre-flash. This last part is important for using a remote optical slave flash. I can basically take professional looking studio pictures with this camera with my external flash equipment.

+ Optical viewfinder. I dont use this much yet, but can come in handy in bright sunlight conditions, or when battery conservation is needed.

+ Battery performance seems improved over previous A powershots too. The official specs give it 220 shots on regular alkalines and 500 on rechargeable NiMHs. Good news is they use common AA batteries that you can buy anywhere instead of proprietary models with specific chargers.

Now the negatives. I hope Canon can improve these aspects in their future models.

- Slow flash recycle times. This is to be expected from a camera that takes AA batteries. Would be nice if the LCD didnt blank out after a full flash discharge. Not a big deal since I use an external flash anyway, and the cameras flash is manually set to medium output as trigger (so recharge is faster). I would not want to give up the AA battery convenience for a faster flash recycle time though.

- Higher resolution LCD. The 2.5 115k resolution LCD is ok for framing and casual browsing, but higher resolution would be nice.

-Live histogram while shooting. This feature is available when reviewing a photo, but not live. Other manufacturers have implemented this, and Canon should also, especially since the unofficial CHDK software mod allows such a feature.

- Larger aperture would be nice. Such as f/2.0 (instead of f/2.6) at the wide end, and f/4.0 (instead of f/5.5) at the telephoto end. That way a lower ( less noisy) ISO can be used in dim conditions or when fast shutter speeds are needed to freeze action. All the electronics in the world cant replace a good large lens. Also allows more creative depth of field control.

- A wider wideangle would be nice, 28mm instead of 35mm (35mm equiv). Id rather see a wider wideangle than a longer zoom.

- Video feature is not ideal. Optical zoom is not available during recording of video. And the more efficient MPEG4 compression is not used, so video files tend to be large. Also noticed at 640x480 resolution, the highest fps is now 20 instead of 30 from other A models. A definite step backwards.

- Noise at higher ISOs. This is due to the smaller sensor on compact cameras. But 8 MP is probably the most pixels that can be crammed into a small 1/2.5 sensor. Id rather have a cleaner picture at 6-7 MP than a noisy 8 MP picture. And if in-camera noise reduction is used, Id like to see an adjustable setting for how much is being applied.

- And if I were to be really critical: Theres no indicator of what optical zoom level Im at. Slight image noise is noticeable even at ISO 80 when I zoom in really close on a monitor view. When at the widest angle  aperture, theres slight barrel distortion and blurriness on the corners. Not many compact cameras can do better in terms of image quality, but Im pointing them out here because even though this camera beats most of the competition, it still has room for improvement.

So overall its a great camera for the price. Offering great image quality with the auto settings for the casual user, but also a powerful set of features for the more advanced photographer.</Content>

<Content>This camera was bought simply to be able to snap pictures anywhere. I bought this camera because I was very unhappy with my Canon Powershot and the picture quality I was getting out of it. I owned a Pentax before the Canon and I loved it (unfortunately so did my puppies). My husband and I love the outdoors and we whitewater raft throughout the summer and take vacations to oceanic regions, so the waterproof option was highly desirable for us. I think the picture quality is amazing and there are so many features in the easy to navigate menu that you can get just the right setting for pretty much anything that an average person would need to take pictures of.  The battery life has been good, much better than my previous cameras. I will, however, be purchasing a second battery that can be charged in advance for especially long days out. I highly recommend this camera.</Content>

<Content>This camera is great if you need to take photos out of the roof of your house! Ive take it to a rafting tour here on Costa Rica to the Pacuare River, also I have use it for taking photos to my turtle inside the pool where he lives and never found a problem with water inside the camera.

You can be sure that youll get an excellent camera and can forget about water and rain, also dust that can damage the camera lens, thats because Optio W60 is hermetic until some deep on the water and the lens are protected also, so dust can get inside! Thats great, my previous camera had some problems with dust on the lens and was a big deal to repair it.

Some of the features I like the most from my Optio W60 are:
- Lens doesnt extend outside the camera (no more dust problems)
- Waterproof (I can take my camera to the pool, river, take photos of my turtle on his pool)
- HD video, I took some cool videos on a rafting tour that cant be taken without a waterproof camera (check my videos on youtube, my username is kraos57)
- Optical zoom while recording HD videos, having this feature is for me something very useful, not so many cameras support it, but when you can use optical zoom, you have lots of posibilities and the flexibility to take more cool videos.
- SDHC memory, so you have a lot of space at cheap price for your photos
- Nice design, I own the blue model and its very cool, and amazingly 
lightweight.
- Green light to indicate power on status (very useful!!)
- Long battery life, even recording HD videos.

Some of the features that can be improved:
- HD video is just 15fps at 1280*720, other video resolutions have 30fps.
- A faster shutter speed on the Sports mode to prevent blur.

This is what I can tell you about this camera, I hope I help you decide which is the right camera for you, but for me Pentax is a great brand, and with Optio W60 is the kind of camera I always wanted for my outdoors trips.  </Content>

<Content>This is a really nice camera if you are looking for something that goes anywhere and will last through just about anything, then this is the camera for you.  While the all-terrain characteristics of this camera are outstanding, the photo quality is not.  The camera is slow when in auto mode and it really has a hard time with darker situations, with flash coming on at strange times and really messing with photos at times.  SO bottom line you wont find a better camera for roughing it and take reasonable photos, but if you are really picky about your photos then you may be disappointed with many of the photos you take with this camera.  For me its worth it because I dont want to have to worry about having to baby my camera!!    </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for a surf trip to Panama. It worked fantastic in and out of the water. Although it does not say it is shock proof, I droped it 2X and it still works fine. I have been using it as my everyday camera and seems to take great photos. One of the best functions is the green button. You can set the type of photo you want to take and a default style. For example, you can set your default to portrait and then select outdoor, action or any other setting... Then by hitting one button go back to one or the other without having to scroll through the menu options.

<Content>I purchased the W60 to take on a tropical beach vacation.  Also considered the Olympus (rejected due to numerous reviews complaining of shutter lag) and the new Panasonic (too expensive).

My first impression on opening the box was intensely negative.  The overall look and feel is not as jewel-like as a Canon or (especially) a Panasonic.  And the battery charger - totally unacceptable!!!  Its a huge clunky thing with a foot-long plug-in extension cord, literally about six times as bulky as Canons standard folding prong charger.  Considering that people buy this thing to travel, and that it  retais for around $300, Pentaxs blatant skimping on the charger is totally inexcusable.  It is reason alone to not buy this camera.

Once I got over my disappointment, however, I found that the W60 actually functions pretty well.  The menus are clear and easy to understand, though some basic features, like the self timer, require too much button pushing.  (Also, while the W60s got a gazillion program modes, I found it pretty much impossible to make the darn thing stop down, as it consistently defaulted to a wide aperture and the  fastest possible shutter speed, even in landscape mode.)

With all that said, I was pleasantly surprised by the the image quality.  The autofocus does a particularly decent job.  Most all my photos turned out crisp and clear and more or less properly exposed.  I was especially pleased with the underwater photos (taken down to about 15 feet).  They were a little murky straight off the card, but applying auto color correct (I used irfanview, but suspect any basic program will work equally well) caused the colors to really pop.  Video quality is also surprisingly good, especially in HD mode.

So . . . my final verdict is that this camera does what it is supposed to do pretty darn well.  Its a little clunky, and the battery charger is a travesty, but if youre looking for a decent point and shoot that can be used in wet environments (and you dont want to spend $400 on the Panasonic), the W60 fits the bill.</Content>

<Content>Bought this as a smaller pocket size camera for a trip to Jamaica and to snap some photos underwater.  This is absolutely an amazing camera and worked like a charm.  I had no issues, took about 400 pictures using 2 batteries.  Buy an extra battery and bring along your charger.  The only fault I see is the glass cover over the lense.  After you are out of the water, youll find it may have water spots, which youll want to wipe clean for the land shots.  In some cases, this means your finger, and then youll find the oil from your sunscreen may leave a smudge, which will then appear on your photo.  I had a few shots ruined by this.  Underwater - simply amazing.  I took several cool shots around the reefs and in the pool with the kids.  I give this 4 out of 5, only because of the glass lense  water spot issue.</Content>

<Content>This little Pentax camera is fine for its purpose, but do not expect it to be able to compete with normal, non-waterproof models. There are a few downsides (some that come as part of the design):

Downsides:
- slow lens means blurry, often noisy shots in low light
- flash is really underpowered, relies on increasing sensitivity to reach more than a few feet = noisy shots
- slow autofocus (really takes much longer than a Canon PS)
- some slow operation (like zooming into a shot in playback)

Upsides:
- nice design, solid build quality (though below some canon metal PS)
- decent screen, easy to see
- good movie quality (1280x720 even at only 15fps)
- decent picture quality in good light

Remember, this is a waterproof camera, it is not as good as many normal camera (partially due to design limitations, partially due to Pentax not being on top of the game). Decide for yourself if you can live with it, but if you NEED a WATERPROOF camera, I dont think there is a better choice (maybe the new Canon might be better, but not the Olympus or Fuji models). 


For the people that complained about the AF noise and Zoom noise during movie recording: yes, this is a limitation, but I dont know any camera that doesnt have this. Neither Canon, Olympus nor Panasonic PS allow optical zoom during movie, so at least pentax gives you the option. Many cameras also dont use AF during the movie mode (i.e. Panasonic). You can simply set the AF to infinity - then everything is sharp from ~ 1 ft. to infinity.

<Content>If youve got a stationary, underwater subject and time to fiddle with the individual settings - maybe this is the rig for you.  I personally prefer an automatic, idiot-proof, point and shoot that makes me look good at least 90% of the time.  I think this camera fails on most level.  It consistently takes bad pictures, doesnt adjust well to varying light conditions or movement, and ends up with poorly colored always blurry images that remind my of my first 640mb camera.  It in no way stacks up to my Canon SD700 Powershot despite the superior megapixels.  A waste.</Content>

<Content>Two reasons prompted me to buy the W60, one it is a Pentax and two it is water proof.  I wanted a pocket camera for the fishing trips and the everyday travel and the W60 proves to be great for both.  One way I can attest to the water tightness is video taping with it in 4 feet of river on the end of a fishing line after which this camera is still working.  Hence this camera begs to be played with, it wants you to push it to the max in your outdoor picture taking while still holding its own at the tame birthday party. There are plenty of modes for picture taking with two of my favorites being the pana mode and a two shot wide area mode.  Both of these are great for travel and I find myself using them alot.  I also like the macro focus which has produced some great shots for me. But there are the things I dont like about the W60.  The first is the battery and its life. I wished tha Pentax would have made a battery which has more power and could be replaced with something that could be purchased in a store for back up usage.  As it satnds now I would suggest you buy a second battery for your trips with this camrea and you still may want to take a charger. The other thing I dont like is the noise that is made in the video mode.  It sounds like clicking at playback, but it is good enough to get the point across.  In a nutshell I am glad I got the W60 as I have used for both work and play in the short time that I have owned it.</Content>

<Content>Bought this camera for underwater photography during my trip to Cuba. It was easy to use and the underwater pictures are surprisingly clear. I didnt have to sift through too much of the documentation since I found the camera to be intuitive. It is interesting to note that the lens does not extend out of the camera when using the 5X optical zoom. Instead, the lens action seems to be contained within the camera. The only thing is, there is only a small piece of glass that appears to be protecting the lens and when the camera is turned off, there is no protection built in for this glass piece. I am worried that if I toss the camera into my purse or with my snorkelling gear, the glass will scratch and affect picture quality. It does not come with a case, so I am using a cell phone style sock to keep the camera from being damaged. 

As well, the flash is a little close to the lens and its easy to accidently cover it with your fingers while taking a shot. Still, I would recommend this camera for anyone who wants to take pictures in or near water. I bought an extended strap that I can put around my neck and used a small carabiner to secure it to my bathing suit so I would not accidently drop it on the ocean floor.    </Content>

<Content>I took my new camera to Key West for a week of fun. I took my wife and kids too BTW. We took pics while snorkeling, canoeing, swimming, fishing, biking, walking and power boating. It did everything pretty darn well. General  picture taking was easy and fun but the 5x zoom wasnt quite as clear as I would have hoped. The macro and 1 cm macro  worked really well. 

The mode button allows you to change settings very fast and easily. It opens a single window with all the settings on one page so you can quickly choose what you want and take the pic. My kids had it figured out in a few minutes with no manual. Video was clear and crisp with the usual poor audio from a pocket camera. Hey its a pocket camera! 

Set on sports mode with a fast memory card you rarely missed a shot. The camera cycled fast and allowed for pretty fast multiple shots. The battery burns out a bit quickly but my kids tend to review their shots a lot which sucks down the battery. If out for a long day avoid reviewing your pics until get home. A multi day trip away from power would require more than one battery. Not a hardship as the battery is quite small.

A friend owns the earlier W10 and warned me to protect the screen from scratches. I bought a neoprene/velcro wrap that attaches with a small screw. It screws into the tripod mount  hole in the bottom of the camera body. Well worth the money and highly recommended. Its slim and catch free easily fitting in your pocket. Nice accessory.

I bought the red one so I could find my camera if set down in the field. Nice camera. Well worth the price.</Content>

<Content>Highly recommend the Pentax Optio W60 digital camera for its ease of use, waterproof capabilities, great looks, easy to carry size, its economical price, and for its many features. 

Note:  My video review is at expotv.com but I am not sure links are allowed at amazon. (show pictures  a little video from a rafting day trip in Arizona). Their search is not so great like here at Amazon, so you may need to search by clicking - top right, Community - Search member: beta . Select the member beta (no numbers, no letters).  That will bring you to all my video reviews, including the Pentax Optio Camera. Click the Pentax picture to start it. The direct link:   (http://www.expotv.com/videos/reviews/8/88/PentaxOptioW60Waterproof10MPDigitalCame/290367)

I recommend this camera for the adventurous who enjoy the outdoors and water sports. The Pentax Optio W60 can record in 16:9 high definition with a frame rate of 15 fps and resolution of 1280x720. It has underwater picture and movie modes. 

With all the pluses, a couple things to note - the Pentax does not have an optical viewfinder and in bright sunny light on the water, even with its protective anti-reflective coating, it is sometimes difficult to see what you are filming through the LCD screen. Also, in movie mode, the zoom noise is recorded and can overshadow natures sounds (see video review). Be sure to take extra batteries, as in movie mode, the battery lasts about an hour. My video review includes example first-time pictures and movies, but there are so many modes available for you to try after the initial shots. Selecting the correct mode is sure to improve your pictures. I highly recommend the Pentax Optio W60 waterproof digital camera.

Pros: Waterproof, plus abundance of features., Great looks, compact and nice color., HD movie mode.

Cons: Quieter zoom when taking movies., Optical viewfinder., Batteries that last longer.

<Content>After a bit of research I finally settled on the W60.  Pictures were fairly washed out but it was better than missing out on memories at the beach.  After the first use I notice small sand particles on the rubber seal (this protects the battery/SD Card area).  Tried to remove as much as possible.  Then a few minutes into my shallow underwater shots in Waikiki the camera went blank... the small particles of sand must have created enough space for the water to get past the rubber seal and into the camera.  Well, 2 uses and the camera was dead.

If you can get past the poor washed out colors, the mic catching the click click autofocus in movie mode and the made in China factor then maybe this if for you.  But i will never buy Pentax again.  Look into Canons new Powershot D10. I will be picking one of those up soon.</Content>

<Content>I used the camera Pentax Optio W60 Waterproof 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Zoom (Ocean Blue)for the first time during three days of snorkeling off beaches near Cabo San Lucas March 15-17 and got a dozen really good shots at depths down to nearly 5 meters. It vastly surpassed its predecessor, a Nikon Coolpix 403 in a housing. It took a little experimentation to get the right settings for optimum focusing, but I caught on and eventually got some really great shots of the unique species in the Sea of Cortez.</Content>

<Content>We were going on a cruise and planned to do some snorkeling so we wanted a waterproof camera to capture that part of our trip.  We were so pleased by the pictures we got with this one.  The only thing we didnt like about it is that it is difficult to see the LCD screen when it is sunny.  There were times under the water when it was hard to tell for sure if it was even on.  So we just pointed it at the subject and shot blind.  We ended up with great pictures though!</Content>

<Content>Hello,

Unfortunately I have to give this camera a horrible review.  Not sure if I have a defect, but no matter what setting I have the camera on the photos turn out blurry.  You have to hold the camera super steady and even then it takes awhile to take a photo and they always turn out blurry.  I tried every setting in almost every condition and it is all the same.  I am only writing this after taking a photo with a friends casio and seeing how a digital point and shoot should work.  I love the water proof...  and miss my Canon digital Elf.</Content>

<Content>a href=http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YZ8JS593XEIWatch Video Here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YZ8JS593XEI/a Im sad to say that this is going to be a negative review of the Pentax Optio W60 Waterproof 10MP digital camera.

First lets start with the basics and then you can watch the video review for the whole story.

Still shots: no issue. There are a number of capture modes such as: auto, program, night scene, underwater, landscape, flower, portrait, digital wide, surf and snow, kids, et, half-length portrait, sports, fireworks, voice recording, night scene, text, food, panorama, just to name a few. 10 megapixels allows for blowing up pictures without losing quality.

Video mode: heres where I have the showstopper. You either have videos with auto focus off and have blurry videos, or you have it with autofocus turned on and a loud and constant clicking sound recorded onto your video. Both options makes your video completely useless.

And now for my video review, where you can listen and see for yourself the problem I have with the camera (that I will now be returning).</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for a trip where I was going to be snorkling on the surface for less than an hour at a time.  I got it shortly before the trip.  There is alot I really like about this camera and I was happy with the underwater photo quality given it was a point and shoot camera.  I used the video feature underwater on infinity and didnt have any camera noise as described by some others.

However, the camera leaked a little (drops not flooding) and then would fogg up when taking surface pictures if it was sunny -- wrecking alot of my surface pictures.  I bought the camera through Amazon, and paid through Amazon, but it was apparently through an Amazon merchant who only had a 10-14 day return policy for defective merchandize (i.e. Ace Photo Digital).   That meant that by the time I got home from the trip, the merchant wouldnt take it back, even though it was defective on first use.  I thought I was covered by a 30-day Amazon A-Z return policy but that wasnt true. Now Im being told I have to send it to Pentax for repairs.  I also see in the camera documentation that Pentax recommends sending it in each year for servicing to maintain the waterproofing.  Also something to consider if you want to use it in the water.

So, be really careful if you buy this camera and intend to take it in the water that you give it a good testing in the water within the return period and that you check the sellers return period before you press buy.

If the camera hadnt leaked I would have rated it 5 stars, or maybe 4 due to lack of lens cover, but being waterproof was kind of the point of geting this camera.</Content>

<Content>This is my fourth Optio.  My first is still taking nice pictures despite the dim screen.  My next two had a better screen and took very nice pictures until the seal failed.  I was hoping that the W60 would combine a great screen, be watertight and take excellent pictures.  I like the screen, it survived one snorkeling trip, but the pictures were a big disappointment.  I was hoping with a 10 MP to take some beach shots that could be made into posters.  The center of my shots were only on par with my old cameras, but the edges were way out of focus.  Even if I zoomed to reduce the wide angle, the outside of the shot was unacceptable.

I love the concept of the Optio, but there is more work that needs to be done.</Content>

<Content>I bought the first Pentax W, and still have, use and love it.  I was excited to upgrade, but have since been disappointed.  I have tried to learn how to use this model by reading the manual...something I have not needed to do in the past.  But I am giving up.  I have had the camera 6 months now and am tired of out of focus and grainy pictures.  

The pictures that do turn out great are awesome, but so many come out blurry or grainy.  

I have been a pentax guy.  I love my old pentax, but the W60 is not up to par.  

Dont even think about asking someone to take your picture, If you dont know how to use the camera the picture is blurry.  

If you need to snap the picture fast...blurry. 

If you want simple...not for you.  The W60 has a lot of features that just make it more complicated to focus.

<Content>I bought an Pentax Optio W60 Waterproof 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Zoom (Ocean Blue) based on my good experience with the Pentax Optio 43WR over 5 years of use.  Ive been using the W60 for just over a month now and Im very satisfied.  Compared to the 43WR, the W60 has a more conventional shape, larger and brighter LCD screen, a single access door on the bottom (to the SDHC card, rechargable Li-battery, and USB connector), and many more capture modes including full 30fps video (albeit at reduced resolution).  It shares the same basic control layout and non-protruding zoom lens with the 43WR, but is missing a viewfinder (very useful for bright sun conditions) and rubbery padding of the camera body corners (see Pentax - Protective cover for digital photo camera - silicone - transparent).  I used my 43WR for fieldwork under wet, windy, and cold weather conditions and was always pleased with the photo quality.  I have yet to test the W60 under similarly poor conditions, but so far the photo quality is far superior.  Im not sure the thinner W60 will provide the same degree of security in my hand as the 43WR under high wind conditions, but the full waterproofing will undoubtedly come in handy.  One additional note: my first couple of videos had horrible audio quality until I turned down the operation sound level in the sound settings.</Content>

<Content>I wanted a small point and shoot camera to carry around on the bicycle with me. Since rain sometimes happens, it needed to be waterproof (I was tired of fishing my old camera out of two zip-lock bags). I also wanted it to be small so it would fit in a life-vest pocket if I go kayaking. Finally, I wanted a wide-angle lens and good picture quality. The W60 did all that and has actually been more fun to use than I expected.

It isnt absolutely perfect in every area, however, and there are several things you should know about the camera if you plan on getting it. If I hadnt, I probably would have been disappointed. Fortunately, none of them were surprises, and Ive been able to work around them since I have a big SLR for when I dont need a camera in my pocket...
1) no real shake reduction -- the digital version just bumps up the sensitivity and makes the pictures grainy, so I dont use it. I havent missed it as much as I thought I would, but that may be because I have it on my SLR, which is what I use for long shots. Oddly (to me) the shake reduction for videos does work...
2) noisy photos at high sensitivities. At ISO400 and above, photos are very grainy if theyre underexposed. Ive done some very nice stuff at ISO400 with plenty of light, but above that is awful. Still, for a little camera like this, that doesnt surprise me, so no big deal. Of course, its made worse by...
3) tiny flash. Like many small cameras, the flash is miniscule, and right next to the lens, which means short range and red-eye. In this case, the wide-angle lens can be the saving grace. If you use the wide angle setting on the lens, youre usually close enough to a small group of people for the flash to be sufficient and it lowers the chance of red-eye. Zooming in from across a dark room = bad shot, especially as I always forget to actually use the red-eye reduction feature. Since I usually use the camera outside, this hasnt been too bad for me, either.

It may sound like those things are enough to cancel out the cameras good features, but they arent. Ive managed quite well with it, and I often find myself carrying to events where I would have carried my SLR simply because the trade of image quality vs convenience is in the W60s favor. 

Where this camera really excels is as a travel companion. It has a nice screen, good usability, and enough flexibility to keep me happy even in absence of a full manual mode. Ive shot a little over 1300 shots with it in the three months Ive had it, and it has done very well. 
We even cut the kids (ages 2,5,7,10) loose with it at Christmas, and they were able to take some very nice pictures with it (they also took some really bad ones, but that was rarely the cameras fault...). It was an interesting social experiment to let them take pictures of us instead of the other way around. Being able to rinse off the chocolate fingerprints afterwards was a nice touch, too...</Content>

The zoom works in movie mode. I wasnt expecting that and was pleasantly surprised.

The battery/memory compartment looks a little flimsy but it has a rubber seal and never leakes.

Otherwise it has a very solid feel. Heavier than I expected. Well built.

<Content>Great quality pictures.  It is nice to be able to go on outdoor events and not worry that it will get wet or dropped here and there.  We went on a hike in a rain forest and jumped off waterfall into the water.  So, much fun and was able to get that on camera.  The camera also is able to change the picture setting by recognizing the image you are taking.  For example, by getting the image of a mountain, itll automatically change it to landscape mode.  :)  Very pleased!</Content>

<Content>After a week trip to the Yucatan, I have to say this is a wonderful little camera.  Id give it five stars, but it isnt quite a perfect product.  The bad?  Relatively little: so-so battery life, HD movies are a little choppy, low light focus and noise could be better.  The good?  Pretty much everything else by my book: really weatherproof, pretty decent image quality, HD movies, multiple aspect ratios, uses standard SD cards, easy to use and access functions... I could go on.

It was wonderful to have a pocketable camera that I didnt fear taking with me into the ocean, diving into cenotes, dropping on the sand, etc, etc.  In the end I found I used it far more than my K10D, and Im very glad I bought it: for its intended purpose it far exceeded my expectations.  If I could give this item 4 and 1/2 stars, I would, but I cant, so be it.

Ill update this review with sample photos and video when I get to processing them.

<Content>I LOVED my old waterproof Pentax which was ruined by user error.  So I replaced it with this newer Optic W60.   The pictures were more often blurred;  the battery life was much shorter; the time between clicking and the picture actually snapping was very slow and people would start moving; the pictures had a reddish glow to them.   I stopped taking pictures where I had always carried my camera in my purse and gladly shot pictures wherever I went.  I returned the camera.</Content>

<Content>This is not the camera to get for responsive picture taking or photo quality. Luckily those are not the things I was looking for since I have a Canon XSi for those ends. The reason I have this camera is to have a nearly indestructible tiny camera along with me wherever I go. If I go rafting, it comes with me, if I go to a pool, its there. 
It works pretty well as an outdoor camera, but if you want to take pictures of anything indoors, the graininess will make you feel like you dropped a spice rack on the monitor. Not only that, but it takes FOREVER to focus, meaning if youre shooting people, you almost always miss the magic moment. The 5x zoom is nice, though it does make for enormous barrel distortion at close range. If you need an all-around camera, look elsewhere. But for a beach and lake camera, this is fun to have.</Content>

<Content>I was hesitant to buy this camera at first since I want just one camera that can work inside, outside, underwater, etc. Have tested this out pretty thoroughly and love it. The only issue at all is that sometimes it has trouble focusing or deciding what youre taking a picture of, especially when its a photo of people inside. This can be fixed by using the mode options instead of just leaving it on Auto. Very happy with the purchase, and hoping to have it for years to come!</Content>

<Content>Having owned a previous Pentax water camera I had high hopes for this very high priced and high feature new edition. My old Pentax was only a 2 MP camera but had a more rugged body and actually took good overall pictures. To bad after 4 years it finally died. After searching and comparing I decided to go again with Pentax. Those who have said that it is only average or below average for general pictures are correct; so, please take those opinions seriously. I dont know if the Olympus 1030w or 1050w are any better for picture quality, but this cameras standard use of sd card and internal lens use made me choose this camera. While not a professional, I have considerable experience with film and digital cameras and picture taking. I would recommend this camera if you had special outdoor needs, snorkeling, pool, or in the wet outdoors. It is nice not to have to worry about the camera. I tested this camera for 3 months and will be keeping it. However, I will be buying an all purpose camera (less than $200) for general use hoping to get better pictures. I wonder if the Olympus 1030w is a better camera still? 

I bought from Amazon; the service was very good and would recommend buying a camera this way. However, if you think you may not like this camera or are unsure, then buy local with a good return policy. 

 pro: good water pictures which you would expect. Battery life is terrible but at least it is rechargeable. You will need to buy at least 1 replacement if not 2. Simple to use, but to use more advance features need to read the manual. 

 con: low light situations even with flash very poor pictures; grainy and noisy. Major, not minor, light distortion at the 28 mm setting if any light comes in from the side. Yes, I can use the 35 mm setting, and do, but why should I have to for a camera that cost $300. Does not handle non standard light situations very well. I use software post picture to correct lots of the color distortions. Someone recently took pictures at a party that I took pictures at. They had an inexpensive Kodak and I took pictures with this; theirs are much better for color saturation. 

Suggest you buy one of the specials or kits that comes with a charger and at least 1 spare battery. Also, I bought a neoprene clear cover which is needed to protect the camera, it is all metal and not as rugged as the Olympus or the old ones. But, this is not a problem, I would recommend it with all cameras today. 2 or 4 gig non special SD card should be sufficient. 

Good luck and hope this and the other opinions help you decide</Content>

<Content>I was so excited to get this camera, but was really disappointed with the picture quality.  Low-light conditions made for extremely blurry and grainy photos.  I tried to use the proper shooting mode, but that didnt help at all.  Outdoor pics in bright sun were pretty good, although once the pics were on the computer I couldnt tell if they were taken with my old 3MP camera or the new Pentax 10MP.  I was hoping to be blown away by the pictures but was not impressed at all.
A few other cons-
Navigating the menu was counterintuitive
The buttons are tiny.  
Lens is always uncovered

These  last things could be overlooked, but the poor picture quality makes this camera a no-go.</Content>

<Content>I have owned several point and shoots over the last few years and have close to 20,000 pictures posted on Flickr from these cameras.  All of these cameras were Canons.  While the picture quality of these cameras was decent to good the actual camera itself wouldnt hold up.  I was buying a new one every year because something would break or stop working.

I went in search of a more durable camera and ended up with the Pentax Optio W60 because of its claims of durability.  It is indeed a durable camera.  However, it takes the worst pictures Ive ever seen.  If youre one of those people that just snaps pictures of your family events with the flash on you probably wont notice.  But if you care about picture quality at all dont buy this camera.  It seriously took the worst pictures Ive ever seen.  I gave it a chance for 2 days and adjusted all the settings possible but nothing worked.

If youre looking for a good camera...... 

I did more research and narrowed it down to the Sony Cybershot DSCW170 and some other Canons.  I wanted to make a change for nothing more than to see if I could keep a camera longer than 1 year without it breaking.  Not only is this Sony durable and easy to use - the picture quality is incredible. The focus and the realistic colors are so amazing I want to go back and retake all of my pictures.</Content>

<Content>I have been looking for a camera with good video quality and can be taken underwater for picture and video. This is the camera that does the job. nice video quality, though the sound is a little bit low comparing with other video camera. Overall, it is acceptable while playing in computer or in TV. The picture quality is not too bad, but the slag time is a little long. I have a DSLR which i used to take picture so picture quality is not that important to me.
The battery life is acceptable. and it charges fast.
I think it is a nice underwater camera.

<Content>I evaluated this camera versus the Olympus Stylus model 1030SW.  My Olympus failed after 3 days so I returned it to Sams Club.  The Pentax is one to two f-stops less grainy than the Olympus and produces acceptable photos at up to ASA 400;  it also seems to have a somewhat greater flash range.  Both make unacceptable noises autofocusing while taking videos, but with the Pentax you can set it to lock the focus when you first start and not change it (which eliminates the noise and works fine so long as your subjects dont move away too far or close during your video clip).  The Olympus goes deeper underwater and is more rugged, but everything has its trade-offs.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera for an upcoming flyfishing trip to New Zealand where inclement weather reigns supreme. It is not unusual to get 7 days of bad weather in row, hard rain snow, down in Fiordland. Having taken several trips before I thought this camera might be the perfect solution. Previously I had carried my camera in plastic ziploc bag to protect from the inadvertant dip into one of Fiordlands ice cold streams. here was the camera for me. Waterproof and 10 megapixels. I read some of the reviews about poor quality pictures but then there were some rave reviews. I had no idea how bad the pictures could be. Every picture had a bow distortion which bent every straight line. Colours were not even close to reality even when adjusting with manual settings. Also in low light there was huge noise. No comparison with my old Canon 2 megapixel digital elph. Granted if you want a camera that you dont care about. Its light and waterproof and so it would would have served but I couldnt give up all that beauty I wanted to photograph. Also this camera isnt cheap. For less money I got a new Canon Elph SD790. What a difference in the colours. And then to deal with the weather I spent a little more money and got a waterproof case. Im extremely satisfied although in the end Ive spent more money with this solution.</Content>

<Content>I read all the luke warm reviews about this camera but bought it anyway explicitly for taking underwater snorkeling pictures on my honeymoon. The few above water photos I took before and during the trip were really bad. The shots were SUPER noisy even in ok light and poorly exposed to the point that it would be a problem for a 4x6 print.  My middle of the road canon 3MP I bought in 2002 takes much better pictures, and my iPhone is less noisy in low light. However, to my surprise the underwater pictures turned out really well as they were all taken on a bright sunny day. Now, I did take a ton of under water photos because you can not tell what you are taking a picture of (or if it is in focus) and I did spend a lot of time in Lightroom color correcting the handful of keepers (78 of 366, or ~20% )  but I am very happy with how they turned out.  All the underwater pics were shot in the underwater mode. Other dislikes: poor battery life (definitely bring the charger with you), rhythmic clicking on the movie audio, and difficulty framing photos under water. What I did like is the form factor and being able to put the camera in your pocket. 
Bottom line is this is an underwater novelty camera that does take pretty good underwater photos... if you want to reliably take pictures above water then you will definitely need another camera. </Content>

<Content>The camera is very compact and convenient to carry.  The only problem
I had with it was a glare from the sun that appeared in several of the pictures.  It needs some kind of sun shade.  Most of the pictures were very clear, except the underwater ones, which were out of focus.  It is very difficult to focus underwater.  I have been told that it is better to set your focus distance beforehand using the manual setting.  I will try it next time.

<Content>The short story, for you skimmers out there -- this cameras niche is its environmental sealing, permitting use at the beach and underwater.  If you are looking for such a camera, this is an excellent contender.  If you plan on staying dry (or sand, fog, dust, etc. free), I suggest you consider a number of alternative, similarly priced compacts, including offers by Canon, Sony, and Panasonic.  

The longer story -- we bought this camera for a trip to Maui during Thanksgiving week, 2008.  I wanted something better than the classic disposable one-use film camera for use at the beach, in the waves, and snorkeling.  After browsing several sites, I decided to buy the Pentax Optio W60.

I have used digital cameras since 1999, including a variety of Sony and Canon compacts, and the Digital Rebel XTi.  I have also taught community courses on Digital Photography.  I had no illusions that this Pentax would provide the best photos I had ever seen, I just wanted to take it in the water.  Here are some points more specific to this camera:  

1.  The seals worked well, with a couple of issues.  First, the lens has no closing covering, as is common in other compacts, but rather a protective front window covering it.  In other words, you can always see the lens, even when the camera is turned off, and the front element protecting everything is glass.  I didnt realize this from the product photos.  It means that the protective window is exposed to dirt, scratches, etc.  On the other hand, it does keep the lens protected, and is easier to clean.  It also means that there is no lens extension when focusing or zooming (key to keeping water out).  

Secondly, I found that even in the light surf on Maui, the camera had a tendency to collect some sand (present in the ocean water) around the battery/SD card door.  The door is the primary defense against water intrusion, and has a large rubber plug inside that seals the hole upon closure.  No water or sand got into the camera, but there was so much sand in the mechanism around it that I could hardly get the door open because there was sand jamming it (you have to press a small lever with your thumb as you push the door to the side).  Upon finally getting it open in such circumstances, be careful not to get water/sand in the sealing surfaces or inside the battery compartment.  It will be tough to clean out.

2.  The camera has awesome wide angle and telephoto range, 5x in total, with a very wide 28mm wide angle and a hefty 140mm telephoto.  Many compacts have a wideangle limit in the 35mm range.  The zoom range is evident from the specs, but is such a delight that I have to mention it.

3.  The camera has both underwater photo and underwater movie modes, among many others that are accessed through a menu brought up by the bottom four-way button.  I used these for my snorkeling shots.  The camera often had difficulty focusing underwater, particularly when zoomed to telephoto.  I suspect that there were two problems, the low contrast of the scene, and sometimes material (such as a bit of sand or bubbles) floating in the water.  I suffered many unfocused shots until digging out the manual and looking up the manual focus option (there is one).  You will want to familiarize yourself with that trick, as it takes care of the problem and will give you a much better success rate.

4.  The Pentax W60 has a nice movie resolution, but it has problems with the sound.  Perhaps because there needs to be a waterproof membrane protecting the microphone, the sound is horrible.  I mean absolutely pathetic.  It is almost impossible to hear normal speech levels at distances of more than a foot or two.  In addition, the camera provides the nice option of zooming and focusing while taking a movie.  However, the reason many other manufacturers lock the lens during movies is that the sound is easily picked up by the mic.  Sure enough, if you opt for zooming during movies, it will far exceed any other sound that the camera will pick up.  The conclusion is that you may get nice movies if you plan to put a soundtrack over them, but you do not want to use this camera for your childs birthday party, for example, where you would like to hear everyone sing Happy Birthday.

Was I happy I bought it?  Yes, I think it provided reasonable capability for the price.  

My daughters are also looking forward to playing with the elapsed-time picture mode (think stop-action images of a growing plant), but thats something for a possible review update down the road.  </Content>

<Content>I got this camera for 2 features, the panoramic shots, and the underwater ability. Both of which are fantastic! Thats about all I have good to say about this camera. 

Cons:
- I have a difficult time taking non-blurry photos. Even with a tripod. 
- The lag between the shutter button and the actual picture being taken is ridiculous. Sometimes the camera doesnt want to take the picture at all and requires 3-4 hold the button down, wait 4-5 seconds for the camera to focus, press the button, nothing. try again 
- Forget action shots. Even on the Action setting.
- There are numerous setting on the camera, and sometimes the camera will randomly change the setting on you, mid shot, for no reason. 
- The battery life is about 3hours..which sucks. Also it takes 3 hours to charge.

Pros:
- Panoramic landscapes 
- Not shorting out underwater. 
- Super macro mode is useful sometimes.

Overall, this camera is OK. Its good for taking personal pics where you dont care as much about quality. It CAN take quality shots, but youre going to have to work for it.</Content>

I knew going in that it has limitations and its image quality does not compare with a DSLR, but it did surpass our expectations as long as you had quality light and used its features accordingly.  Example: For low-light shots, set the camera on a stable surface and use the 2-sec timer to take the shot instead of handholding it. We look forward to using it next summer in our pool!  </Content>

<Content>picked it for fly fishing/rafting pics. drowned 2 cameras this past summer so seemed like a good idea. being able to take pics of fish underwater is too fun, as well. no problems with any leakage when dunked all afternoon taking underwater pics in a stream. I enlarged several of the better pics to 11x14 for kicks and to see the quality and was impressed. fun camera. the macro is outstanding too. 

a little less accurate/slower on the auto-focus when up close underwater. with bubbles and debris sometimes present, i realize its demanding situation for a p/s camera though. not a complaint just something to be aware of when using it. selecting the tighter focusing zone option seemed to help allot, as well for this specific situation.

 a spare battery or two is a good idea. about 200+ pics w/ fair amount of flash use and being dunked in a cold river allot of the time.

again, fun camera.

<Content>Ok, I spend a lot of time fly-fishing, which generally entails a wet and often sandy camera.  Having owned and loved an Optio Wpi (2-3 generations back), I immediately went for the new Pentax waterproof over the comparable Olympus.  The main reason that I was told that Olympus retracting lens cover is easily jammed by sand.  So I was an easy sell on the w60, after finding out I couldnt buy another wpi - which could have used the 4 batteries I now own for a broken camera.  I should mention that broke the wpi, it was so sturdy it could have lasted for ages had I not put about 300 lbs of pressure between it and a solid metal object.  I just bought the w60 and took it out for a week on the river.  Here are my three frustrations:
1. light areas are totally washed out.  I know, I have to figure out the settings to correct this issue... and I will correct the issue.  But the settings are going to need serious tweaking before the w60 will take sensible photos.  I mean, there was rarely true black in any of my shots.  Inexcusable  highly disappointing to have amateur looking vacation photos.  The old wpi took awesome - truly awesome - pics straight out of the box.  
2. some settings dont seem to stick after powering down.  i cant tell you how many times I unchecked the digital zoom box, only to find my camera digitally zooming after powering back on.  Thats the only one Ive seen not sticking so far, but Ive only been playing with the camera here and there for the last 5 days.  digital zoom is useless, in case youre wondering why this is one of my complaints.  It basically does on your camera what your home computer can already do... and it sucks battery life.  Never be impressed by a cameras digital zoom feature.
3. at full wide angle, corners get faded out.  This is a minor issue for me, but definitely true.  I read it elsewhere, so I was on the lookout.  When youre zoomed out entirely, the corners of your photos CAN (not always) fade a little.  eg, took a picture at twilight, corners were darker than they should have been.  that being said, the wide angle is an amazing feature.  In one frame, I could fit the boat I was fishing on, my fishing companion and his fish, and the incredible landscape/backdrop.  I dont know how i lived with out this before.  

Other than that, its an amazing camera.  I just wish I had known about these issues before I bought and shot vacation photos all week.  Other cool features include a digital panorama that will absolutely knock your socks off.  it stitches three photos together for you... but also leaves a little ghost at the end of each shot so you know where you left off.  The result is perfect panoramas.  Theres a digital wide feature that is similar but combines two portrait (ie rotated 90 degrees) photos together in case 10 MP isnt a big enough pic for you.

my opinion:  buy this camera if you spend time near the water, or just want that added layer of protection.  its perfect for your pocket, boat, river, kids soccer game, etc.  Not an SLR, but great for everyday use.  </Content>

<Content>I have now owned 4 cameras in this series and loved them.  The first, the original Optio WP was resold, I broke the second one at an amusement park and bought two of these for my wife and for me.

They are waterproof!  Ive taken them into pools and the ocean and they take excellent shots.  After loosing two digital cameras to quick dips in the lake these put all my fears to rest.  I can use them in and near water without fear.  Some of the underwater shots I used as cards and my 5 year old son has taken some excellent underwater photos of us.  

This model has 10 megapixels, stability control, face recognition and a bunch of new features matching other digitals that arent waterproof. It is a huge feature leap over the W30 but is also larger.  

I love these and can recommend it without reservation.</Content>

<Content>Ive owned a Wpi and a W30.  Great cameras.  After a full weekend camping and hiking in the rain the shutter button on the W60 started to not activate the shutter, the camera would focus but not take the photo, or only take it after depressing the button very hard or very long.  Ive returned to Amazon. Photos are good, especially in good light at lower zoom levels.  Battery seems to give about 230 photos with all the bells and whistles turned off.  </Content>

<Content>Bought this for a vacation in hawaii.  Beaches, water, snorkeling, makes sense right?

First the good news:
* It works well as a underwater camera.  We went to Hanauma Bay and took some good photos of fish and turtles.
* Shots for the most part are good--colors are a bit more vivid than the canon
* Shutter lag is noticeable
* No image stabilization--could really be used on this camera

Now the not so good news:
* There was a strange blip where it would appear to be working and then not take the photo.  The camera would focus and then as long as I held the shutter down, it would still not take the photo.  I recharged the battery, switched SD cards, reformatted the SD cards, nothing.  After I tried everything I could think of, including writing to Pentax support, I gave up.  My wife tried it about a week later and it was working again.  Sigh.
* Battery life is not very good.  I got about 3 to 4 hours.
* The construction feels plasticy and not well built
* No autorotation of images

Not one or the other:
* Im an avid Canon user and had some difficulty getting used to the controls and settings, theyre not as intuitive for me on the Pentax.
* It has face recognition and smile detection, but Im not sure if they are more than just a gimmick

Im returning this camera as it not as well built and stopped working for me randomly and the one thing that I need is reliability over features in a camera even if it is a point and shoot.</Content>

<Content>Clearly, this is not a camera for everybody. Its designed for those outdoor enthusiasts whos willing to trade the picture quality for the taking anywhere feature. I wish I could have a compact camera that can be used anywhere but still has DSLR picture quality -- but that camera doesnt exist!

If the underwater capability is important to you, then there are not so many choices out there -- and the only two get head to head are Olympus 1030 and the Pentax W60. Both are 10M pixels which I dont think its really needed -- you cant fully use the 10M capability because of the lens quality. Some important difference:
- Olympus can go 30 ft deep, Pentax 10 ft.
- Olympus is crash proof, Pentax is not
- Olympuss lens is 28-105, Pentax is 28-140
- Both can take video of 640x480, up to the size of the flash card (Olympus may need a firmware upgrade), but Pentax can take 1280x720 in 15 fps.
- Olympus cant use zoom during video taking, Pentax can, but records the zoom sound as well.
- Pentax has slightly better picture quality, but little noisier.
- Pentax uses SD/SDHC card, Olympus uses xdpicture card, which is more expensive.

Finally I decided to go with the Pentax.

Things I like besides the under water capability:
- Feature rich. There are 24 different scene mode, a good fit to novice users, and there are also face detection, blink detection, smile detection and some on-camera editing capability. You can also do the slide-show on camera.
- Easy to follow interface. I learned to use more than 90% of the functions without even reading the manual.
- Macro that closes up to 1cm, not so many cameras are capable of that.
- Picture color is normally good.
- Live histogram view

Things I dont like:
- Poor low light performance, very noisy
- The so-called image stabilizing is just to bump up the ISO, which cause noisier image
- Below average image quality (comparing other point and shoot)
- Metering/White Balance/EV Adjustment only available in the P mode! This is my biggest complaint. I dont know whats in Pentax engineers mind. I can live with no AP/SP/manual mode, but I still need these adjustments!
- No lens cover. Even though there is a protective layer in the front, so one cant touch the real lens, but that layer can still get dirty and Im also afraid to simply put the camera in my pocket with other stuff.

With all that said, am I returning the camera? The hell no! I have my DSLR for better image quality, but I still need a compact one that I can bring with me on trips to ski, beach, or even snorkeling!

<Content>I did a bit of researching on the internet trying to compare the Pentax w60 and the Olympus 1030SWOlympus Stylus 1030SW 10.1MP Digital Camera with 3.6x Optical Wide Angle Zoom (Black). I was rather torn on what to do. I was determined to find a camera that can go out into the wild and survive. Sadly, the only cameras that are compact and have a rugged design have refracting lenses, which tend to not have the best picture quality. The big push i had that made me order the Pentax is that my friend had a Olympus stylus 1000 and it took rather poor pictures and had even worse movie quality. Furthermore, i know Pentax and Casio have done a few deals with regards to lenses - i had a Casio Exilim Z600 that took amazing pictures so i gave the w60 a shot

So here is why im considering keeping it:
-its water proof up to 13 feet! and it can stay underwater for over 2 hours
-its stylish. Its nothing compared to my older casio exilim, but it has a nice body casing thats sleek looking
-it has a 5x optical zoom and 28mm wide-angle lens
-it takes 1280x720 video, a rare camera function. even though it is only 15fps, still this is a very valuable and uncommon feature. 
-outside it takes nice pictures, full of vibrant color
-i like the green button that sets everything to auto/default 

Heres why im considering returning it
-the camera has a cheap feel to it, it feels like a aluminum box filled with packing peanuts (dont get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with a light camera, but it just feels like it isnt made well)
-the picture quality in low lighting conditions is poor - i expected this in this style of camera, but it takes forever to focus, makes a lot of noise while focusing and then takes a severely poor and grainy picture
-the camera claims that it has an image stabilizer, but it just manipulates the iso rating so you get a poor quality picture
-the user interface is a joke! it is one of the most complicated menu systems i have ever encountered. 
-furthermore, the menu system (i.e. the icons and sounds) just seem foreign, as if Pentax decided to market its cameras in the US by slapping on English language text. 
-This is just a personal preference, but a camera should never meow. you can set the shutter sound, icon change sound, and power-up sound to mimic that of a cats meowing - uh, no thank you. 
-there is no lens cover! There is no protection for the most import part of the camera - if you leave it face up in the sun, good luck on taking a picture. also the lack of a cover allows the lens to be easily scratched. I have a case for it, but this severely reduces its rugged like nature. 
-the battery feels just as cheap as the camera housing. it charged super fast (a good thing), its light (a good thing), and it discharges quickly (not a good thing)
-the flash is poorly placed. its right below the spot where you hold your finger. the lens catches some of the reflection off of your finger. also it takes a bit of training to simply not cover the flash. 

Ive traveled to Bestbuy to look at the olympus 1030sw and i like it better. i am afraid that it will have poorer picture quality. But i plan to buy my girl friend a nice camera that will take high quality pictures, so it might be in my best interest to buy a camera that can be dropped from 6 feet and stepped on, like the 1030sw. Im disappointed that the olympus can only take 640x320, but i think its features overcome this flaw. Also the buttons to navigate the menu and options are laid out in a nicer orientation. 

I like the W60, its a nice camera with decent features. but when i spend that much money for the camera, i want a camera that i love.</Content>

<Content>have used the Pentax W60 for several weeks now, and have been pleased with results... while not the picture quality of an SLR, it produces pictures that I am more than pleased with, as well as those on the receiving end... my requirements was something that i could hang around my neck, under a life jacket, pull out while paddling Class IV and V whitewater, point and shoot... it needed to be light, have good optical zoom, be WATERPROOF, and not require a bunch of fiddling around with... ... this camera does all that... having a wider field of vision (than competition), and macro capabilities have been plusses... maybe those higher end pros and knowledgeable hobbyist will ask for more, but for the avid boater, climber, hiker, and general outdoors enthusiast this is the real deal... only thing wishing for - is write time to disk could be bit faster, but shooting at highest quality level - could drop pic quality, however knew about write time up front, and enjoy being able to blow up and crop... uses standard SDLC, according to Pentax Support - higher quality level II or III cards, will result in only minimally faster write times... have gotten a couple extra batteries for longer trips</Content>

<Content>Lets start by saying that I loved my old Pentax Optio WP. I made the mistake of going into the water with the a little sand in the battery door causing some water damage. I bought this on to replace the WP. It actually takes really good photos. My problem is when shooting video, you can hear the lens focusing the entire time the video clip gets played back. I sent an email to Pentax but received no response. So I sent it back to Amazon. Their return policy is great and Ive already gotten my refund.</Content>

<Content>I researched both the Olympus and Pentax waterproof cameras, and am so glad I went with the Pentax Optio W60.  It is a wonderful camera.  

It has lots of modes you can shoot in: Underwater (awesome shots in the swimming pool and at the lake), Macro (I got great pictures as close as an inch away),Fireworks (It took excellent pictures of the fireworks), Sports (The pictures I took of people diving off of rocks at the lake were very clear).

I bought it for its underwater capabilities, ie. it can be submerged for two hours at a time (Ive only had it under for 30 minutes so far) and it is waterproof up to 10.  But it is a wonderful 10 mp digital camera with an optical zoom of 5x.  I would purchase this camera even if I did not need it for underwater filming.</Content>

<Content>I was looking for a new point and shoot camera, I came across the Pentax W60 before it was released.  I was sold on its specs, not too mention it is waterproof.
After receiving the camera and trying it out, I became quite disappointed rather quickly.
Poor indoor picture quality.
No zoom buttons on top of the camera, they are on the back.
The flash is too close to where your finger rests, therefore, when the flash fires it can reflect red light off your finger; and since the lens does not extend it captures that reflection.
5x optical zoom was nice, but the autofocus did not keep up with far away action shots.
Thanks Amazon for the easy return procedure.</Content>

<Content>UPDATE:  This review was updated on 9/1/08 to reflect the announcement of the Olympus 1050SW.

I am a self confessed camera freak. I have owned the Pentax WPi, W10, W30, and now, the W60. My other primary cameras are the Canon SD 870 (with waterproof housing for diving) and a Canon SLR system with L series lenses, etc. I live in Hawaii and I travel for a living and I can say that without a doubt, the Pentax W series of cameras have been my go to cameras for any activities that involve water, snow, sand, or dirt. They take A LOT of abuse even if they dont advertise that fact like Olympus. For optical quality in a friendly environment when I dont want to lug my SLR, I prefer my Canon SD 870 which has noticeably better optics.

Like many people who somehow trashed their previous W series camera, I have been waiting over a year for the W30 upgrade and I can report that all in all, the W60 is a worthy upgrade to the W30 if only for the 28mm lens. In addition, its lighter, the screen is brighter, and its got a couple of useful software upgrades. Ive been using the camera for a month now. 

Make no mistake, this is a fun outdoors camera. If youre not going to take your camera in the water, to the beach, or mountain biking stop reading now and find a camera with better optics. The W60 is just o.k. and certainly no worse than the W30. As for the barrel distortion at 28mm, its probably just slightly worse than my Canon SD 870 which means that the distortion is there and is noticeable, but for a group shot at the beach or trying to get the full length of a kayak AND an isle in the background, Ill live with the ever so slight distortion. You can always just click the lens down to 37mm and eliminate the distortion just like any other compact. 

Ill also confess that Im a Mac user and therefore dont know how to read manuals. Because of this, I find the smile detect and blink detect features amazingly annoying although they seem to work as long as your subjects are not wearing sunglasses. Fortunately, for illiterate and/or lazy idiots such as myself, you can ignore most features and easily find the important ones like underwater white balance. 

Heres what I like and dislike about this particular model. 

LIKES 

1) Nothing beats not worrying about sand, water, dirt, or mud. I had the Olympus 1030SW for two days before sand screwed up the retractable lens cover (great idea, poor execution which has been addressed on the recently announced 1050SW). Also, if you let your kids take photos like I do, you can worry less about camera damage when one of them inevitably throws your camera at the other one or tries to hit them over the head with it in the pool. 

2) 28mm lens. Wide angle (vs. the typical 38mm) is an option Id rather have than not.  Also, there is a crazy wide feature thats a bit different than panoramic stitch that actually works pretty well. In a nutshell, two portrait shots are stitched in camera into a 5MP 21mm image. Its by no means publishable quality, but Ive actually been having quite a bit of fun with it. 

DISLIKES 

1) HD movie clips. I was very disappointed that the 720p movie clips are only 15 fps. My old Canon S80 had the same specs and I find the jerkiness at 15 fps too distracting. The initial press release (specs since updated) didnt disclose this. Oh well. Id still buy it. 640 movie clips at 30 fps are as clean as expected and the shake reduction works fairly well (but reduces the frame to something less than 28mm). Also, a note on reviewers who complain about sound recorded from the focusing drive, switch to infinity focus which works fine in 90% of all situations and that annoying sound will be eliminated).

2) Noticeable barrel distortion at 28mm. Like I said earlier, better to have the option available and zoom in when able. Even at 28mm, your shot wont be ruined. Also, if you have a mother-in-law you can cleverly position her at the end of the frame and the distortion will make her look slightly thinner (in case she accuses your SLR of making her look fat). 

3) Still no travel charger included or officially available (which I find inexcusable) although inelegant third party solutions exist online (and the multi battery use ones still work even though theyve changed the battery model). 

4) No external user replaceable lens protecter. Come on Pentax engineers. How hard would it be to design an exterior casing that allowed for a user replaceable transparent protective filter like an SLR. Theres a reason Ive bought four models. I trash them. 

Now for the important feature: Underwater Imaging 

If you want a camera for scuba diving stop reading now and go buy yourself a Canon with any of their factory built cases. This is not a diving camera. 

If you want a camera for snorkeling, kayaking, surfing, or kiteboarding; or if you plan to take your camera to the beach; or if you like hiking in the rain or mountain biking, you will be stoked with this camera. (Previous W series models I owned worked fine in the snow and cold whereas my compact Canons sometimes freeze) The Olympus 1030SW is a close second for me for the following reasons. 1) I like the rectangle form factor of the Pentax a tad more; 2) I find SD cards more convenient than XD cards (plus I own a bunch and my computer has a slot for them); 3) a personal bad experience with the 1030SW retractable lens cover; 4) movies on the Olympus models are capped at 10 seconds (vs. the size of your memory card on the Pentax - 30 minutes on my 4GB card); and 5) the Pentax is noticeably lighter (but does not feel cheap). I think theres also some merit to the fact that this is Pentaxs sixth generation of W series cameras. Theyve learned a lot. Also, I should mention that I used to use a Sony compact with a waterproof Sport case and besides making the whole camera fat, the picture quality suffered greatly.

UPDATE regarding the new Olympus 1050SW:  While i have not used this camera (to be released on 10/31/08) from the specs and photos I can see that they have addressed the retractable lens cover issue with a Sony style system however they have increased the focal length to 38mm (equivalent).  Id still prefer a 28mm.  Also, 640 movies are still inexplicably capped at 10 seconds vs. the size of you memory card for the Pentax models.

Underwater videos of kids in the pool rock (set focus to infinity in the Settings menu to avoid mechanical noise). Videos of them surfing are priceless (buy yourself a neckstrap). Being able to wash your camera off at the end of the day is amazing. Its also kind of fun to drop it in a mug of beer at the Hofbrauhaus in Munich and freak your friends out. 

I highly recommend the Pentax W60 for anyone that has an outdoor lifestyle and likes to record memories. Its a great secondary camera when paired with something a bit more serious like an SLR. It is not the best camera for going out for a night on the town and its not the best camera if youre going on the vacation of a lifetime that doesnt involve a lot of water or dirt. Have fun!</Content>

<Content>If you need a water proof camera and dont need to take it below a few feet and want the look of a regular camera this is a good choice.

However, when you cpr. this unit to other non-water proof units of the same price it comes up a bit short.  There is a LOT of shutter lag, focus lag, and the camera is challenged by all but bright light conditions.

Image quality in sun light is good but when you shoot indoors, low light, or anytime you need a flash you start to see really long shutter times.  If you allow the ISO to move up to reduce the shutter times so you dont blur the images you start to get a LOT of noise/grain in the photos.  Dont expect to shoot underwater photos of any quality, IMO.

All in all, this is a good choice for a water proof digital that does not look water proof; just understand that you are going to be giving up function and photo quality.</Content>

<Content>The audio in movie mode is useless due to the fact that it picks up the autofocus noise from the camera. Sounds like a woodpecker is in all your movies. A VERY loud woodpecker. You can eliminate some of this by turning off the AF in movies. This works as long as your subject stays at the same distance for the whole movie.
That said, I didnt buy this camera to take movies. As a small point and shoot it works fairly good. Dont be fooled by the 10 megapixels, though. Pictures are no where near that good. Lots of noise and a weak flash.
But, for a waterproof camera and pictures in the 4x5 range it is the best out there.</Content>

<Content>I recently got this camera, and it is my third waterproof Pentax camera (had the WPI, W10, and now W60).  The first got lost or stolen, and the second I broke some rules in the instruction manual and had it slowly stop working.  None of them held up poorly to a heck of a lot of use by me.

I have recommended these cameras to so many people.  My life revolves around the water, so a waterproof camera is almost necessary.  I must say, though, that even if I didnt need a waterproof camera I would still look at this camera.  The user interface is by far the easiest Ive seen, and again, Im comparing to all cameras and not just waterproof ones.  This camera takes great pictures and video.

I do use this in the water and underwater very often.  Underwater pictures are solid, and video is incredible (you should see my shark cage video!)  The only complaint Ive had with this camera, which I was not a problem with the previous two, is water on the lens.  When I pull the camera out of the water, there is one spot on the lens where a big drop of water always sticks.  Ive found that I can do a good job of wiping it off, but its simply not as easy as Id like.  Definitely not a reason to not get this camera, though.

I cant imagine anybody not loving this camera.</Content>

<Content>This is a great little camera! Waterproof (I tested it on a week long sea kayaking workshop), nice wide angle, great image quality, and sticky settings so you dont have to keep resetting your preferences unless desired. Auto shutoff is great, as well, especially with the tiny batteries all of these small digital cameras use and depend on. The lens does seem to shed water as advertised, and there are quite a few features built in (including image editing) that I have not yet begun to explore. On occasion, I have had trouble with the autofocus at the telephoto extension; this is usually cured by zooming back wide and then out long again. Unlike most of my other gear, this camera is also small enough to carry everywhere; Ive already published two photos taken with this camera. You can see sample images, fine tuned out of the camera, on my sea kayaking workshop gallery at www.leekrohnphoto.smugmug.com

Have fun with it!

<Content>Im very impressed with this little camera! 
I was in need for a camera that was small enough I could take it with me without a camera bag and all the hoopla. I was finding more  more often I would leave my camera at home because it was such a project to lug it around with me, so I needed something small. Since Im into camping, hiking  kayaking I also wanted a camera that could withstand my adventures. 
Ive had the Pentax W60 for a few days now and Im quite impressed. The macro feature is amazingly simple to use and takes great images. This camera doesnt have all the same features of my bigger camera, but it has all the ones that I actually use. So its definitely the right fit.

I havent taken it in the water yet, but it looks pretty solid. The battery, SD card  USB port are all under one sliding door that automatically locks shut. The controls are ridiculously easy to figure out, and common controls arent buried in the menu.

I thought the blue case was pretty but I bought the silver case cause I figured if I drop it in the lake, Id be able to see it to fish it out.

<Content>Aloha from Hawaii. 

This is the place for snorkeling and underwater photography, among many other things. I bought the W60 specifically for this vacation to complement a Canon G7 + underwater housing for snorkeling and photo op events. I am trying to add some real perspective to the vast amount of very subjective reviews, this one being no different. 

If this is your only camera for occasional underwater photos, it is a true companion. It beats by any strength of imagination all the remaining 35mm 400 ASA cheap plastic enclosed (and oversized) cameras available. Youre already spending a fortune on air travel, accommodations, food, souvenirs, etc., so make the memories and last and dont mind the $300+ bucks for this camera. The Pentax is equally well positioned for all your holiday photos and it comes in a small handy package. Its the perfect travel companion in your back pockets. But thats it. 

Underwater, the W60 has a decent quality to it. Photo quality is sharp but a little less low contrast (contrast, saturation settings can be changed). Close up images are superior, focusing is quick and easy. If you want quantities of decent photos, the camera gets you there very quickly. I would not expect high-gloss tourist guide book under water pics. For that you will need scuba gear and $5000 worth of photo gear anyway. 

Comparing the W60 image quality to my true and tried Canon G7 + housing, its day, and somewhat night. The Pentax is not too far off. I have taken better pics with the Canon, but at the expense of a much bulkier setup and a slower response for focus and shutter release. When snorkeling, I take one or the other, both are producing satisfying results.

I have no second thoughts taking this camera anywhere, from the ocean beaches, mountain hiking, ski vacation, to the desert heat (last two are not tried, but I plan..)

Positives: smallest package for underwater snapshots. Lots of options. Fast response. Fast shutter release. Good battery life (one charge is fine for a typical Hawaii day, including pool photos and review of the days results). Goes anywhere without adding backpack real estate. 

Negatives: (when compared to Canon G7). Low contrast. Slight blue tinge underwater (no surprise). Outdoor photos: less nuances, whites are washed out. Focuser makes noise when taking videos. 

Overall its a winner for pointshoot camera. </Content>

<Content>This camera is good for what it is, a point and shoot.  It takes really good pictures outdoors and inside in good light but like other reviewers I agree that it take grainy pictures in low light. The 1 cm macro mode is great. Ive taken it out tubing down the river and to a waterpark and it held up wonderful and took great picutes. Some of the downsides are that there is no cover for the lens, the grainy pictures in low light, and the LCD screen is poor quality. Overall I would recommond this camera if you are looking for a outdoor waterproof camera.</Content>

<Content>Bought this camera for its underwater capability.  It claims it can go down to 13 feet, however the fine print in the manual cautions the user about all sorts of dangers.  It states that you should not use it in any kind of current, near any waterfall, you should not jump into the water with it and you should not swim with it in your hand otherwise water will be forced into the battery compartment.  If you cant swim with it then how can you snorkle with it?  The plastic body feels cheap and if you dont make sure your left index isnt near the flash in the upper corner you will see abberations whenever you use the flash.  The digital shake reduction is simply increasing the ISO to reduce the shaking.  However, at an ISO of 6400 the noise is the worst I have ever seen!  In fact, every photo I took was VERY grainy.  I can only say two positive things about this camera: (1) The built in red eye removal of photos which you have already taken seemed to work pretty well and (2) the 28 mm wide angle was kinda neat.  However, this camera is a bad choice overall.  I returned it shortly after recieving it because it was so bad.</Content>

<Content>I had really high hopes for the new Pentax waterproof, but have been sadly disappointed. The handling of the camera is really nice - all the functions work well, and its really convenient to have the camera in the pocket of my PFD while kayaking. The problem is lousy image quality - I mean really lousy. All photos are extremely grainy, and Im shooting at the highest quality the camera offers. The claim is 10MP, but the photos cant hold a candle to my old 4MP camera. There is not enough resolution to work with in cropping photos. The camera cant handle backlighting and burns out on highlights even with the sun in back of you. For low light situations it is useless. I love my Pentax digital SLRs, but this model is not ready for prime time - Im returning it.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for my husband, but after trying it out he discovered that that half of every photo was blurry. It may be that this is a problem of the particular camera we received but there were other problems as well. The screen is not viewable in bright day light conditions, the screen itself looked grainy, and many of the controls were not easy to access. If you want to change the EV you have to go through several steps each time you take a photo. And the manual focus sounds great but it really just gives you a distance choice that you choose and no real time focus display in the LCD monitor. There were other disappointments, too many to list. The concept of the camera is great but it just missed the mark in its current form. Hopefully Pentax will work on this camera and release a much improved version in the future.
If you want to read the owners manual before purchasing, go to the Pentax Canadian web site; they have it available for PDF download. The US site did not have it available the last time I checked.</Content>

<Content>I wanted a camera that was good underwater, but also for everyday use (since Im not in the water that often.) This one comes close, but not quite, hence the 4 stars.

The underwater picture was great, but you definitely need clear water, otherwise murky lake water yields fuzzy pictures. 

Its not shockproof unlike the Olympus 840 SW I had which was water and shock proof. But the audio on the videos were better then the Olympus 840 SW. There is still some clicking on the Pentex Optio W60 even when I turned off Autofocus and set it to MF, PF or Infinity. To me, its pretty minor compared to the 840 SW... but still occasionally annoying enough that I will need another camera to do videos.

The HD video is nice, but as someone else pointed out, the low 15 fps means that it isnt very smooth.

I also find the lack of cover on the lens annoying since fingerprints get on it.

Other then that, I do like that it can take pictures at very close distances, and the LCD viewer seems pretty clear to me. And the user interface pretty friendly.

I find the picture quality reasonably good, and dont even bother to use the highest 10 MB setting. I use the next lower one.</Content>

<Content>I purchased the W60 primarily on the strength of it being a waterproof camera with 720p HD video.  I have two Pentax DSLRs and generally like the brand.

The camera itself is pretty terrific, with a slew of features (face/smile detection, audio recorder, waterproof) that are nicely customizable.  Still image quality is good, especially if you limit the Auto ISO to 50-400 to manage the noise.  The camera is quick to focus, and the flash seems powerful enough.  Ive printed out a few of the images on a Canon Pro9000 printer and they look good.

Note, the HD video is 15 fps, which makes it stutter. Itll work in a pinch for HD filmmakers who always want an HD device in their pocket, but indoors, it can be grainy and has artifacts. If you actually want sound on your video, you MUST disable the AF, as its always making a clicking noise while youre shooting.  So, either you forget about having decent audio or you set the camera to manual, infinity or pan focus prior to hitting record.  Ive tried that on Infinity and that works for me.  To their credit, Pentax admits this sound issue a couple of times in the truly comprehensive manual.

I was briefly tempted to return the W60 on the basis of these video limitations and exchange it for the Lumix FZ5a, which has 30 fps 720p and a longer optical zoom.  

However, the fact that this small camera is waterproof is just darn cool (particularly for those who like to kayak or hang out at the beach).  There are few options otherwise (the Olympus, or carrying around a waterproof case), and the W60s feature set is otherwise great.  So it really comes down to what compromises youre prepared to make.  Frankly, I love the freedom to shoot underwater or in the rain with this camera.  Ill live with the video limitations.  Its a keeper!

<Content>I just got this camera the other day.   So far it seems like a good compromise camera.   I kayak a lot, and I dont want to risk my digital slr when Im out on salt water.   Ive hesitated a lot before buying a waterproof camera because their quality for the price has always seemed less.  I finally bit the bullet on this camera because of the 5x optical zoom and the ability to take macro pictures from 1 cm away. Unlike the olympus underwater camera this takes SD cards - I couldnt see buying an xD card.   This camera is capable of taking beautiful photos, the 1 cm macro is fun - shove my camera into a flower and see what I get. 
 
Negatives so far:
- Lots of noise in low light, especially when zoomed in
- I dont like that theres not a cover that closes over the lens when you turn off the camera.  It means you should definitely have a dedicated case for it.
- Optical image stabilization would have been a great addition to this camera.   

I bought the kata snapshot D camera case for the camera and it fits well:

<Content> Because of serious spray I needed a waterproof camera with a wide angle lens for an August 11 trip to Niagara Falls (Slowly I turned..). I saw the Pentax Optio W60 on Amazon with an expected release date of August 5 so I was preparing to settle for the W30. Then, while surfing the site it came up as in stock on July 10. I immediately ordered it with Super Saver shipping and had it in my hands by noon on July 16. This was way faster than I had hoped for. I spent the next 11 hours studying it and the manual.

 The manual is 240 pages, all in English, soI am not going to bore you with a list of features. You can see them for yourself on the Amazon and Pentax web sites. What I will say is that the pictures I took while learning the camera last night were excellent. If this camera does not meet all your needs in a point and shoot camera then its unlikely anything will.  It definitely meets my needs. Its waterproof and shockproof and has a 5X zoom (28-140, 35mm equivalent) as well as 5.7X digital zoom and movie mode with zoom and sound.

 My only suggestion, at this time, would be that the battery compartment door latch button could be a little more substantial. You will need an extra D-LI78 battery or its higher mah equivalent. The supplied battery is only 680mah.

 I spoke with Paul at Pentax customer service. His recommendation was that there was no need to spend extra for class 4 or class 6 SD cards, class 2 cards would be fine. Because of built-in camera hardware limitations I would only gain minimal write speed with class 4 or 6 cards. I did as he suggested and the write speed is very fast with the class 2 (standard) Sandisk cards. 
 
 As a former photo retailer with over 20 years experience in camera sales I feel safe when I say BUY THIS CAMERA! You will not be disappointed.</Content>

<Content>This is the 4th waterproof digital camera Ive owned.  With its SW line, Olympus has marketed itself as the manufacturer of the most robust point and shoot cameras.  In my experience, however, this camera is no more robust than those made by competitors (most notably Pentax, but others including Canon have now also entered this niche).  And it has a lot of annoyances to keep me from recommending it:

Pros: 
1. Fast - very little shutter lag. Allows reasonably sharp action photos, especially in sport mode.
2. Decent battery time
3. Fairly rugged lcd
4. Self-retracting lens cover protects underlying glass
5. Adequate picture quality
6. Fair video quality for a point and shoot (though see reservations below).

Cons:
1. Contrasty images with blown highlights in full sun
2. Need to go through the special shooting mode menu every time you turn the camera on somewhat negates the speed advantage of sport mode - a significant consideration for a camera that is intended to be used for fun and sun
3. Proprietary memory card (xD made by Olympus) limited to 2gb, meaning less capacity.  Competing cameras use SD card which are less expensive, enjoy use in a wide variety of electronic devices, and available  up to 32gb.  (xD cards from other companies - if you can find them - wont support full length video, nor will the even more awkward microSD card, which requires an adapter).  Furthermore, all but a few card readers on the market dont work with xD cards, so youll have to keep your camera cable handy to download.  The lower capacity of xD means more frequent downloads (especially if you shoot videos very often, and because most card readers wont recognize xD cards you will need to keep you camera cable handy.  And if your camera fails with pictures left on the card youll have to buy a compatible card reader to ever see them.
3. Batteries of previous Oly SW cameras wont work in this one, if youre thinking of upgrading.
4. Not that robust: leaked the very first (and only) time I snorkeled with it in salt water, though I was not close to its depth limit.  Oly did repair it under warranty, but the process was by no means seamless. (With the camera was a sheet that stated there was a depth meter - barometer - built into the camera confirming that warranty terms had not been violated, something I dont recall seeing in the manual).  The camera does not, in my experience, live up to its specifications and is not more shockproof or waterproof than competing models from other manufacturers.  Consider an extended warranty.
5. The tiny icons on the mode selection wheel - there are 8 of them - wear off with use.  Mine are no longer legible, and the warranty repair did not address this.
6. Unfortunate lens placement in the upper right hand corner of the camera body. Even after taking a couple thousand pictures with this camera, I still occasionally catch a part of one of the fingers of my steadying left hand in the image.  Overall ergonomics of this camera rate a C+ making it hard to shoot with one hand (in my case this is important as I am frequently holding a kayak paddle in the other).  My favorite in this regard was Sonys DSC U-60, long since discontinued.</Content>

<Content>I just upgraded to the Olympus Stylus 1030SW from the Olympus Stylus 770SW, and Im definitely glad I did.  This one has everything I loved about the 770 plus some improvements.

Olympus fixed the 2 biggest problems I had with the 770.  First being that the only button that can power on the 1030 is the actual power button.  On the 770, both the play button and the mode button could also power on the camera, which leads to drained batteries when theyre easily hit accidentally while in your pocket.  

The other big problem that was fixed was the addition of the mode wheel (is that even what its actually called?).  On the 770, I was always annoyed that if I wanted to switch to movie mode or one of the other scene modes from auto, I had to hit the mode button twice, select video (or whatever else I wanted), and then hit enter.  Having a new baby and enjoying taking still pictures and video, its nice to now be able to switch very quickly just by turning the wheel between still and video.

What Ive always loved about Olympus cameras and still holds up here, is that theyre well built.  Ive used a lot of friends cameras that are other brands (wont mention any specifically), and a lot of them just feel really cheap and easily breakable.  This camera is sturdy and with the added benefit of being waterproof, shockproof, and crushproof (all up to a certain point obviously), I never worry about accidentally breaking it.  I know it can take a beating and still go strong.

I wont complain about picture quality, as I think its just fine.  Is it as good as my SLR?  No, but I dont expect it to be.  This camera does everything I want it to do and the quality is very good.

I wanted to get the camera in black, but ended up with green since for some reason theres an almost 200 dollar difference.  Looking at the pictures, I wasnt crazy about the green but wasnt about to pay so much more just for a difference in color.  I was pleasantly surprised when I received the camera that the green looks much better in person than it does in the photo.  I actually really like the green now, much more than the silver that I had the 770 in.

I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a point and shoot that you can take absolutely anywhere!</Content>

<Content>I have the black version of this camera and I have loved using it. I have put it through a lot and tried it in many different conditions and it has been great. The only drawbacks are the minimal zoom, the fact that it does not have zoom while in video mode, and the color panel (in my case, black) on the front has gotten really scratched. The black has been scratched away in places to reveal the silver camera underneath. I wish I had known about this scratch problem because I would have chosen the silver camera instead.
Overall, I am very pleased with this camera and it works perfectly with the recommended 2G chip. Holds tons of pictures and videos.</Content>

<Content>Most reviewers purchased this product for the same reasons and have had the same experiences.  They want an abuse-proof and/or waterproof camera (probably have kids, too) and, yes, the pictures are good but not as good as their old Canon that was crushed or dropped.

Same for me. I had (2) Canons, one dropped with the lens extended, the other forgotten in my bathing suit mesh pocket.  My 8 mega-pixel Canon SD870-IS took consistently clearer, richer photos than this one.  By a wide margin? No, but its noticeable when browsing my photo library.

Where this camera excels is in its durability and I suspect most folks requiring this functionality will end up purchasing something in the Stylus SW line.  Ironically, it hasnt been dropped yet, but its gotten dirty, wet, and dusty.  I no longer have to obsess about seeing or imagining motes of dust in the lens.  This camera is air-tight and I like that the lens is fixed.  Best part is that the directions tell you to clean the camera under running water.  Nice.

I went in the pool with this camera for 20 minutes and followed the included wet-care instructions and didnt encounter the problems claimed by other reviewers.  That doesnt mean theyre not true -- maybe the camera was defective or the environment subjected to the camera was more severe.

As for camera performance, well its OK.  Im not going to go into technical details but 1) I experience a lot of white, bleached faces with the auto setting and 2) occasional inconsistent flash leading to image blurring.  Image stabilization for low-light photography is ho-hum and certainly inferior to the beloved Canon. 

Some elements that are top-notch for a pointshoot though (and exceed my Canon):
- Camera takes wonderful panoramic photos with auto-stitching on the fly.  A dummy could use it and get seamless images.
- High-speed photos in manual-mode look great
- A plethora of useful presets such as available light, candlelight, and cuisine
- Macro mode takes stunning pics with LED flash options 

Now to movie mode which is now quite decent. There used to be *so* many caveats with movie length and what memory cards are compatible with what movie mode that arent worth mentioning.  Suffice it to say that there have been major improvements in the latest firmware version 1.1.  Read on:

- With an Olympus xD TypeM+ or TypeH card you can record movies (640x480, 30fps) up to the full capacity of the card (max xD card size is still 2GB I think). However, a single movie cant exceed 29 minutes.

- Lameness still exists when using micro SDHC or non M+/H xD cards.  640x480, 30fps is still limited to 10 seconds (??).  However, 4GB+ mSDHC cards are now supported for movie-mode full card capacity *although* only in 320x240.  Single movie length is likewise limited to 29 minutes.

Bottom line: download and install the firmware from the Olympus site.

Last but not least, (2) final things:
1) Regular usb cables arent compatible with Olympus devices so add another cable to detangle from the spaghetti.
2) Why, oh why is Olympus still using xD memory cards? The fact that these cameras support micro SDHC cards with an adapter is just a sign that xD has limited time on this planet.  Theyre trailing in capacity, more expensive, and larger.  I made sure I ordered an 8GB microSDHC SanDisk card with this camera.  I only use the 2GB xD M+ when I know Im going to be recording a movie and dont feel like bringing a camcorder (note to self: buy a Flip HD).   

In summary:
- 5 stars, Durability
- 3 stars, General, auto-mode photo quality vs. Canon
- 4 stars, Camera functionality
- 3 stars, Movie functionality

- This camera looks great - sexy comes to mind but I didnt say it.  Canon has the waterproof, shock-resistant D10 but it looks bubbly, like a Fisher Price kid camera.
- For features/price this camera wins over the Olympus Stylus Tough 8000. With that model you pay a price premium for the 2 extra mega-pixels.  Otherwise everything else is identical even down to the image processor.</Content>

<Content>I had high expectations of this camera due to the price.  I loved the solid build and tough box construction.  But the photos disappointed me over and over again.  I have bought Canon Elph Powershot cameras for over (5) years because they take unbelievable, high quality photographs.  Long story short - I returned it and purchased a 10 megapixel Canon at Sams Club.  The other issue is that X-D cards are expensive and not always compatible with universal card readers, especially on laptop computers.</Content>

<Content>Ive had this camera for almost a year now. I agree with other reviewers that the picture quality leaves something to be desired. However, when you want to take a photograph underwater or when climbing a mountain an ok picture is certainly better than no picture. So long if the camera works as advertised.

This camera had worked well in cold environments and underwater for the first several months of ownership. When snorkeling in just a couple feet of water around month 7 of ownership it died. Olympus repaired the camera, but now that its out of its warranty period Im hesitant to take it underwater again...

Perhaps I was unlucky and got stuck with a dud, but Im contemplating switching to the Panasonic TS1 even though its not rated for the same depths, and isnt freezeproof. Reasons:
 
a) the Panny supposedly has better picture/video quality, 
b) Ive generally had good luck with Panasonic products in general
c) Im not confident that my 1030SW could survive in 30 feet of water (Ive never taken it that deep) given it failed in two feet. So I might as well go with something that is rated for less depth

Having said that, it sounds like the fine print on the Panny TS1 has all sorts of disclaimers about the shock and waterproof guarantee.

As for the Canon D10, it doesnt match up with the Panny in PQ and, as Gizmodo put it, The D10 looks like it was designed by Ringo on the set of Yellow Submarine--its bulbous shell and porthole-like screws drive home the fact that this baby is going underwater. But on land, itll be tough to fit it into a pants pocket without some serious bulging.

Bottom line: the Adventure camera segment still needs some work. 

For peace of mind I wish a store like REI, with a total customer satisfaction guarantee, would carry these types of cameras. Until then heres to hoping that the manufacturers build a better product and/or extended warranty program.

<Content>On my last trip to Hawaii, I bought a few of those disposable underwater cameras for my snorkel trips.  I was very disappointed to discover over half of the pictures were useless.  This was bright light underwater.

So for my second trip, I decided I was going to research some different cameras.  I discovered this Olympis 1030SW.  While it has some mixed reports on picture quality I took a chance.

I was very pleasantly surprised.  I took pictures with this camera that the disposable camera could not capture.  I found some of the really bright pictures on the beach did not come out right, but with further manipulation, I was able to get good results.  Most the problem is learning curve figuring out what scene or mode to use in the camera.  I also got some very nice movie footage of dolphins.  I pretty much took the camera out without reading the manual.  So I only captured the movies in 15fps, but found out that you can change the quality to 30fps.  

The operations and menus are not too difficult to figure out.

For the price, Im not sure there is a better camera for sports activities.  The compact size is great.

The biggest disappointment is probably the zoom magnification, but its something I can live with for this type of camera.  On your next active vacation, take a look at the Olympus.</Content>

<Content>I purchased this camera at a friends recommendation in advance of a cruise vacation. I looked forward to using the waterproof feature. I carefully read the directions and followed them -- but when I used the camera underwater (not more than a foot underwater), the camera stopped working. I was extremely disappointed that a brand new camera was ruined, and that I did not then have a camera available for the rest of my trip. 

The friend that recommended the camera to me travelled with me on the same trip, and was successful in using her camera underwater -- but apparently there is some inconsistency in production of this camera that makes it less than completely reliable.</Content>

<Content>Same as most everyone else, after a week, my camera just stopped functioning, and looking inside I found water, corroded battery points, etc. I did recover the pictures and plenty had water spots (condensation) blocking the images--Im bummed.
   If I were to buy one now, Id only purchase at a bricks and mortar store of repute, because there is a good chance youll be bringing it back. Then, Once home, test it rigorously for a week--get it underwater at least a few feet for a half hour to test out the seals...before you take it on your once-in-a-lifetime vacation. I believe that they cant ALL be as bad as mine...but you better test it and make sure when you are still in warrantee, etc. (A spritz of water is not a test--leave it in the bathtub overnight--the seals need to feel some water pressure. good luck!</Content>

<Content>I love all the features this camera has, Im not going to get into them because you already know them if you are reading the reviews.

The fast start up is great but if you are in Scene mode you must press the OK button before you can take pictures.

The biggest thing for me is that the slowest shutter speed that I can get is 1/4 sec at f3.5. This doesnt work in super low light situations and is frustrating. I realize that most point and shoot users just turn on the flash, while the flash has a time and place it isnt always the best choice.

You will notice that despite the fast shutter speed I still gave the camera 5 stars. I love it!</Content>

I was sorting through my old stuff and found some old 35 mm Kodak Advantix film, took it to get it developed, and the picture quality was much better than anything Ive every seen with either one of my Olympus cameras.

In summary a 35 mm camera takes much better pictures... I thought I would opt for the Canon 40D later on, but I might be going back to film. </Content>

<Content>I have had the Olympus Stylus 1030SW for almost a year.  It is a great camera for the active traveler.  It is small and rugged.  Use it at the water parks, snorkeling, diving, and at the pool.  You do not need to worry about kids dropping it.  It is shockproof.  It can go down under water 33 feet.  Take it along snow skiing or on a tabogan ride.  This camera can take a beating and it will keep on going strong.  The quality of the pictures are great.  It is not a portrait camera so do not expect that feature.  It can do everything else.</Content>

<Content>We bought this camera new to take on a snorkeling trip and were quite happy with the results, considering that we were learning to snorkel and to use the camera at the same time. While we could not always see what we were shooting, due to reflections on the viewing screen, we got some great shots. We used a tape-on automagic filter to compensate for the blue-tinted underwater light. Once a few drops of water got into the card area; this may have occurred because one of our snorkels lasted more than an hour. After that, the camera became erratic and refused to record photos to the card (meaning that we got an error screen and could not take any more photos). I suggest being more careful about not using the camera underwater for more than an hour.  Otherwise, it was great to have a small, easy-to-use point-and-shoot underwater.</Content>

<Content>Ive had this camera for about a week now and have been very happy with it. Its a little bigger than some of my previous cameras, but seems to be made well and is sturdy.
PROS
- built solid
- large, vivid screen
- intuitive controls
- waterproof (see below)
- no protruding lens (everything stays flat)
CONS 
- a bit heavy (has to be to be sturdy, I guess)
- lens is in upper corner instead of center (keep getting my finger in the way)
- USB cable is proprietary - standard cables wont work
- uses XD cards (although it shipped with a MicroSD adapter)

Dont let the CONs fool you - I like this camera!  Once I learn to hold it with my finger out of the way of the lens, it will be smooth sailing. As for waterproofness - the jury is still out on that one.  Olympus claims it is waterproof to 33 feet, but in view of the small seals and gaskets, I dont think Id do that.  I own a Nikonos and thats what I feel a true waterproof camera should look like.  The Olympus should be good for being caught in the rain, and perhaps an occasional soaking in a wet gear bag, though.</Content>

<Content>I absolutely love this camera.  I bought one and loved it so much, I bought a second one.  Let me first say that I made this purchase looking for a rugged camera.  I have a very nice digital SLR that I use if I want to make a poster-sized print or churn out professional quality work.  I think this camera produces pictures of very respectable quality considering this is the most ruggedly awesome camera ever.

I can toss this camera in my motorcycles tank bag without having to worry if it starts raining.  I can take amazing pictures in and around water that I would never risk with my other camera.  I love the panorama feature at places like the Grand Canyon.  It takes up a fraction of the space of my SLR, and I dont have to worry about dropping it.  I typically stick to cameras that take AA or AAA batteries, but I made an exception with this camera and it is completely worth it.

Ive read a lot of reviews from people who were unhappy with certain aspects of the camera (such a picture quality).  If you are looking for spectacular photo quality, you may want to keep looking.  If you are looking for a camera that can survive just about anything you can throw at it and still give you really good photo quality, this is the camera for you.</Content>

<Content>Ive owned this for almost a year now and I love it.  Im not a huge shutterbug and cant speak intelligently on high-end photo quality.  However, I need a camera that takes good pictures while standing up to anything my life throws at it, and this one fits the bill.  This camera has survived multiple hiking trips, being dropped by my three-year old, and exposure to saltwater on multiple occasions.  I have had this camera in my pocket while parachuting into the ocean...twice.  A quick rinse in the sink afterward is all that is required.  Throughout all the abuse I have thrown its way, the camera works great with only a couple of small cosmetic scratches.  Im very pleased with the photos it takes, being purely of a point-and-shoot variety.  The video is limited to 10 second clips when set to the high resolution mode but unlimited when set to the lower resolution.  Its not of the quality you would see in a dedicated video camera but its great when something video-worthy happens right in front of you.

The bad:
The USB jack on the camera is a NON-STANDARD USB plug, unlike any I have ever seen before.  This requires me to pack an additional cord with me rather than use the same USB cable that I use with my other USB devices.  Or, I can just take out the XD card and use the card reader on my laptop.  Also, this camera is quite heavy when compared to others in its size range.  This is due to the tough construction and waterproofing and makes the cameras weight very noticeable when carried in a shirt pocket.  I think the weight penalty is worth it, but its worth noting.

<Content>I purchased this to be the camera I could finally just stick in my pocket or pack and be gone.  No other has been able to take the abuse.  And its very, very good, including features and optional on-camera guides to effects.

The problems have to do with use as a travelling camera.  One cannot download pictures without their special computer to camera cord.  Looks like a mini-USB, isnt, and you cant take pictures and process on a friends laptop without dragging that around also.  When one is travelling light carrying the cord is a nuisance.  Its in the way and weighs.

An out would have been having an SD card instead of their proprietary memory card.  Their card cannot be read by anything found in the course of normal human events.  Bluetooth would have been nice.

Great item as long as one wants it only for short jaunts and doesnt plan on processing any photos without dragging along that proprietary cord.  Or a reader of some type for their memory card.</Content>

<Content> this is the best camera that i had

This camera offers strong features for a take it anywhere camera - water PROOF (to 30 feet) drop proof (to 6 feet) and dust proof. After a month of dragging it everywhere, I think the claims are real. Ive gotten it soaked, dropped it, and been in wind-blown dirt without any damage or crud appearing on my shots. 

The camera also offers numerous metering modes for shooting. The auto exposure is current with todays best camera that i had. Once you learn the menu system, you can get a good shot almost anywhere, and the default setting works well almost anywhere. 

 
1. There is NO finder window, you MUST use the view screen to frame your shot. Its awkward for those of us accustomed to a view finder. But Ive learned...
2. The menus are not complex, but there are a lot of options. There are settings that work for instant shots. But for more challenging situations there are great options - especially useful is the portrait flash options that let you highlight a face while not losing the background. It actually works as advertised. 
3. The lens is limited in aperture. This type of camera does not let you stop down to f/11 for that perfect depth of field shot. You are shooting around f/5 and changing the exposure time as you select different settings. What it sees is what you get. 
4. Its small. I have several great shots -- that feature my finger over the left 1/3 of the lens. 
5. it has the usual metering delay of PS - so you cant take a TRULY instant shot - but there IS a feature called SHOOTSELECT - which takes about 8 shots in motor drive mode - you then pick one or more that you want to keep. (you must do it NOW - before going on to the next shot, and it does take a moment for them to save.) But for action shots of kids, its fun and works well.

<Content>I used my 1030 SW as backup for a digital SLR during a once in a lifetime cruise through the Galapagos. Picture quality good for PS; after 4 one hour trips in the water, the camera failed.  It turned on and off, but would not take pictures and the LCD screen did not work.  I am sending it back for replacement.  Its a great idea for a go anywhere do anything camera, but it did not stand up to what I consider minor water exposure.  Others have had better experience, but I had not warning of potential crash. </Content>

<Content>Bought this camera for our 12 day adventure trip to Costa Rica. Camera stopped working after day 6. Was extra careful to check all seals before using in water. After one day of canyonering and rappeling down waterfalls, another day of zip lining in the rain, some light use in the pool and a brief moment in the ocean it died. LCD went dead and camera was full of water. Camera was never more that a foot or two under water. Looked like the water had been in there for a while too since it came out green colored and the battery contact points were corroded. Have not even had a chance to see how the 300 or more pictures I took came out. Hopefully I can retrieve the pics from the M card.  It looks like a sealed unit and is not corroded. Guy on our canyoneering trip noticed the camera and mentioned that he bought the same one for his trip as well and it died 6 days after he was using it in the ocean for surfing shots. Very disapointed.  I am now past the 14 day return policy date too. Looks like the fun is just beginning on this purchase. Will add more details after I try to resolve this issue.</Content>

I kept this one- no doubt the Lumix is the better build quality, but I felt like I was going to break it. This one isnt quite as good as the Lumix in image, but dam I dropped it like 3 times so far and the pictures are still pretty good. Great for when your in the shower with that special someone too wink,wink.

<Content>For the most part this is a good camera. I bought it for its durability and compactness. The photos are quality, the camera is easy to use and it has a lot of nice photo options. Panarama mode is not perfect, but nice. You can edit photos right on the camera. This was a great purchase for what I wanted...a good second camera for extreme winter conditions. My complaints are the following: Battery life: By the end of the day, I was already getting a message battery was low...disappointment when you have to ration your photo selection. Speed of use: When you are in the SCN mode, everytime you turn the camera on, you have to confirm that you want that setting. I kept the camera in Landscape mode and everytime I turned it on, I had to answer yes I wanted to be in that mode. Also, any changes I made to this setting (like light balance), I had to reset every time I turned the camera on. Also, the flip open cover is nice, but it easily slides open and turns the camera on as you slide it into your pocket.

Dont get me wrong. I am satisfied with the camera all around, these are minor complaints (except battery life).</Content>

The options for taking different types of pictures are numerous, but if you are able to take good care of your camera, you dont really need to add the option that makes it able to endure 220lbs of force.  The zoom option is also not too significant, if you really like taking close-ups from far away, I suggest a different model.</Content>

Works great in water.  Takes good photos, but youll have to change some settings around to get it perfect.  Setting it to auto usually doesnt produce the best pictures.

<Content>For a point and shoot, this camera is great.  I highly reccommend this as far as point and shoots go and a Canon SLR Digital if you are looking for zoom and the highest quality digital pics.
PROS:
- Practically indestructable (I throw in my back pocket all the time, take it fishing, have used it under water and have had zero problems). I havent tried freezing it, but I have dropped it a time or two).
- No lens telescopes out, so I can get pictures when people arent expecting it, so it makes for funny off-guard pics.
- Very Clear Pictures
- I like the sunset function. Ill try going back and posting a photo I took with it in this function.
- Have had multiple compliments on the Stainless Finish

CONS: 
- Short delay in pushing down on button and the camera taking the pic, but probably no worse than any other camera in this price range
- Zooming capability is not there, but again, its a point-and-shoot so I was looking for more durability and small size to carry around with me. 
- I need to discover how to save battery life.  It runs out quickly.
- Does not use standard memory cards.  You have to buy the Olympus ones.

OVERALL: Great buy for the price, my friend has the model with fewer megapixels and convinced me to purchase this one for the waterproof aspect and I am glad I did.  We both like ours a lot.

<Content>This is a great pocket camera. period. it shoots fabulous pictures, great video... oh and it never leaves your pocket so its always available. 

That was my biggest complaint with my other fancier cameras. Id bring this expensive, cool camera on vacation and then because i was going to the beach Id leave it in the hotel... or bring it with and have a friend watch it while we went in the ocean. I hated that.

Now I stick the camera in my pocket, we went horseback riding, swimming in the pool (took underwater shots), lounging on the beach, kayaking, deep sea fishing, and swimming in the ocean (took underwater and in/out of water shots there too). Yeah!

I have shots of all of that from our adventures so far... not to mention great distance shots from a hike into the snow and a Mirror Lake.

I cant say enough great things.

Is it a $1000 Digital SLR with $1000 interchangeable lenses? Nope. One of my great friends is a pro photographer, so I occasionally get to play with her toys and her glass... amazing. But convenience and always having it available for shots is more important to me. Will I buy an expensive, awesome Digital SLR... probably...but I still wont get rid of my waterproof great pocket shooter.

Id recommend getting two of the xD cards (I have 2x2Gig). I went for the Olympus brand so I could use their panoramic feature... however to date Ive never used it. I use Google Picasa or Windows Live Photo Gallery to do my panoramic photo collage creations with no special hardware. I also bought two batteries for convenience... although this thing is incredible on batteries (IMHO).

One last thing. Im a scuba diver too. I bought the Olympus case that fits this camera for diving and took it down to Mexico. Worked like a charm and a friend just borrowed it for their trip to Kona. Goes down to 140. (Note: as will all diving camera setups, good maintenance, condensation packs, and a final check on that O ring should keep you out of trouble.)

Enjoy!</Content>

Im not very techno-savvy, though, so a lot of my pictures in low light come out really fuzzy.  It might just be that I have it on some of the wrong settings, but it seems to me that I got better low-light pictures from my previous camera, which I broke by dropping too many times.

The 1030SW is absolutely awesome.  It is SOOOOO much more user friendly than the other one I had and it takes much better pictures and video.  Adjusting the settings to best fit lighting and movement is idiot proof.  PLUS....its freeze proof, water proof, dust proof and impact resistant!  Which makes it PERFECT for snowboarding, snorkling, four wheeling, paragliding, surfing, swimming...you name it!  It is the BEST camera available for adventurous people who love an adrenaline rush....it is the only camera that can keep up with me :-)</Content>

<Content>Ive always leaving 4,5 stars reveiws, and there is a reason I think 1030 sw sucks.

I bought a refurbished one on Amazon on Oct 27,2008; and I first seen this camera when hiking with my friend in New Hampshire last winter, I heavily relied on the customer reviews on Amazon to make a decision (was going to by a canon SD), and somehow I pretty set up my mind in buying one so I just ignored the negative reviews and think they either got a lemon or they dont know how to shoot a good picture.

And this Thanksgiving my friend came from Detriot to Boston and brought his Canon 1100is, we went to Boston, Harvard University and took a trip to Ipswich which is a beautiful town north of Boston. I wasnt trying to compare anything but just copied all our photos into one folder and boy was I surprised.

ALL  EVERY picture that was taken by my $300 something camera was noisy and not focused well, while pictures taken by canon were way better. My friend tried to convince me that my investment was good but even he can tell the huge difference, all the details, focus are lost with this olympus SW 1030 camera. I know how to shoot good pictures and I am so pissed that I spend 300 bucks on this high-end camera and it takes lousy pictures.

I was upgrade from a Canon A610 and bought my girlfriend a Canon SD 900, I moved to Olympus because I read an article said that they had a very good DSLR E520, so I figure the SW 1030 should be good, and also I do lots of hiking, mountaineering and sea kayaking, its just the picture quality is too bad to tolerate, its far worse than my 3-year-old A 610.

Dont say I am not buying the right camera because this camera is good for waterproof, shockproof and all that things. Of course I love those features but I love good quality too!!!!!!!!! If you think quality matters than dont buy this camera, believe me or not you will find out yourself.

Ive sold mine after Thanksgiving plus the extra 60 bucks I spend on the cases, xD cards, I am thinking of moving to a canon sd 990 but dont have the money now, Ill just wait for the price drop on sd 990.</Content>

<Content>I got this camera a few months ago to have a rugged camera that I could use at the beach and stick in my pocket.  I had a Canon Powershot SD600 before that had been ruined by beach spray.  Previous to that I had an Olympus Camedia D-560 Zoom in college which had been abused thoroughly and survived 5 years and mutliple countries.  I was disappointed with the Canon as it was so delicate so I decided to switch back to Olympus.

To summarize...  This camera is well below average.  I have tried using it in a variety of settings and all have been subpar.  I waited to write a review after a few months, thinking I might be able to work out the kinks - but after a wonderful Thanksgiving - I felt I must mention this cameras inadequacies: 

1. The camera takes rather blurry pictures when it should not - its pot luck - some turn out alright, many do not.  There is a setting that is supposed to eliminate this problem, but it does not.
2. I like simple cameras that dont require me to adjust the setting for any moment.  This camera doesnt allow that so when a moment strikes -pictures often come out either overexposed, blurry, or grainy.  Ridiculous for a camera of this price.
2. The movies are absolutely terrible - seriously, I could probably draw a flipbook better than the movies this thing takes.  I was amazed how absolutely horrible the movies are after my previous two cameras - one 3.2MP and the other 6.0MP.  I realize this is not a camcorder, but its nice being able to take brief movies when the moment arises - as my old Canon was able to.

Overall - I am very dissapointed with this camera.  I have not used the underwater capabilities but have let my 3 year old niece use it to see how rugged it is.  Actually thats the best thing so far - I have no worries that shell break it and dont really care if she does.

Back to Canon now.....</Content>

<Content>I wont go over all the points  features others have already covered well. So Ill just quickly note I am very happy with this camera. It doesnt have the best lens by any means or the strongest zoom, but it is amazingly waterproof.  We used it in the ocean snorkeling as well as in the pool taking various shots and videos. Worked like a charm.  

You do have to play with the numerous settings and modes to get some pictures to look just right -- especially in lowlight situations. (Daylight pictures were no problem.)  I found some night pics didnt always come out so well and it was very much a matter of trial  error to get them to work, so be sure to practice before trying to take pictures of an important event, trip or moment. Also the flash is not the strongest either so be sure your main subject(s) are fairly close and pretty much forget about the background showing up if its any real distance away.  The panorama function worked really well in just about every situation and the camera can even stitch the images together for you itself and you can see the results in a few seconds.

The camera fits nicely in the pocket of your shirt or pants. The charger will charge the battery fully in about an hour or so.  We also bought the orange flotation strap which did keep the camera from sinking in water.  Its a good, solid all purpose camera which we had a lot of fun using.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera specifically to take pictures snorkeling in Fiji.  I had used it in the rain and it was fine.  Minute I tried to take a picture underwater (less than 1m down, and it should be good to 10m) it broke.  Water leaked into the body, ruining the card and battery.  Thankfully it was a new card and I didnt lose any pictures.
I am NOT the only one this happened to.  Another woman at the resort I was at had the exact same camera and it broke the exact same way.  I, now camera-less and complaining about it, met three other people who had similar problems.  Everyone who has one of the 700s or the 850 has no problems.  But the 1030 is faulty.
Thankfully, the camera was under warranty and it was repaired and the battery and card were replaced.  I still wont trust it underwater however.  Im going to buy it a case.</Content>

<Content>I got this camera for taking on trips outdoors. I wanted something small that was water proof. Everything works well and the pictures during a sunny day are great. When there is less light, it suffers a bit. 

Auto mode picture taking is ok but I wish there were manual modes. It is tough to get the picture I want at night.

ISO 400 and above is grainier than other compact cameras.

The pictures are a bit soft but reproducible to nice prints.

Water proof in the surf. You should definitely give it a fresh water rinse after use. Make sure that there is no sand in the lens cover. I heard that it would get stuck but I have not experienced this yet.

It is a bit heavy for the size but it is really heavy duty I suppose for the impact resistance.

XD cards are a little more expensive but it comes with an adapter to use micro SD cards. You can get 2gb micro SD for $7.99. This will allow for some serious pictures but make sure you have an extra battery to fill the card.

Video mode only does 10 seconds at the higher frames per second mode which sucks but the XD-m and other newer XD-h allow for longer videos in the higher resolution modes. Ten seconds is ok because we dont do to much video with the camera. You can get more time at the 15 frames per second mode at 640x480 if needed. I will get some XD-m+ cards later for video at the highest rating later. It is just cool to be filming a video while surfing and in the tube action vid.

Battery power is pretty good and sustains at prescribed projections by Olympus.

Overall I really like this camera but there are little things that make it so I cant give it 5 stars so it gets 4. For a point and shoot in swamps of Mexico, deserts of the Mojave, Oceans of the pacific kayaking or surfing, and at the size it comes in and with an optional floating camera strap, it is a great camera for $280. The floating strap was $15 which was pretty good. It would really suck if it was dropped and sank to the bottom of the ocean while surfing or snorkeling.

I have a Canon SD300 that takes way better quality pictures because of the manual modes, but it is very fragile. I broke 2 of them but good thing I purchased the warranty. This is a dry land camera and the size is great but not water proof. When I take this out to the beach, the salt air affects it and seems to clog it up. I have a water proof box for it but it is big and bulky. The 1030sw is the ultimate outdoors person camera. There is a pentax optio that is water proof but it is a bit bigger. Size is a big concern for us being we need something small and stealthy to fit in our gear.
I also have an older Olympus C-3020 that takes awesome pictures and has more of a manual mode. Of course the lens is bigger and the pictures at 3.2 megapixels are crisper. This camera is pretty big and it tough to take around hiking on trips. It still works really well.

When I got this 1030sw from Amazon, I should have ordered the accessories with it but forgot until later. They shipped really fast and I was pretty happy about it.

I would recommend this camera for anybody that is into outdoors h20 sports or the likes, but be aware of the camera not allowing for full manual mode. It is just a small compact point and shoot camera built tough.

4 stars given - If olympus fixed and added the things that were addressed here, they could sell a ton of these and would warrant 5 stars plus.

Have fun shopping for your camera :)</Content>

<Content>WHat an amazing camera! The video quality is great, picture quality is excellent. I recently took this camera on a 7-day cruise where I knew I would be snorkeling and spend most of my time underwater. I was afraid at first to get the baby wet...but it handles like a pro. My advice....USE THE DIFFERENT SETTINGS!!!!! They really made a difference between shooting landscapes, on the beach, in the water etc. I dropped this camera several times  with not a single problem. it just works.... If you plan on shooting alot of video clips, I would recommend the special 2GB M type video card (it was less than $15 on amazon) Is also recommend the floating wriststrap, which came in very handy  while swimming....and yes it keeps the camera from sinking!). I cant tell you how many people were asking me about my camera...they were so envious that I could take great digital photos without some bulky plastic camera housing!

Pros:

DURABLE ...this thing took a beating
Great pre-settings for different conditions
Love the thumb wheel to toggle between camera and video and the Guide
big LCD screen
great mic quality when taking video
very sleek/slim design
worth every damn penny if you live outdoors!
came with mini SD card adapter


Cons:

Wrist strap doesnt tighten to wrist ( i just took one off an older camera)
LCD screen is hard to see in sunny conditions ( but thats with every LCD camera)</Content>

<Content>As far as Im concerned, this is the optimal camera. It has all the features Ive come to rely on with a point and shoot (video, image stabilization, autofocus, even 3x zoom) but also is waterproof and shockproof! I had no worries letting my 5 year old cousin use it unsupervised, there wasnt much she could do to it except maybe lose it. My favorite feature is the rapid fire mode, were I can take several pictures a second when trying to capture just the right frame. 
The only thing I miss is having a view finder. But actually so far I havent been in a situation when the LED screen hasnt been sufficent to take a shot. Its just when I hand it to someone unfamiliar with digital cameras that it ever was an issue.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera to replace my old powershot SD700, which broke when it was dropped onto a carpeted floor from a height of maybe 4 feet.  Overall, Im happy with the Olympus, but it falls short of my SD700 in a few areas.

Pros:
- The Olympus is smaller than I expected.  It fits easily into my pocket and is not cumbersome to carry around on backpacking trips, for example.
- This thing is durable.  You can feel the sturdiness.  I added a screen protector from bestskinsever, and now I feel like its indestructible.  I never worry about it.
- It does a great job with macros (close-ups).  It even has a special macro mode that uses a small, built-in LED to light your subject.  Very nice feature.
- It has an impressive zoom; better than the 3X of my old SD700.
- It has an impressively high-res CCD: 10.1MP; again, better than my old SD700.

Cons:
- My old SD700 still took better pictures.  I cant think of a way to quantify this qualitative observation, but I think its true.  I recently went on a backpacking trip and my buddy brought his camera, which happened to be an SD700.  We took pictures of the same scenery, but the Fall colors looked more vibrant through his camera.  Images also seem...sharper with the SD700, despite the megapixel advantage of the Olympus.  Maybe someone who knows more about cameras could explain this.
- There are a handful of different acquisition settings on the Olympus, but navigating to them is not very intuitive and definitely not very fast.  
- Theres no real manual control of things like shutter speed, etc.

I use this camera for all of my outdoor activities: backpacking, snowboarding, climbing, and trips to the beach.  Thats what this thing was made for, and it feels good to carry it around in my pocket or toss it into my gear bag without worrying about it breaking like my other cameras.  The pictures it takes are good enough for me, but are out-shined even by older, cheaper cameras of the same size.  If you get this camera, youll like it.  Just keep in mind that youre paying quite a premium for durability.</Content>

<Content>Im still not sure if Im in love with this camera enough to justify the price.  Two little things I havent liked...1) the battery life is too short.  Would strongly recommend the purchase of at least one spare battery, I will probably purchase two.  I took it on vacation  was only shooting about 100 pictures a day on 3MG and I was loosing the battery by the end of the day; 2) the response time in between pictures is a little slower than I would have liked.  
Some positives:  The camera has a lot of scene selections  specialty modes that allowed me to get a few pictures that in the past I would not have gotten with a point  shoot -- like shooting into backlighting.  I didnt have to worry about it getting wet on rainy days or if I dropped or bumped it so that was nice.  The picture quality was good, I took most on 3mg  a few on 10mg.  I loved the size...slipped easily into my pocket.  I like the wide angle of the camera but I wish it had a little bigger zoom.  Im still learning about the camera  how to optimize all the different options. The main reason for buying the camera was to have a durable, sturdy, all weather camera that I could use in a variety of conditions and activities so overall Im pleased.</Content>

We were snorkeling and the colors of the fish came out true. You need to watch were you place your fingers beause its easy to put over the lens. I would recommend this item!</Content>

<Content>This is my 3rd digital camera and the best one yet.  I love it!  I have had it for 3 months and already dropped it over 6 feet, left it out in the rain and hot sun, banged it around hiking and climbing, shot under water photos, taken spur of the moment action photos, day and night, cloudy and sunny, interior room photos, landscapes, close ups, macro, portrait, panorama, made movies, and made web page pictures, photos of art collection, as well as photographs to hang in an art show.   

It is so easy to use, compact, durable, rugged, waterproof and makes great pictures that can be blown up to poster size.  The macro settings are very good, and the wide angle is a plus.  The underwater settings are great for use day and night. The LCD is big and bright and easy to use without glasses, the buttons and menus are laid out and designed in a manner that is intuitive making it very user friendly.  

Most of my photography is of paranormal phenomena and at night.  My pictures are very detailed not too much noise or grain.  I have printed up large 13 x 19 photos that are exquisite in detail and color.   I havent even explored all of the features yet.  One is the built in LCD light, shadow adjustment, shoot and select, and there are many more hidden goodies.

When researching cameras, I thought that not having manual control was going to be a compromise.  Wanting a wide angle lens was a priority for me, big and bright LCD, another was ease of operation for spur of the moment photos.  Having many SLR cameras, carting around extra lenses, batteries, flash, and etc., and making sure to have the right setting was time consuming, cumbersome and burdensome, and felt like work.  Put it in your purse, pocket, bathing suit, so easy to carry, turn it on, dial in a scene mode and shoot!  It is so fun and in the moment!  Take as many pictures as you want.  You can make movies to your hearts content.  There is a lot of versatility and room for creativity with this point and shoot.  Having a camera always with me and ready to quickly capture those odd moments is such a delight and I have some amazing photos of lights, orbs, bugs and things that go bump in the night.

<Content>I am very happy with this camera. As an avid amateur photographer I hate being without a camera at all times. My Olympus Evolt 510 is great but too bulky to carry all the time. The 1030SW fills the bill as a snapshot camera. Water (and weatherproof) I never have to worry about it getting wet in the constant rain in SE Alaska were I live. Its small enough to slip in a pocket and takes very good pictures as well as good video. Shutter lag is minimal which has been a problem with other digital snapshot cameras. the body is small and very slippery, but the addition of a silicon skin makes it easy to hold. The photos are very sharp and the relatively large screen helps to frame shots well. I always shoot pictures at the highest resolution and the 2GB xD card holds well over 100 shots so I am not limited with the number of photos I can take. I look forward to obtaining a housing, and using this little gem while diving.

My 2 minor problems with the camera are the easy of including fingers over the lens in shots, especially when shooting quick action shots, and the lack of raw mode. I have become spoiled with my DSLR, shooting in raw mode and the ease of manipulating the files. I suppose one cant have everything for under $450.00.

<Content>I just got my camera today and have only used the 7.1 version.  From that experience I didnt want to repeat what everyone else has already said, I just wanted to share my story so far.

The back story:
I purchased the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS5.  It was a nice little point and shoot camera, but after carrying it around in my pocket one day, lint got behind the lens.  Having had a couple point and shoot cameras in my time, I didnt even realize this was possible, its never happened before.  Ive only had it a few months and short of completely disassembling the camera, theres nothing I can do about it.  The pictures are so bad now its not worth taking any.  Frustrating!

Flash forward to a couple weeks ago:
I took the kids to an indoor water park and didnt even bother bringing the lint damaged camera.  After a couple hours of fun, I noticed the park had digital waterproof cameras for rent so I tried it.  It was the Olympus 7.1 megapixel camera.  It was great, I could take it down the slides, take underwater shots of the kids in the pool and carry it around without having to worry about anything.  The shots were good, not outstanding, but good considering what I was putting it though.

So that got me to thinking, I didnt really need a waterproof camera, but if I had one, I wouldnt have to worry about LINT!

So as to not get burned again, I went out and did a little looking around.  There really wasnt much else out there.  So I got this 10 megapixel version in hopes of a slightly better picture, after all, 7.1 was good, 10 must be great! Right?  Anyway, when I went to order, this is when I got schooled on memory cards.  From what I found, Olympus and Fuji only use XD cards, which are slower and more expensive.  Not to mention, the biggest card I could find was 2 gigs.  Im sure that will be fine for the most part...and if not, I could get another... but I already had gigs of SD and MicroSD cards, so I wasnt real happy I couldnt use those.

So my camera shows up today, I open the box and right on top is an Olympus XD adapter for MicoSD cards!  Fantastic.  I didnt recall seeing anything about an adapter anywhere I read, so I just wanted to pass this along.</Content>

<Content>I bought this for my friend that is heading to China to pick up his to-be-adopted daughter, Lily.  My friend uses gadgets but is generally uncomfortable with electronics and the intricacies of tweaking options, downloading pictures, etc. He is also pretty rough on stuff.  I can see him dropping the camera, splashing it, etc.
So this camera seems a perfect fit for him.  So far he says the shutter delay is much less than his previous camera (an old model Canon point and shoot).  He says he has great comfort knowing this camera is indestructible.  I can see him using it more knowing that he isnt likely to ruin it by having it with him all the time.  He loves the video feature.
I didnt get a chance to see the image quality so I cannot comment.  I wish I could.
Ill add more to this review later if I get more specifics from him.</Content>

Check out the user photos for some pics I took from Grand Cayman.  90 percent of all my underwater shots (even when I couldnt see the screen because of glare or brightness of the sun) were very nice.

The scene selection menu is very helpful when you need a quick way to get just the right settings for a photo.

Out of the water, the pictures are fine if you arent trying to zoom very far.  Ill keep shooting all my out of water photos with my Sony DSC-H5.  The Stylus just cant hold a candle to 12x optical zoom and a Carl Zeiss lense.</Content>

<Content>My son came home from a school trip with my Canon Ixy 10 (bought in Japan, called Ixus 70 in Europe) dead after dropping it or carrying it in his pocket or whatever. So, I decided on getting a camera that could take rough handling. I had a Pentax Optio WP a few years ago, so I knew that underwater photography is a lot of fun.

This camera is a sturdy piece. It feels MUCH heavier than other cameras of its size, which I can live with, given that you can drop it and all. Its programs are user friendly, the software that comes with it is OK and it takes decent pictures outside, but... Dont even bother inside or in poor light conditions.

Sorry Olympus, but you dont come close to my old (lighter, cheaper but much frailer) Canon in any respect. The screen is not as clear and distinct as the Canon screen either. If all you need is a waterproof camera, go for Pentax.</Content>

<Content>I decided to purchase this particular camera for the shock + waterproof feature. I do a lot of backpacking/traveling. I wanted something that was small and durable, yet still  had good photo quality. I love the waterproof feature for around the beach or on the boat. Shockproof is good and I have tested it a couple of times accidentally. I am still learning to use all the features. My first trip using this camera was a couple week backpacking tour around the UK. Photos were good for the most part. The waterproof feature certainly came in handy as it poured rain most days. The menus are easy to navigate. My only real complaint is the positioning of the lens. You will find you get many shots with fingers in the corner. Overall I am pleased, It is exactly the rugged, small camera I was looking for. Price was excellent compared to other websites, and the shipping was fast. </Content>

<Content>I bought this camera primarily for its waterproof, dustproof, and almost indestructible make. Lets make it clear that I am no professional photographer, but I do see some problems with this camera which would easily make me replace it for something else. 

The 10 megapixels made it an ever better deal since you can enjoy your pictures up on a big screen, but here is the biggest problem with this stylus. The images dont look quite as nice as you would expect from a 10 megapixel camera. Some appear really grainy, others too dark or washed, and others have chromatic aberrations. I have minimized all of these by tweaking some of the setting in the camera, and have found that the auto setting is only good up to a certain point. Also, higher isos reveal very grainy and washed-out pictures - setting it at 200 and 400 have given me near perfect shots. Sometimes I dont feel comfortable switching it around according to the lighting, so I just go with the preset modes - and there are a whole lot of them which also give very good images.

While the picture quality was really upsetting at first, once I went snorkeling my doubts about the Stylus 1030 SW completely dispersed. This camera goes where no other can go, and the pictures and movies underwater made for some good time.

I definitely recommend it if youre looking for something fun, durable and with good picture quality. However, if youre looking for great picture quality then youre better off going with other models or even an expensive SLR.

* This stylus also has the Olympus Panorama function which takes picture in a phenomenal panoramic view. One of the other reasons why I bought it, and it was definitely worth it.</Content>

I have an old Canon S40 with a UW housing that takes excellent quality pictures - great optics for a point and shoot - but the old Canon is a bit heavy for my shirt pocket and very bulky with the UW housing.  Unfortunately, this Olympus 10mp camera takes poorer quality pictures than my old 4mp Canon S40, with or without the UW housing on.  Bright sunny day pics turn out acceptably on the Olympus, but any other lighting conditions result in dull, washed out looking, somewhat grainy pictures.  Sent it back.</Content>

<Content>Hands down, this camera is fantastic.

Ive taken it under water, through the worlds largest tomato fight in Spain, and all over the place. It can go through anything. 

It also has a picture mode for just about anything you can think of, and takes good pictures.

Im an outdoor enthusiast, and this camera is fantastic in almost every way. I love that I dont have to worry about where I take this camera, whether I get it dirty, or anything else - it just simply works. I love that.

Ok, now the bad stuff. Really this camera should get a rating of 4.8, because it lacks in a couple of areas.

1) You cant charge it from a USB source, so if youre going on a long trip, youre going to have to buy lots of extra batteries - bummer! And Im terribly annoyed that they did this.

2) It doesnt turn pictures right side up for you automatically. My friends $140 camera does this for her, and mine does not. It makes me cry every time she pulls out her cheapie.

But, those two deficiencies shouldnt be enough to draw you away from this camera. This thing is bullet proof, works in any environment, and Just works! period.

I think they added those two deficiencies just because it would be unfair to the other camera companies if they actually produced a completely perfect camera, no one would want any other one, we would loose competition, and ultimately monopolies are bad for the consumer anyway.

<Content>I have used this camera in the pool and in the water park for many times and it has worked great. No leaks or any other problems. Picture quality is average/mediocre compared to other digital cameras in the same price range at around $300+ (I also own a canon S2IS for non-water use, for it takes much better pictures even though it is a couple generations older). The wide-angle lens is great and I think this alone is well worth the $50 price difference between this and the 850SW. It takes some getting used to to hold the camera properly without touching the lens. The lens is kind of difficult to clean (especially when you get sunscreen grease on it). Video quality is ok but the microphone/voice quality is not good. Its hard to get good sound out of it because it is on the side of the camera where you hold it rather than on the front of the camera. The slideshow playback on the large LCD screen makes it a great toy for my toddler (I dont need to worry about the camera being dropped and abused). If you definitely need the waterproof feature, this camera will not disappoint. If thats optional and you primarily want great pictures, then there are a lot of other better cameras out there to choose from. BTW, replace the strap with a Wii strap so you wont have to worry about losing the camera in the water!</Content>

<Content>I bought an Olympus 1030 SW in May, and first used it 6/28/08, with 75 photos taken on it total. I last used it 8/28/08 when snorkeling in Lake Tahoe (fresh water, depth of 5 ft). On 9/5/08 when I tried to use it again, it started, beeped 4 times, then shut down. Charger says the battery is fully charged, and the View mode works (where the camera also indicates a fully-charged battery), but cannot otherwise take photos or videos. Was shocked to see that Olympus warrantee excludes damage caused by water, shock, or abuse to a supposedly waterproof, shockproof and crushproof camera. After the horror stories I see posted on the Internet regarding Olympus No Service and charging people to fix their defective/leaking cameras, Im considering contesting the credit card charge I bought it with.
Be warned! You may get lucky and get a Good Olympus 1030 SW, but their quality control appears to be letting some defective, non-waterproof units get into the retail stores. I would NOT trust this camera on a Once-in-a-lifetime trip ! </Content>

<Content>We took this camera to Puerto Vallarta last August.  It did really well with pictures taken on the outside.  The underwater pictures were great too.  The only problem I have with this camera is the fact that when in movie recording mode, you cant zoom.
This is the second Olympus camera Ive owned and love the ease of use.  But aside from this minor issue, I would say this is as good a product as my older Olympus.  </Content>

<Content>I researched the heck out of this camera before buying it....its purpose was for our Disney trip, specifically the water parks.  I tried it out at home in the pool and just love this camera.  People are amazed at the underwater videos Ive taken, and the pictures come out great too.  Not so good on maximum zoom in low light, but thats the only complaint.  I got a 8gb microsd and came home from florida with 300 hundred photos and a TON of video, with a ton of memory to spare.  This camera has given us video memories that NO OTHER little camera would do.  My only suggestion is to keep an eye on the lens if youre using it in the water.  Sometimes a droplet of water will stay on the lens and show up on subsequent pictures.  I just blow on it to get rid of any water.  No viewfinder is really no problem....I havent used one since my first digi camera 10 years ago!!!  I feel bad for those who have had trouble with this camera, because for me, its been amazing.</Content>

<Content>The Olympus Stylus 1030SW has been shipping with a known defect by Olympus.  In the video recording mode the sound track contains a popping sound.  It is generated by any touching of the camera.  Olympus is supposedly coming out with a firmware fix in September.  The buyer should beware of this problem and perhaps wait to purchase until a fix is incorporated in the cameras.</Content>

<Content>The Olympus Stylus 1030SW is the coolest camera Ive ever seen!!! I just got back from the beach with my family and it worked great. We had a ball with it in the ocean and now have some great memories to boot!!! The picture quality couldnt be better (as long as you use good photography techniques, you cant fight physics). I took video of myself and family riding waves in the ocean and it looks amazing. This camera is a great product that I am recommending to all my friends and family. Also, as a creative arts director for a non-profit I will be recommending its purchase by all of our new recruits.

-Make sure you buy a huge memory card though...I have the 2gig and it allows almost 2 hrs of video.

-The floating wrist strap is a must if you intend to use the camera anywhere near moving water.


Great Job Olympus!!!!</Content>

<Content>I really wanted to love this camera.  It has everything I wanted: rugged, compact, waterproof, and takes great pictures.  I currently have a Panasonic Lumix TZ-5, and a the Panasonic waterproof casing for it, and never used this combo with the Olympus Stylus 1030 SW around!

It was so easy to carry the Stylus 1030 SW around on the pool/beach and into the water.  It starts up almost immediately upon pressing the power button so I never missed a shot.  I loved that it was shock-proof so I didnt have to mentally treat it with kid gloves, and there are no protrusions on the camera to worry about breaking.

Now the bad news.  After the first time going into the pool for about 3 feet underwater, the camera seems to be adversely affected.  I was extra careful and followed the directions regarding checking the seals for foreign objects that may cause leaks, and they were properly closed.

I noticed that the videos taken (maybe from this point on, maybe always had this problem) had a smudge about the middle of the screen.  This was not dirt on the outside of the lens where I can get at and clean.  It would disappear under certain lighting conditions, but most underwater shots had it.  My guess is that its an internal reflective defect or dirt on the optics.  Curiously, I dont notice it in my photos, just videos.

In addition to this, the lens would fog up during the night after some underwater excursions.  The fog would cloud up the lens internally, so all photos and videos were foggy.  Holding the camera in my hands would warm it up, causing the fog to get cloudier.  As a work-around, I would air dry the camera each night with all its ports open, but this doesnt always work.

Another major drawback of this camera that was not publicized very well is that you MUST use the type M+ XD memory card to record VGA in 30 frames/sec.  Using the included adapter my 4GB MicroSDHC card, you are limited to 10 seconds VGA 30 frames/sec videos.  You can record lower resolution or VGA with 15 frames/sec videos without the M+ XD memory card, though.

Additionally, my videos would sometimes have strange regular very loud clicking sounds, about once click per second for certain stretches.  This was very disconcerting.

I also noticed that the videos of bright lights indoors would sometimes have vertical glares above and below the light sources.  I never noticed this phenomenon on my TZ-5 videos.

The final weird restriction that I found out only after using this camera was that it had two video modes: Underwater, and Non-underwater.  In Underwater mode, you have no audio, but can use zoom.  In Non-underwater mode, you can record audio, but cannot zoom.  Perhaps the zooming caused horrible audio noises to be recorded so the engineers decided to never record audio while allowing zooming?

In conclusion, the Olympus Stylus 1030 SW was everything I was looking for on paper and would have been a wonderful all purpose point-and-shoot photo and video camera for all occasions.  Unfortunately, my particular unit seemed not be quite waterproof as advertised, and the model had some major design drawbacks in the areas of video recording.

I really cannot recommend this camera based on the unit I had.

Update 9/6/08

The return process at Amazon.com was extremely smooth and painless.  I definitely recommend Amazon.com based on their customer service.

Update 9/12/08

Upon looking at my pictures taken with this camera, I noticed that they did not have the proper orientation flag set.  On my other digital cameras, my landscape and portrait shots have proper orientation flags so that programs like Picasa can auto-rotate.  Not so with this camera.  Seems like a strange omission from Olympus.</Content>

<Content>***Edit #2 - After using the camera a lot more, including in my pool, ive upgraded my rating to a 4 star.  The underwater capabilities of this camera are great.  Great photo quality (clearer the water, the better).  Survivability of camera is also great.  So far, 2 trips to the pool, approximately 30 min of consistent time under the water, including me jumping into the pool with the camera running - no significant issues so far.  Quality of pics are great.  Clear water provides great range.  You can see the other end of the pool from the opposite end clearly.  You will occasionally get bubbles that form on the lens and therefore, your image will contain this bubble, but, crap happens.  the bubbles did not stay on the camera and thats whats important.  I took a video of myslef jumping into the pool - no degradation in image quality nor issues with camera functionality.  Worked great.  No sound though for underwater movie mode - but it makes sense since otherwise, all youd hear is water swooshing.  Youre not buying this camera to listen to whales after all.  
***


Ive had this camera for a little over two weeks.  Bought it so that i can take underwater images when in Hawaii.  Havent tried out the waterproof aspect yet, but can go ahead and give some insight into the quality of its normal pics.

10 mp camera, but is limited to 3 mp images when shooting on some of the preset modes (scenes) - specifically candlelight images and other night-time image settings.  If you dont use the scene options, your images can be maxed at the 10 mp setting.  Night images using scene (candlelight) were pretty grainy, so id avoid using that setting.  

Normal daytime images were good.  Crisp and clear.  From power to first image - is really quick.  However, taking one image at 10 mp causes a delay before you can take the next image of ~2 seconds.  Unless you use the burst mode.  3-shot burst allows for 10 mp images, whereas the super 12 shot mode caps it again at 3 mp images.  

People have written that the lcd screen is easy to see in any light from any angle.  I discovered that this is not true.  Taking an image into the sun (i know this isnt recommended) while holding the camera up high (which people will use when at weddings to shoot over peoples heads) leads to glare.  I had to guess what i was shooting at.  Id say image visibility on the lcd was ~50% when doing this.  

Even given the above, i still like the camera a lot.  Looks nice.  Takes panoramic photos, battery lasts forever.  Used it on and off for 4 days before it finally warned me of being low.  Be careful b/c the battery indicator is deceiving.  It said full for most of the time and then jumped to warning quick on me.  Didnt even notice any intermediate indication position. 

I give it a 3 for now until i go and try out the underwater capability.

Edit #1: Forgot to mention that the menus are pretty easy to use.  Scrolling wheel menu cycles between the different options.  One touch photo preview.  Icons are easy to understand.  

Ive tried using the macro and super macro - works really well.  Good detail on the close images.  

One other con though - could not for the life of me figure out how to get the face detection to work.  I swear that itll sometimes follow a face and sometimes itll target a random cup. I dont yet see an option in any of the menus that allows me to force it to do face rec every shot.  Not a huge issue - but its a spec that is being advertised, therefore i expect it to work.  </Content>

Now her friends and cousins are going to sell their cameras and buy this one.  I highly recommend this.

<Content>I love my new camera.  I am not, by any means, a professional but it does everything I wanted it to do.  I carry it with me all the time because it is so small and lightweight.  I took it kayaking and got some great photos and did not have to worry about it getting wet.  I also took it to an amusement park and on all the water rides.  I live in a wooded area with a lot of wildlife.  I have been able to get some awesome photos of the deer through windows from inside the house so as not to scare them.  Yes it does have one issue, you have to be careful not to put fingers in front of the shutter, but thats easy to learn.  I am very happy with my purchase.</Content>

<Content>Bought this product before our trip to Jamaica, mon.  Tried it out in the pool before leaving and it worked great.  Took it on our trip and got great pictures, with one caveat.  Make sure youre using the right setting.  If the colors dont look right on the screen, youre probably taking above water pictures using the underwater setting.

In clear water, underwater pictures are outstanding.  In murky water, your underwater pictures are murky.

<Content>When I first heard that Olympus was making a waterproof digital camera line, I instantly wanted one. I have been an Olymus owner for countless years through several different models. Im always taking pictures and end up buying waterproof disposable cameras far too often! Months passed and I sort of forgot about it until a friend showed me her 1030 she recently purchased. 

In all of my research (a ritual for me before buying anything over 100 dollars) I read several reviews that gave the camera great ratings and some that mentioned poor picture quality, difficulty finding settings for taking different types of photos, and faulty waterproof features. I was a little disheartened. Still I figured if my friend had one and loved it than maybe I should give it a try.

Ive had my 1030 for a little over a month and LOVE this camera! If you have used Olympus digitals before the menu and settings are pretty standard with a few new features. I find them very simple and easy to use. It even does well when just left on the auto setting.

As far as picture quality goes, it can be awesome at times and sometimes a little faulted. Mostly the pictures that dont come out great are that way due to my improper use of the camera functions ( I need to take a little time to play with more of the settings), or in water situations a droplet getting on the lens (which is to be expected at times and doesnt really bother me). Being able to have a camera in water is worth a few botched shots, especially when its digital and you can see that theres a problem and fix it right away. The way I figure it, if I wanted the most fantastic and perfect pictures ever I wouldnt be looking for a durable waterproof camera. It is what it says its going to be, end of story.

In reading the manual, I came to find out that this camera cannot be guaranteed waterproof after being immersed in water for over an hour. The people who gave the reviews saying that it was in fact not waterproof all had theirs in water for much longer. One person had it in for over three hours! I find it awesome that it lasted that long! Ive been dipping, dunking, splashing, and dropping mine all over the place and it is still as good as new.

In short, if you are looking for a durable waterproof camera that can take quality photos of your expeditions, vacations, fun times, and memorable moments, this is the one for you!

<Content>While Ive been happy with this camera for the past 45 days, now that Im in Hawaii and on vacation, it stopped working almost immediately.  There are numerous positive reviews of this camera but it appears there are growing issues with an apparent design flaw - I count three reviews already from unhappy owners of this camera.  Unfortunately, weve already bulked up on xD cards and other accessories but are now considering spending a likely small fortune to have our unit repaired, after vacation, and buying another underwater camera, most likely a Sony or Canon with an underwater housing, to be shipped to us overnight.  Overall, a very expensive experiment with Olympus...and their Service Department was very unhelpful in this situation - send it to us and well fix it in 5-7 business days.  I would suggest you carefully look at your options BEFORE buying this particular camera.</Content>

<Content>The fist time I took it in salt water was nerve wracking, but it worked as advertised.  The underwater pictures are tricky to get, and you do need to use the underwater setting or the shots come out blurry.  It takes great pictures for a camera that you can treat like a B** stepchild.  

Because of the fact that its so rugged and takes good pictures, I will probably get another one in the future.  If you want to take stunning pictures though, you need to purchase a quality DSLR.

Quick note: Buy an extra battery!  You can find generic replacement batteries online for about $12 bucks a piece at the time of this writing, and I strongly recommend you get at least one.

Also, you dont need to purchase the expensive XD card, it comes with an adaptor that accepts the common and CHEAP MicroSD card.</Content>

The version 1.1 camera firmware update, already installed on my camera when it arrived (no need to have it downloaded with the Olympus Master 2 software - although there is an update available for that as well), allows support of memory cards greater than 2GB. The camera comes with an adapter to convert microSDHC cards (8 GB for example) to the XD format needed for the camera.

Another couple on our snorkel trip had the same camera they had also bought for their trip  it too leaked. They were able to recover their photos after drying it out but the screen had water in it  the photos all had a blurry area in the same location on all the photos from water.

It would be a great camera if it worked but I would NOT trust it with your vacation photos. Olympus clearly needs to work out some bugs before this is ready for purchase!</Content>

I bought a microSD instead of the Olympus XD and it worked fine. The only advice I can tell you is make sure you swap modes once you get back out of the water or else your pictures will look weird. Also, watch your thumb when you take pics.</Content>

<Content>This is a great product. Really clear photos underwater, quick-ready so you can grab it and snap a photo in seconds. Feature-packed. I really like the create calendar feature. The only changes I would make to the design? Add a viewfinder for use with action scenes and video; also it might be better to have the lens in the center of the camera instead of where fingers naturally get in the way. 

Battery life is very long, microphone is accurate for audio reproduction and this thing will take a beating. I used it for a month in Costa Rica in all sorts of weather, in hot springs and on the beach/salt water. Zero problems. A really great camera! Just what I expected from Olympus.</Content>

I used my new Olympus 1030 SW on a trip to Grand Cayman, after the first use in water it kept reading a message that there was a compartment open, which I could not see. The next day I was able to use it and I took hundreds of pics. Some were awesome and others grainy, but then again it stopped working saying there was a compartment open. I returned it; got a new one. Took some really great pics out of water, then the first time in the water after taking a few pics it just turned off and turning it on did not do a thing. I am returning it luckily within 30 days. But I am extremely disappointed in this product.

<Content>Looking for a durable camera for your thru-hike?  Youve found it.  You cant find another camera with comparable features, this has everything you need to make it from Mexico to Canada and then some.  Make the right choice and get the one that will make it all the way with some really adverse conditions to go through and keep on working.  You dont want to miss any shots or worry about that last river crossing so get the camera that will get the job done and very well at that.</Content>

<Content>Important to know info: BUY memory cards.  It doesnt come with them and you can only take about 5 or 6 pics without it.  I didnt know this so I had to go to Best Buy to play with my new toy the day it arrived.  oops.  Get the M+ cards (rather than M) to enjoy all the features and faster speed!
.
I purchased this camera because of the water proof and shockproof features. From the web research, I expected it to be bigger, so the compact size is a pleasant bonus! Thus far it is performing as advertised.  I have 3 children, ages 13, 3, 2.  I have let all of them play with this camera in the house and in the pool.  It takes great pictures under water and it is perfectly OK after being dropped by a toddler! My husband cringed when I gave my new camera to our 3 year old, but I said Its shockproof up to 6 feet and shes only 3 feet tall.  The most she will drop it is probably 2 feet.  He cringed even more when she did finally drop it on a tile floor.  I checked it out.  Everything is fine!  We are taking this new camera/memory saver on every future family vacation, starting with a trip to the Grandparents in TN next week.  Cant wait to see those lake pictures ... both above and below water!!
.
Of course every camera could have improvements, so I will include my wish list, but this in no way should take away from what a great little camera this is. There are 2 things I would like to see:
1. I would like more/better zoom.  
2. I would like a faster recovery time between pictures, so I can take a bunch quickly and then later delete whichever ones arent good.  I dont like that it thinks for a second or two about each picture, displays it for me, and then gets ready for the next shot.  For this issue, I can either shoot video and make pix, or there is a quick shoot feature where you get to shoot a few and then delete.  Maybe I havent figured that one out yet, it seems weird to me.
.
Like I said, dont let my extra wish list deter you from getting this camera.  Its my attempt at fair and balanced reporting.  This is a fantastic little camera and I highly recommend it.  I have had lots of fun with it.</Content>

<Content>This camera is a great beach camera.  It is waterproof to 33 Ft and can withstand bumping and banging.  It was fun to take it in the water and shoot pictures snorkeling, boating, swimming, etc.  The picture quality is very good, but we did have some issues with the video.  When zooming in while taking a video, the video quality became very blurry.  Also, the way the camera is designed your fingers get in the way of the speaker and you end up with a bumping noise on your videos.  The only other complaint is that while the camera itself is durable, the finish on the camera scratches easily.  After only a few days of use, it looked very beat up.  While this doesnt affect how it works, it looks bad cosmetically.</Content>

The battery lasts fairly well, and the charger is small and compact.  It has many options of different modes, including a few different choices for underwater modes -which is great. It was a convenient size to make it easy to take anywhere.  I also use Nikon D300 and this is great for when you just want to take snapshots and dont want to take along a big camera.</Content>

<Content>I researched this camera heavily before purchasing it. I was even a bit skeptical with its claims of being waterproof, shockproof, etc. But in the end, I decided to give it a shot and I have not been disappointed.

This camera lives up to its promise. I tested it underwater and it took very nice pictures! Although, one thing you do need to keep in mind is that for the camera to stay functional, you need to follow the very simple upkeep instructions.

Image quality: Absolutely amazing. I bought a 2gb xd for the camera and on 10mp normal resolution you can take about 400 photos. I set my photos at 10mp fine resolution. I really like this feature because on my older camera, I had to convert the image to high-res after it was on the computer.

One thing with the image quality that you might need to watch out for: if you are shooting macro or super-macro, youll probably want to use a tripod. You can get a decent shot without one, but a tripod makes it soo much easier.

Another great thing about this camera is the battery. I wasnt sure I was going to like having a battery you had to plug into the wall to charge but its great to not have to keep buying AAs all the time. The battery keeps a charge quite a few hours of fairly heavy use (constant zooming, turning off/on, viewing images, etc.) You can find replacement batteries for fairly cheap too. I found an offbrand battery for $[...] and free shipping on [...].

Also, in researching this camera, I found some links to the possibilities of photography with this camera.

Photos taken with Olympus 1030sw: [...]

Videos taken with Olympus 1030sw:[...]



UPDATE: Out of curiousity Ive been checking up to see how people have liked this camera, to see how other people have been liking it.

I noticed some people have complained about bad picture quality in close up and that is most likely the users fault because of not using macro mode AND a tripod (which I said before).

And with the waterproof thing, you want to open the compartments up after youve used it to dab up any water that was sitting on the waterproof seals (Make sure youre away from water at that point... and that youre hands are dry). When I opened the camera up the last time I used it underwater, I noticed some water laying on the top of the battery, which Im sure was due to the fact the I opened it upside-down. Im assuming that the water that was being stopped by the seals has shifted from me opening the compartment. At that point, I just carefully dabbed the wetness with a dry paper towel and it was fine. Camera works perfect still. No problems with it that I have seen. Still a 5/5.

This camera is very user friendly, you just have to make sure keep it well. Follow the instructions and youll love it. Enough said.</Content>

<Content>I just got this camera for my birthday and i been looking at the reviews on amazon saying that this camera takes bad pictures. HELL NO IT DOESNT! It is probably the easiest camera to use. I think the problem with people getting bad shots is that they dont know how to use a camera in general. I mean the settings are right there for you to use. Honestly if you cant choose the pre settings that are available then just switch it to auto. lol 

I dont know what other people are talking about with the battery. If someone is saying something negative about it then they just got a bad one. Hey, it happens. When I got my camera, I put the battery in right away and used it for 15 min. After 15 min it said it was gonna die. I recharged it for 3 hours. The next day I took it to the water park for 6 hours. And during the six hours it was probably turned on for 5 because i hardly turned it off. I was taking so many pictures! Also if you need to know, the camera was in the water pretty much the entire time possible. Gave me no problems. So after 5 hours of it being on, I checked the battery life on the screen. GUESS WHAT!?!?! Still FULLY CHARGED!!! 

Taking video.. On VGA mode yes only ten seconds. But on QVGA at 30fps IT LOOKED GREAT!! and it records as long as you have space on your memory card. Sound could be a little better but its a camera for a reason. to take pictures.

Great camera. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to get their moneys worth.</Content>

<Content>Great camera if you want/need a waterproof/shockproof camera.
The image quality for pictures taken outdoors is great. But it is really not good for indoor pictures with high ISOs, the pictures becomes extremely pixelated and grainy. I wish they had used a better processor for higher ISO pictures. But if waterproof is the ultimate goal this is definitely the way to go. I took some great pictures underwater and outdoors in general.  Nice size and robust built. High recommend for its purpose but if artistic/great shots is your goal, go for a DSLR. This is a bit pricey too, and I got it because I broke my last two cameras because of water spills.</Content>

<Content>I took this camera on a few kayak trips.  It performed great, is easy to use, and had excellent battery life.  One problem was that the camera insisted the battery cover was open, although it wasnt.  It took a hair dryer for a few seconds to the open battery compartment to straighten things out.  The only reason Im giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the lcd and the face of the camera were scratched for no apparent reason other than the normal exposure to gear and elements of a kayaking trip.  A camera that is supposed to be tough shouldnt scratch so easily.  I would suggest getting the silver as the scratches may be less noticeable if you plan to take it along on a similar trip.</Content>

I also used it in the rain at a baseball game, something I would have been hesitant to do with a standard point-and-shoot.

<Content>Ive been using a Sony camera for a few years and was fairly happy with it.  My first digicam was an Olympus and I loved it, Im still not sure why I bought a Sony after that???  Well, Im happy to say that Im back with Olympus again in this fine camera!
Compared to the Soney Cybershot T-9, the Olympus is just slightly bigger and heavier, but not much of either.  I really like the way it is put together, feels solid and well made.  Ive only used it for about a week now so I cant report thoroughly on it but here are my first impressions...
The Good: Solid, well made feel.  Large LCD screen is very clear and easy to see in daylight.  Waterproof feature is great!  The macro functions are very nice, there is an LED light that can be turned on to highlight the subject.  It works well in Macro mode but not good for much more.  Im not a pro but I think it takes awesome pictures.  The underwater shots I took on the first day (in the pool) were fantastic.  Everybody that sees them thinks they are great too!  I also took some underwater video and it came out great.  The underwater settings seem to work well but I havent tried any other settings underwater yet.  One thing I want to try is video with sound underwater just to see what it picks up.  I am not using the software that came with the camera so I cant comment on that, but I will say that it comes with Olympus software that is pretty extensive.  I remember the version on my old Olympus was pretty good but now I just use whats included with Windows Vista, which is fine for me right now.
The Not So Good: The controls are a bit small so it is sometimes difficult to get my chubby fingers on the right buttons.  Just a minor annoyance though.  The wrist strap that comes with the camera is nice but for a camera whose main feature is Waterproof, they should have included a beefier strap that could cinch up around your wrist.  If I were a to take this camera in deeper water I would want a better strap to ensure it wouldnt come off and sink to the bottom.
Thats all I have for now.  Ive had no problems at all so far and the waterproof features are working well.  Just remember to flush the camera with fresh water after you take it in the pool or ocean and make sure all the seals are intact before you dunk it in any water!</Content>

<Content>This is a GREAT camera.  Takes nice, clear, well detailed pictures that show well on a computer and make lovely prints.  Functions are easy to understand and use.  Have taken it to the pool and it is waterproof as claimed and the underwater pictures it took were just fabulous.  Only complaint is that the power button and the shoot button are awfully close together which makes it easy to accidently turn the camera off instead of shoot a picture.  Also, the lens is in kind of an aquward place if you have larger hands, so you have to watch where you are holding the camera or your fingers will find their way into the picture.  Wouldnt hesitate to buy it again!</Content>

I have only taken it about a foot underwater so far, but has taken decent pictures in murky water. I am active outdoors, I scuba dive, snorkel, raft, snowboard etc. and I think this camera is ideal for me. It is a point and shoot and has limited capabilities, but I was not looking for a SLR camera. </Content>

<Content>While owning a dSLR for a long time Ive been interested in getting a compact camera but never did it. Once my son started swimming I thought how cool it would be to get a compact camera that can take pictures while in the pool... Finding very limited selection I was concerned over the quality of the camera but after receiving it all of my doubts have left me!

The camera is not as lightweight as it might seem from the images. It is compact and can be carried in a pocket but it is durable. I have not tested the shockproof aspect of the camera but from its construction I assume it lives up to the hype.

As for the pictures there are positives and negatives. Any outdoor picture taken has been great - including the underwater photos. The color is good and rich, action shots (taken in the right mode) turn out great and of course the big reason to get this camera, the underwater photos are stunning. Swimming is an all new experience with this camera and its a lot of fun to get this special pictures that you cant get with most cameras! The negative side are indoor pictures. While the pictures are still good and usable for prints there is visible noise in the pictures in many of those pictures - even when using the flash. The camera is usable indoors but it is at its best outdoors.

I havent taken many videos yet. Having a hi-def camcorder I didnt buy this camera for its video feature... Of course, you can take video underwater with this camera which is also fairly unique I just havent done it yet. Note that in order to get the maximum resolution and FPS for the camera you need to specificly get the Olympus M+ media card. Non-Olympus or non-M+ Olympus cards will restrict the video to 10 seconds at maximum resolution/fps...

Everyone that I have shown the camera to, the pictures and then told them the price were amazed at it and have talked about ordering one as well. A great buy to get some very special pictures!

<Content>We purchased this for a trip to the Bahamas.  It worked fine for about 2 days of mostly land shots.  We did try a few underwater shots and got what we expected from a PS camera.  I liked the Scene selection menu for camera settings, it was helpful and improved my ability to take decent shots in a variety of conditions without thinking about settings too much.  Solid package, nice controls, would buy again...if I trusted it.  We had to buy disposable cameras for the remainder of our trip because in 15 minutes in a 4ft 5in pool (taking photos just below the surface for fun and mostly just using it like I would a water resistant camera, it leaked water into the lens housing.  This wasnt enough to fry the electronics...just enough to make the picture all white when taking pictures (foggy is a good descriptor).  It also affected the controls because it would zoom in fully automatically each time I turned it on.

I was VERY conscientious of checking the seals for debris or defect and ensureing the memory card and battery were fully seated (because I had read reviews saying people had leaks and others saying they werent careful enough).  It still leaked and it did it around the lens housing (theres no user operated seal there, its just built in).

The search for a replacement ensues.</Content>

<Content>I recently bought this camera mainly because I was sick and tired of accidentally breaking more fragile point and shoots. As many reviews state, this camera is a tank but (IMHO) very well designed and visually appealing. The photos are good but not great for a camera in this price range. However, the way I look at it, you are paying for the durability and underwater capabilities over picture quality.

The shooting options and settings are varied and flexible and the scene and guide modes are a great addition for newbies who either dont know how or dont wish to bother with manually changing the ISO, white balance etc. Also, this camera produces nice video both in and out of the water as well.

Overall I am pleased with my purchase EXCEPT for the following facts which I feel that I need to point out and which really disappoint me about Olympus: 

1) When taking video in VGA mode at 30fps you are limited to only 10 seconds of recording time!! Well, that is unless you purchase one of Olympuss new xD Type M+ cards. In that case you can record up to the limit of the card but there is still a catch; the new xD Type M+ cards only go up to 2gb. This limits you to only 18 minutes of record time. Plus, even though this camera accepts 8gb microSDHC cards (with the included adapter), Olympus has decided that you can only record at that setting for longer than 10 seconds on their own, proprietary card. Also, even when shooting at lesser settings, Olympus caps your videos at 29 minutes REGARDLESS of the storage capacity of the medium. On top of all this is the fact that the documentation on the camera, though technically accurate, is very misleading on this point. Nowhere in the documentation does Olympus ever state 29 minutes is the maximum recording time. If you look at page 54 of the manual, it shows a 1GB card maxing out at 29 minutes, but doesnt show the limits of a 2GB or higher card...this leaves the average consumer to think that larger cards could record longer of course.

2) Another feature that is disabled unless you are using one of Olympuss proprietary cards is the panoramic function. This is disabled when using a micro SD card for storage. Why would Olympus do this? IMO both of the above situations are just Olympuss way of pressuring the consumer to buy their memory cards. Overall this wouldnt be that big of issue (well, besides the whole shadyness of the tactic) but Olympuss cards are too small and too slow when compared with the newer generation of microSDHC cards that currently can hold up to 8gb and move data at up to 6mb per second. Plus, why not allow standard SDHC cards which can hold up to 32gb and can be MUCH faster? Heck, I wouldnt necessarily mind buying and using an xD card but Olympus really needs to up their storage capacity and speed in order to compete with SDHC and MicroSDHC instead of attempting to hold the consumer hostage by means of petty, unnecessary function limits.

<Content>I read the reviews about poor, grainy picture quality-they all sounded like they came from more experienced photographers so I figured an amateur like myself would never notice.  WRONG!  We bought this camera because our old Sony wasnt taking pictures like it used to after being abused by our two young boys for 5 years-even after all that, our old Sony takes better pics at the lowest resolution (under 1 megapixel)in bad lighting than the Olympus at the highest megapixel (10.1) in good lighting.  We tried everything and couldnt get a picture that wasnt grainy, at best.  Also, DONT EVEN TRY to take pics at a sporting event-the shutter speed and reset is so slow that I took a picture of my 5 year old son getting handed the football at the 20 yard line and it didnt reset until after he was done celebrating in the end zone.  At his Kindergarden graduation he had to walk 100 feet to the podium...I could only take one shot it was SO SLOW.  Definitely a DO NOT BUY...a terrible shame considering how cool the Shockproof, Waterproof features are.</Content>

<Content>Canon, Sony or Nikon do not offer a waterproof digital camera.  So it was a no brainer that if I were to finally hang up my trusty old Nikonos waterproof underwater camera and get a replacement it would have to be an Olympus.  I have used my Nikonos as an all purpose outdoor camera mostly for my fishing trips taking pictures of my quarry in the rivers or the salt water flats.  I rarely went diving and dont really need an underwater camera, like the Nikonos, that is waterproof up to 300 feet.  Waterproof cases are bulky and expensive and therefore it was not an option for me to consider.  I recently took my new Olympus 1030SW to my Bonefishing trip in the Bahamas and was pleasantly surprised at how advanced and user friendly the features are.  There are three features that are new to me that I find innovative.  Panorama - combining three shots into one in camera.  Guide - shoot with effects preview, allows you to compare previews of different effects such as variations of exposure, zoom, color temperature, thirdly super macro - allows you to shoot super close ups.

There isnt really anything I dislike about the camera.  The compact size is great, the battery last more than a day of constant shooting (without flash),  writing to the memory card is abit slow and can get in the way if you need to take multiple shots quickly,   Using the faster M Plus card, which I should have bought,  may speed things up.  

I highly recommend this camera to all anglers and others sportsmen near water,  you can hang it around your neck or put it in your pocket and not worry about it until you need to take a picture. Having a camera with you at all times, instead of putting it back into a waterproof bag,  ensures that you dont miss out on any photo opportunities</Content>

<Content>I am aware that the reviews rate this camera inferior to others.  However, if you want a camera that you can use anywhere, this is the camera for you.  it take great underwater movies and I am quite satisfied with the Quality of almost all the shots I took.  I took pictures in the water of a tow banana boat that I could not let go of more than one hand and they turned out great. Of course I didnt know that until after the ride. </Content>

<Content>After dropping/breaking my previous Olympus camera, I new it was time for a not so fragile digital.  We also live on the lake and were always worried about dropping the camera in the water and getting our hands dry before using it.  I dont know how many good shots I missed due to being wet.  Problem solved.  This camera is rugged and can withstand the weather.  If you have been researching this camera, you know it is waterproof to 33 (with underwater snap shot and video modes), freezeproof to -14 degrees, crush proof up to 220 lbs, and shock proof to 6.  There is no other digital camera that can withstand this type of abuse.  

I am extremely happy with this camera.  Others have suggested the scene modes (on the menu) to be an extra step, but I like the way it outlines each mode, so you can have the right mode for the situation.  The camera does great in auto mode and Ive found the scene modes to be very helpful.  The under water pictures are very clear and the scene options work well.  My biggest surprise was the clarity on the fireworks mode.  It really does great!

The only downside is the zoom.  Im used to 10x optical on my last Olympus while this one has 3.6x.  However, the other features far outweigh the lack of zoom.  You cant expect high optical zoom in a camera the size of a deck of cards.  

If you buy this camera, you must get the M+ or H card.  These high speed memory cards allow you to shoot video at 30fps for the entire length of your memory.  Standard XD cards and M cards only allow for 10 second clips.  My 2GB M+ allows for 18 minutes of consecutive video at 30fps.  The XD M+ and H cards are also 1.5 times faster, so the next shot delay is shorter.

I would recommend this camera to anyone who is active.  Standard digitals are just too fragile.  Throw it in the boat, canoe, or ski pack and do your thing without a worry of breaking your camera. </Content>

<Content>this camera is great. its a wonderful overall do anything camera.  I have a sony cybershot and also a cannon digital camera and features wise, this one rocks.  it has so many pluses, let me just go over the parts i didnt like.

1.wrist strap.  i wish they would of gave us a locking wrist strap. i mean come on! this is supposed to go anywhere.
2.water bubbles. i was taking some videos in the water ( a river) and noticed when i switched to picture mode that there was huge watter bubble right in the middle of the lens!!!
3.no video zooming.  no video zooming, this sucks, i want to be able to zoom when i take video, is that soo hard!!!
4.panorama mode blurs. I love panorama mode, but half the time it will mess up.  it just takes soo long, and when it does mess up, i just delete the picture and I dont feel like retaking it... maybe the free space isnt a bad thing.
5. xd card. i hate xd cards, and now i want to get the high speed card just to take 30fps video... oh well, i guess i will live with the lower speed.

well, those are the only negatives i can think of.  if this camera survives the ocoee river (rafting trip) i will post back another review. all in all, it is a great purchase, especially if you often do watersports.</Content>

<Content>I did a lot of research looking for a replacement for my aging Pentax 43WR. I wanted rugged, waterproof, compact  capable of unlimited 640x480x30fps video with sound as we go rafting, to the water park, etc and movie clips of good times are a must with us. The earlier Olympus SW series didnt meet all my requirements but the new 1030SW looked very promising, especially with the firmware update that allows for unlimited video when using the Olympus M+ xD memory card. Now that Ive had it for awhile, here are my thoughts:
Pros: Small, rugged, waterproof, easy to use for most simple pointshoot shots, good pics (not as good as my DSLR shots but then it goes where the DSLR cant)  good videos w/sound.
Cons: Uses proprietary battery  memory card if you want unlimited video (annoying but minor), no optical viewfinder for those rare times the LCD display washes out, battery drains quickly when transferring pics to computer (I suggest the optional DC power supply  adapter, adapter should be part of the basic camera kit but isnt).
Bottom line: If your emphasis is on rugged/waterproof  small enough to take anywhere then seriously consider this camera. Pics arent DSLR quality but then its not made to compete w/DSLRs and the handiness, ruggedness  video capabilities more than make up for pic quality for my needs. If it had an optical viewfinder Id give it 5 stars in spite of the proprietary battery, adapter  memory card.

<Content>Purchased this camera and within a month of snorkeling on weekends (live in Hawaii) the camera was full of water without going deeper than maybe 5ft.  The product was purchased directly through amazon.com versus through one of the other vendors available through amazon.com so the return policy was easy  uncomplicated - they even paid for the return shipping costs  made a full refund.  My next camera purchase is the same model through amazon.com as well (return process was so easy always check vendor if possible) as the picture clarity is great, camera is so simple and easy to use, and is compact enough you can swim without it being too bulky or heavy.  New order should arrive this week - check to see in a month if the last one was just a fluk defect or if this camera is flawed as a quasi-underwater camera for novice photographers.  I look forward to purchasing the underwater housing...then it can come along on scuba days too!</Content>

<Content>I recently purchased this camera.  After looking at many -- I previously owned a HP 797 -- top of the line 4 years ago and loved it.  My new camera is great.  I purchased it because I can take it under water up to 30 and take pictures when I snorkel.  The only thing I miss is the view finder -- I have to take pictures using the screen on the back of the camera.  Just a retraining of where to look.  It is easy to use -- again just retraining myself to use different buttons.  I like to 10.1 mp for a point and shoot camera.  The price thru Amazon.com was good too.</Content>

<Content>I just returned from a kayaking and white water rafting trip in Colorado.  I bought this camera when my last digital stopped working after a trip to the beach.  I wanted to make sure that didnt happen again and I liked the fact that the 1030SW is waterproof/dustproof/freezeproof/shockproof.  As advertised it was exactly suited to my trip.  Im happy to report that the camera worked out fine.  Even after being knocked about and complteely submerged it still took wonderful pictures and is none the worse for wear.  The pictures are not as crisp as I thought a 10 MP camera would be and there are undoubtedly better cameras available.  But if you have an active lifestyle that includes snorkling, rafting, or other chalenging environments, then this is a perfect choice.  Better a very good picture with this camera than no pictures and maybe no camera with something less durable.</Content>

<Content>You can take it anywhere (beach, snow, underwater) and do not have to worry about it getting damaged.
I have tried it 28 feet under water, went rafting, kayaking, canopy, and recorded videos while diving into the water and it still works.
Good quality pics, up to 10 MP, lots of digital functions for you to play with in different environments.
Flash is not that strong, but is does the work.
You have to clean your camera every day after any extreme sport because dirt tends to get inside the water seals and in may lose its waterproof features. Its an easy clean up though.

<Content>This is my third Olympus camera and I love the flexibility of not worrying about water. I broke one camera when I accidentally sat on in with the lens open. Since this one is completely contained, there is no risk.

If you want a camera that you can take to the beach, on a kayak trip, skiing, etc. This is the one for you. I will be trying it on a scuba trip later this summer.

The photos I am getting are really clear. I had a 7 Mega pixel camera before, but I can crop farther with this one.

The digital zoom seems to work OK, but it limits the resolution of the photos.

I have been using this camera for a month now and still have not had to recharge the battery, so I guess battery life is going to be good. </Content>

<Content>Bought this product about one week before a ten day vacation in the British Virgin Islands.  Tested the camera beforehand.  Have shot exclusively in Digital SLR for last four years.  Wanted a waterproof camera for snorkeling and the beach.  The 10 megapixels was a plus.  Minimal shutter-lag was also a plus.

Here was the big downside . . . the LCD quit working after four days.  We took the camera in the water each day.  Never exceeded the fine print of only one hour in the water at a time.  Nor did we exceed the depth recommendations.  However, the lcd quit after taking it to a pool for about one hour on the 3rd day of the trip.  

Tried to contact tech support at Olympus, which promptly sent an automated reply that I would hear within 48 hours.  Over one week later, I received a disappointing email that stated I could send the camera back and may be responsible for the expense.

The camera shot great pictures . . . when it worked.  A brand new camera as well as a new product for Olympus should not be so unreliable.  Perhaps your purchase will not react the same way . . . but buyer beware.  Buy at your own risk!</Content>

<Content>This camera is NOT a replacement for a good DSLR. If you arent expecting that, you wont be disappointed by this Point and Shoot (PS) camera.

This camera offers strong features for a take it anywhere camera - water PROOF (to 30 feet) drop proof (to 6 feet) and dust proof. After a month of dragging it everywhere, I think the claims are real. Ive gotten it soaked, dropped it, and been in wind-blown dirt without any damage or crud appearing on my shots.

The camera also offers numerous metering modes for shooting. The auto exposure is current with todays best PS technology. Once you learn the menu system, you can get a good shot almost anywhere, and the default setting works well almost anywhere.

Yes, it is 10MP. No, it wont rival shots from a Canon 40D (unless you have really cheap glass on it). But you will get shots that dont fall apart into blurriness when you crop them or blow them up a bit, the colors will be good, and youll have it with you, in your pocket, not home in the camera bag.

Downsides? Sure, there are a few, and they will probably vary by personal taste. Mine include:
1. There is NO finder window, you MUST use the view screen to frame your shot. Its awkward for those of us accustomed to a view finder. But Ive learned... (and Im over 50, so you probably can too ;))
2. The menus are not complex, but there are a lot of options. There are settings that work for instant shots. But for more challenging situations there are great options - especially useful is the portrait flash options that let you highlight a face while not losing the background. It actually works as advertised.
3. The lens is limited in aperture. This type of camera does not let you stop down to f/11 for that perfect depth of field shot. You are shooting around f/5 and changing the exposure time as you select different settings. What it sees is what you get.
4. Its small. I have several great shots -- that feature my finger over the left 1/3 of the lens.
5. it has the usual metering delay of PS - so you cant take a TRULY instant shot - but there IS a feature called SHOOTSELECT - which takes about 8 shots in motor drive mode - you then pick one or more that you want to keep. (you must do it NOW - before going on to the next shot, and it does take a moment for them to save.) But for action shots of kids, its fun and works well. 

SUMMARY: For a camera you can throw in your kayak, drop off your bike, keep in your jacket pocket, and let your kids take pictures from the monkey bars without worrying about, this is the perfect fit.</Content>

This is a nice camera if youre looking primarily for a camera that is small, rugged, and waterproof.  However, if youre looking for a camera that takes great pictures - keep looking.  The image quality is terrible so forget the 10.1 mega pixel feature.  And since the 3.6 optical zoom is hardly enough to zoom in on far away objects the poor image quality becomes a big deal.  When you crop a photo in an attempt to zoom digitally, you can see terrible pixilation, grain, and blur.  

I considered sending the camera back to Amazon, but decided to keep it for taking photos in the water.  If I didnt want that feature I would have definitely returned it for something else.</Content>

<Content>This camera is really great. I typically hate having to take pictures on vacations with my family. I usually end up carrying the equipment and hate having to be careful not to damage it or get it wet while still trying to enjoy the my vacation to its fullest. 

I specifically purchase the Olympus 1030SW because of I wanted a rugged waterproof camera which would allow me to take picures of our vacation and still allow me to participate in all the action. This camera really fit the bill and I was able to take some really great action pictures while participating in the action. I actually enjoyed carrying the camera and snapping all the great pictures.

I just have a couple of suggestions that could be made to improve upon the the camera. First, add a view-finder to the camera. The view screen becomes useless under bright sunlight. The addition of the view-finder would help on these occasions. The second is to, of course, improve upon the view screen when in bright sunlight. On these occassions I was able to take the picture by aiming the camera in the general direction. Most of these pictures came out fine, but a view-finder would really help. 

Other than this I am glad I purchase this camera and cant wait till our next outing.</Content>

Then I noticed page 62 on the Instruction Manual where is says: During the conditions described below, power is consumed continuously and the battery becomes exhausted quickly: - The camera is connected to a computer or printer.

So, connecting the 1030 via USB doesnt charge the battery as anyone with a cell phone or PDA would expect, it actually kills it! Quickly! Connecting the camera and getting distracted for a few minutes means you have a dead battery and no more shooting for 2-3 hours while recharge it! This has to be the dumbest feature Ive ever seen on an electronic device. Am I just missing something?</Content>

<Content>Ive had the camera for about 3 weeks. Im very pleased. I own four other cameras and the 1030sw is fast becoming my favorite. The buttons make sense where they have them and the camera as a whole was definitely user friendly. 

Lots of extra goodies in the software to manipulate settings. And Im just as pleased with the closeups too.

I will be taking it to work in my lunch box for the sole purpose of getting pictures of train derailments and if you view the photo gallery I put half a dozen pics there that will speak for themselves. 

Yes the camera is spendy but if you want tough, and easy to pull out of a shirt pocket and use (quickly) this is it.

Ive broken many a point N shoot, so after seeing that, I figured this one would last a bit longer.  I just returned from Little Cayman.  The camera was dropped, it still worked; submerged in salt water, still worked; submerged in a pitcher of beer, still worked; and subjected to normal stresses found on a bouncing boat and it still works!  The battery lasted for several days prior to needing a recharge.  The UW pics turned out ok.  Most required some color correction but nothing horrible.  Id like if the camera would record in RAW.

<Content>Having just returned from a trip to Costa Rica and being disappointed with my older Kodak digital I started looking for a new camera.  The problems with the Kodak, which served me well for a number of years, were: didnt zoom enough, LCD screen was awful (I always used the viewfinder), horizon that was always off, battery life was good, but to recharge you had to lug the dock with you.  Another problem was the on/off lever, which, inside my day bag, kept getting turned on by mistake and wasting battery.

I looked at the Olympus because my favourite old film SLR was an Olympus manual.  This camera has a 3.6 optical zoom along with a digital zoom that takes it to 18-23X depending on your settings.  The menu is much easier to go through and I like the idiot proof sample pics on the menu to tell you exactly what each setting will mean.  Theres even sample pics through the viewfinder of the different light settings.  The on/off button is a much better design than the old Kodak.  The flash on/off is very easy.  I also like  snorkeling and thought that having a camera that could serve both above and underwater would mean having to lug one less camera along with me on trips.  I also liked the fact that the recharger was much, much smaller than the Kodak.  I was pleased to discover that it will also take underwater movies. The LCD screen is large and very easily viewed in all conditions.  My first pictures taken with the camera were very pleasing.  I tried a bunch of lighting conditions and the camera did well in all.  The only drawback that I can see is that when you push the camera up to 18-23X the pictures get a bit grainy, but that happens with all other cameras that Ive used and is to be somewhat expected.   The menu has such useful settings as: through glass, indoor, night, candle, etc. 

For those who like to do top notch HD zooms, this is not the camera for you and why would you be looking at this anyway.  For those who like a camera that will go anywhere with you and do most of the stuff a much larger camera does, this is a great buy</Content>

<Content>This was my first digital camera so I have not fully mastered the learning curve yet, but what I see so far is good. I found I could download pics without the Olympus software which is great. I discovered that I cannot see through the viewfinder AT ALL when trying to take outdoor pics - how do I fix that?!?!? It is like shooting blind for heavens sake. Resolution on pics is AWESOME. I gave it a dunk and it performed as advertised. Tough to find accessories but hopefully that will improve with time. I dislike being forced into Olympus brand accessories and need a car charger too but no luck so far. Guess that comes with jumping on a totally new camera very early on</Content>

<Content>The camera has cool features that you will not find on most digital cameras including the fact that it is crush proof, water proof, and freeze proof. These are all great but the quality of the pictures is lacking. I tried many different settings and set the size and the quality to the maximum size but the quality still suffered. I gave this camera 2 stars out of 5 because of the poor quality which is unacceptable for a camera at this price range and also the fact that this is the 3rd generation of these cameras. The quality of the pictures is more important to me than all of the features I mentioned above which is why I returned this camera and purchased a Canon Powershot SD790-IS. My previous camera was a Canon which I loved so I decided to stick with what I know will not disapoint me.

If somewhat grainy and fuzzy pictures do not bother you and you need something that can handle rough terrain, kids, or clumsy hands than this camera is for you. If you are like me and prefer nice quality photographs than I recommend you steer clear.</Content>

<Content>After 5 years with a 5MP Olympus Camedia C-50 with the underwater housing, I decided it was time to upgrade.  We only used the underwater housing to protect the camera from the elements when we went sailing.  We used it a couple of times to go snorkeling, but it wasnt worth the bulkiness of the housing.

So, that being said, I went looking for another camera that was waterproof--we could take it on the boat or for the occasional swim without buying an underwater housing.  The options were limited with the Pentax and the Olympus.  I went for the Olympus because we were happy with the old camera and still have a few xd cards.  I went for the 1030sw since it is the latest and greatest.  So far I am glad with my choice.

In the box:  The camera, USB cable (not the same camera connection as the old one), audio/video cable, microSD converter (put the microSD card in to fit into the xd space), Olympus Master Software, battery, and wall plug-in charger (no more cord--although the manual says in some areas a cord is still used).  No xd-card is included.  

I took the camera right out of the box and started playing.  I took videos of my dog and plenty of pictures of him, too.  I loved it!  It is strange to me not to have an eye viewfinder, but I am getting used to it.  It is super easy to use and I had so much fun dropping it in a bowl of water to test it out and having it work!  Ive ruined a camera before because it got wet, so this was the coolest feature!  

I bought the camera even though I knew it only took VGA video at 30fps for 10sec, which was a disappointment, but I figured I could live with it.  Well, after registering the camera a couple of days ago, I got an email this morning saying that an update to the firmware was available that would allow longer video at 30fps!  Yea!  I upgraded the firmware (through the provided software) and tried it out and it didnt work.  Then I re-read the email--an M+ or H xd card is required.  The older (or cheaper) M xd cards dont allow for the longer videos at 30fps.  So, I ran out and bought a 2GB M+ xd card and sure enough, I can take VGA videos at 30fps for as long as the card can hold.  That does away with that negative!

Lets get down to the pros and cons:
Pros:  
*small  lightweight, 
*takes nice pictures, 
*easy to change settings (a quick click on the ok button and you can change settings, 
*lots of available features on the camera itself (it even has a selection that will guide you for certain things), 
*nice big LCD

Cons: 
*the xd card--just about every other camera out there uses an SD card and computers dont have built-in xd reading capability, 
*it doesnt have a remote to take group photos--the c-50 did and I loved it because I didnt have to set the timer and run into the picture--Im going to miss that,
*it is easy to get your finger in front of the lens--I will have to learn to keep my fingers off to the side.

It doesnt have all the features of an SLR, but hey, it isnt an SLR!  For a point and shoot, it does enough for me.  I have the SLR for the big projects and this is for the times when I dont want something bulky and want to take pictures.  I cant wait to take it on the boat or snorkeling! 

I highly recommend this camera for someone looking for a sturdy camera that is waterproof (not just all weather) and easy to carry around. Go for the M+ xd card for the video capability (I went for the 2GB).  I would also recommend protective covering for the LCD (Im thinking about the silicone cover, too).   An extra battery is always nice, too, but it doesnt seem necessary so far--Ive been playing with it for 3 days running around taking videos and pictures and it still shows a full battery even though I dont think I even charged the battery all the way when I first got it because I was so excited to play with the camera.</Content>

<Content>I spend a lot of time on and in the water and I bought this camera to stick in my pocket and go.  It is very good for that.  For general purpose use though it is poor-to-mediocre in comparison to other point and shoot digitals at this price that I looked at.  I usually shoot slide film/ SLR, but I figured for the price this camera would probably take acceptable pictures.

The good: the macro mode works very well and is fun to use.  The underwater thing is as cool as it sounds.  The camera is well built and rugged and easy to carry around.  The battery life is outstanding.  All in all it should be a great outdoors persons pocket camera

The bad.  The biggest problem (and it is a huge one) is the horrible program mode system.  The lack of an aperture or shutter priority setting is a major, major issue in light of the bizarre pre-sets on this camera. 

For starters, the camera sets the aperture wide open, no matter what youre actually trying to take a picture of.  I shot about 150 pictures in Landscape and Portrait  Landscape modes last week and every time the camera set the aperture to the max allowed by the zoomed lens, usually f/3.5.  Even if you point it at a fluorescent light or bright water (so there are no low-light issues) it does not stop down.  This is stupid.  It means that the only thing in focus in most of the landscape photos was a tree-branch in the foreground or some guys hat.  There is no manual override.  Apparently it is a fixed aperture camera.  The only way is to zoom to the max which only has a max aperture of up to 5.6 or so.  Of course this means that the wide angle feature is useless for landscapes.  

Even if you manage to get an appropriate f-stop, the camera has a problem picking appropriate ISO and shutter speeds, especially in low light.  It seems to prioritize for low ISO, meaning that it also slows the shutter speed down, resulting in blurry and noisy photos.  A speed of 1/40s with ISO 80 is pretty useless in terms of getting good handheld pictures vs speed of 1/250 and ISO 200, for example.  Using the LED seems to fix this in the Macro mode but in other modes the camera insists on reducing shutter speed and opening up the lens inappropriately.  You can set the ISO manually but the modes are fiddly and its easy to forget if you switch back and forth a lot.

Finally my autofocus simply refuses to focus on anything more than about 70 away.  Even if I confirm spot-focus before shooting on a distant object it will be blurry in the final picture, while random closer objects are in focus.      

It is possible that there is something wrong with the camera I have as I cant imagine anyone designed it this way (right?).  However I went to a local camera store and tried their two display models and had the same issues.  Its going back.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for an upcoming trip to Costa Rica for 3 months. I wanted something lightweight and rugged - and this fit the bill. I normally use a Canon Powershot S2 IS - this is my first camera outside of the Cannon family, and Ive had quite a few dating back to the Canon AE-1 SLR. I was sold by the Olympus 1030SW because of its underwater capabilities, and its crushproof-ness. My Canon Elf traveled around in my pocket to all the college clubs and parties, and eventually the LCD screen broke. Since that, I have been more aware of how neglectful I can be of my electronics, so I was willing to pay the $$ to have a camera that is practically indestructible. I have yet to test the underwater capabilities. 

I looked at the 790SW model, but was interested in greater underwater depth capability, and after checking them both out at my local retailer, I liked the feel of the 1030 - it just seemed to be more heavy duty. 

I have been very impressed with the pictures Ive taken so far. For a point and shoot, I really like the range of options I have. The macro function performs nicely, in both low and high lighting conditions. The natural light mode is by far my favorite, I personally dislike photos that look whitewashed by a flash when its hardly necessary to the photo. On auto the pictures look good - your average point and shoot. The shutter speed is much better than my Cannon S2, and so far the battery life has been great as well. Many of the features I havent had a chance to use in the month Ive had the camera, but if I have any issues Ill be sure to update this review!

Im giving it 4 stars because of the price. You pay a premium at this point because it was just released and for all the shockproof/waterproof/etc capabilities. If thats what you are looking for, then its great. If you are looking for excellent quality photos, and dont care much about where the camera goes and what conditions it works in, then Id shop around for a more affordable option. 

Ill update this post CR with results from the trip...</Content>

<Content>Bought this a little over a week ago, just after testing my underwater housing for my Canon S30 and finding it was leaking.  We were leaving for five days of snorkeling in Cozumel and I wanted to be able to take underwater pictures.  The Stylus 1030SW really fit the bill.  Got a 2GB Olympus card and spare battery.  The card was more than enough capacity and I was really pleased with how many shots I could take on a single battery charge.  Over the 5 days I took over 800 photos and one battery usually lasted most of the day, even though I had the camera on most of the time I was in the water.  Im sure I surface dove to 15 and 20 ft a number of times, so, the 1030 was a better solution for me than the 850 would have been.  I also really like the wider angle (effective 28mm).  Camera worked great underwater and for other vacation shots.  I usually turned the flash off underwater since shots taken with it would have lots of spots from reflection off all the little bubbles and stuff in the water, but, got some real nice fish  coral photos anyway.  It can be tough to see the LCD in real bright conditions, and, the black is just paint (one time when getting out I got trown by a wave and slammed the camera into the coral bottom scratching the paint but otherwise the camera was uneffected).  Im very impressed with the quality of the photos this little camera is giving me, the range of adjustments, and, after a fairly short learning curve, the ability to adjust the settings pretty easily.  I also got the floating strap which does keep this heavy little beast from going to the bottom if you happen to lose hold of it.  Im very pleased with this camera so far and looking forward to using it a lot, particularly taking it along biking, hiking, camping and other active outdoor uses.</Content>

<Content>This camera is OK. The wide zoom and durability features are great for the way my department it - to take pictures of construction sites. There is one big problem, though: Olympus built software into this camera that prevents the xD card from being read in anything other than an Olympus card reader. 

When I called Olympus tech support for a solution, their response was rude and aggravating. The tech basically told me they did this because they sell a card reader, and if I wanted to use a card reader, I had to buy theirs. Or, I could plug the camera into the PC. I sent the letter below to Olympus tech support email. It will be interesting to see if/how they respond. 

MY LETTER TO OLYMPUS TECH SUPPORT AFTER A BAD TELEPHONE SUPPORT EXPERIENCE: 

I just bought a new Stylus 1030SW for my department. I thought it was a great little camera, until I needed some tech support. 

Heres the problem: 
This is a department camera. The goal was to make it available to all of my product managers, and let each of them have their own storage cards. We need the ability to read the storage cards through a card reader, because plugging the camera into the PC is not practical. Ive never had a problem with this in the past, and I own an Olympus C7070 Wide Zoom that works fine. Unfortunately, with this new Stylus, when I plug into the card reader, I get an error message that the card needs to be formatted. If I format the card in the reader, when I put it back in the camera, the camera says it needs to format the card. Ugh!

I need a solution that does not involve plugging the camera directly into the PC (impractical because the camera might be out on another job) and does not involve buying an additional card reader (impractical because I already have a multi-card reader plugged into my PC, and I use it to read cards from other cameras, and I dont need any more network drive conflicts right now).

Please provide an acceptable solution. I would hate to have to return this camera, because I like the size and functionality. I just dont like the inclusion of proprietary software that doesnt add any consumer benefits.</Content>

<Content>     I bought this camera because of the ability to plunk it in the water. . . But Im still returning it as you will read. 

     I consider myself a skilled serious amateur photographer and currently own two Panasonic Lumix cameras (LX-1  LX-2). When I shoot photos I am apt to change the exposure value for photos, consciously choose the f-stop and shutter speed when the conditions are less than ideal, and I am highly conscious of lighting and framing issues.

     But I swim and wanted to take underwater movies for my stroke analysis.  I earlier bought a DiCAPac plastic enclosure for my Panasonic but decided to stop using the enclosure after the plastic began to tear along the opening seam.  So when I found the Olympus 1030SW I thought great! I can shoot underwater movies without a housing!

     The Good. . . . I really like the shadow compensation technology.  You can actually accomplish it in the computer but it is kind of cool to have it as a feature in the camera.  I also like the length of time that the battery lasts before it needs to be recharged.  The camera has a led light that you can choose to illuminate macro shots. This is a great feature if you  intend to do close up macro shots. You can use the led as an emergency small light in the hotel room on vacation (if you can find the button).  There is also a built-in alarm clock that could be quite handy. THe arrow pad control was intuitive.  The camera has built in controls to modify or manipulate images (black and white, cropping, framing it, color manipulation) for those who dont have a computer.  I do, however, question the ability to actually see the image well enough on the camera screen to intelligently modify the image in the camera.

     The not so good. . . . The most annoying feature of the camera is that you must be very careful that you dont put your finger in front of the lens window.  Its very easy to do; I know, I did it even though I was aware of the problem. 

I do understand that this camera is designed to be used by the occasional photographer, but at $350 (I paid $400 at Amazon when it first came out) it seems that there should be at least some ability to consciously choose some settings without having to go into the Mode Dial SCN selection menu to find a comparable scene.
     The Mode Dial has the following settings:
AUTO: Shooting pictures with full automatic settings. The camera determines the optimum settings for the shooting conditions automatically It changes ISO [sensitivity and color balance settings I think] - This is basically the point and shoot mode.
Program auto: Set the optimum aperture value and shutter speed. The camera automatically sets the optimum aperture value and shutter speed for the brightness of the subject.  I didnt really try to figure it out, but I never did understand the difference between AUTO and PROGRAM AUTO modes.
IMAGE STABILIZATION MODE: Shooting pictures using digital image stabilization. This function reduces the blur caused by a moving subject or camera movement when taking pictures.  So I wonder why there is a mode just for this rather than having a single button to turn it on and off? So is it like the Program Auto, or the Auto mode with image stabilization? Quien sabe?
SCN mode: Shoot pictures by selecting a scene mode according to the situation. You can shoot pictures by selecting a scene mode according to the situation.  So there are more than a dozen scenes that you are supposed to scroll down through to find one similar to the one you are going to shoot.  Heres the list PORTRAIT / LANDSCAPE / LANDSCAPE +PORTRAIT / NIGHT SCENE*1 /NIGHT+PORTRAIT*1 / SPORT / INDOOR / CANDLE*1 / SELF PORTRAIT /AVAILABLE LIGHT*1 / SUNSET*1 / FIREWORKS*1 / CUISINE / BEHIND GLASS /DOCUMENTS / AUCTION*2 / SHOOT  SELECT1*2 / SHOOT  SELECT2*3 /BEACH  SNOW / PRE-CAPTURE MOVIE / UNDERWATER SNAPSHOT*4 /
UNDERWATER WIDE1*4 / UNDERWATER WIDE2*4*5 / UNDERWATER MACRO.  So what is a poor bloke to do?  I know.  Oh wait! Let me shoot the picture of you, Johnnie, blowing out the candles. Margot! Tell him to wait!  Now, Hmmm.  Where was that mode? I know there supposed to be a way to take a picture of my kiddie blowing out a candle if youll just give me a minute to find it. . . . 

    Methinks the various scenes that you can select thru the SCN mode probably address lighting issues, light color issues, etc. But still! It is too impractical to use it. I doubt many will ever use it though Olympus may try to push it as a selling point.

    Now, we come to the reason that I returned the camera.  I play golf as well so today I went to use the camera in the movie mode for the first time in order to record my swing on video[swimming was to be later this week].  I had already set the camera to the VGA movie mode but when I pushed the button it turns out that you can only record ten seconds of video in VGA mode! Thats ridiculous.  There must be a lack of horsepower under the hood that it cant stream that resolution to the memory card, but it can in the QVGA mode since the resolution is less good. So, when I go to Hawaii in a couple of months and I want to shoot a video of my wife snorkeling with the dolphins in the water Ill be able to get ten seconds of video. Sounds peachy keen! That combined with the the dismal ability to choose the aperture and f-stop make it a sure returner for me. So sorry. . . :(

So, Im returning it despite the fact I bought a silicone skin, two extra batteries and two 2gb memory cards.

<Content>I received this camera a few days ago and have been putting it through its paces.  I live in Hawaii, so have been using it while at the beach and free diving.  For me, this is an ideal point and shoot camera.

I feel that the image quality is great.  I may not have a very good eye to judge this, but my experience says that most cameras produce good images when used correctly.  Poor images are more due to the user than the camera.  I was impressed with the menu controls and how much explanation is on the camera itself (I especially like the on camera guide).  Compared to my other cameras (Canon SD600 and Sony DCR-PC350 video camera with 3 MP still support) the menu system is much improved and easier to use.  This is my first Olympus camera, so I cant compare it too prior models.  I really like how I can use the full auto feature for simplicity, but the camera can guide me through more detailed situations using either the scene menu or the guide.

Physically, I was impressed with this camera.  It is rather heavy, but feels very solid.  For the first time, I feel like I can take a camera anywhere with little worries.  I already dropped it on a hike in some mud and just pored some water on it and kept shooting.  This, to me, is well worth the slight price premium for this camera.  I simply couldnt get these pictures before without an expensive housing.  The dial on the back of the camera is difficult to use, but a minor inconvenience.

I was rather impressed with the in camera panoramic function.  If you take your time, it can give you good results.</Content>

<Content>I, after much research, purchased this camera about a week ago.  Since then I have shot about 100 pictures both indoors and out, on cloudy and sunny days.  I have also shot quite a few macro photos on both manual and automatic settings.  I have experimented with some the scene modes.  I have not tested the movie mode and have not dropped it, frozen it or submerged it yet (however I am going snorkeling in the Bahamas next month).  The build design is definitely rugged and the fit and finish is excellent.  This is the best built point and shoot I have ever handled.  The LCD is big and bright and the buttons and menus are well designed and laid out.  Flash seems consistent with other point and shoots in this category (so-so).

Photo Quality:  For the most part I am pleased with the photos, especially those taken close up using all three of the macro modes.  Outdoor pictures in sunlight were sharp and clear.  Cloudy day photos lacked a little sharpness that I felt I got more of with my Canon 870 however I also think that I need to experiment with the spot metering focus mode versus the ESP metering mode.  I know my Canon had 9 point AiAf focusing which seemed to make more objects in the photo in focus.  I dont think this camera has the same type of focusing system.  I havent really tried the face recognition feature that much but it did work when I tried it in the store prior to purchasing.  The color reproduction seems accurate to me and the photos I took outdoors on a sunny day seemed to really pop.  Indoor photos seemed overly noisy however this has been consistent with other point and shoots that I have owned (Canon S500 and 870).  

Value:  The price of this camera is admittedly high however it does offer features that other point and shoots in this category dont.  The crush, freeze and water resistant features are compelling.  I typically have very high expectations for items that I purchase and initially was a little disappointed with this camera.  However as I use it more and take more pictures with it I am becoming increasingly satisfied.  Its not a digital SLR and it doesnt have a lot of manual controls, viewfinder, light-up-the-night-sky flash, etc.  It is a very well built, extremely rugged and water proof (to 33ft) 10MP digital camera with a decent LCD, zoom and software that takes good point and shoot quality photos.

<Content>Just got the green version last week as a tougher and easier-to-carry replacement for my Canon S60, then went on a weekend trip to the beach with the family.  We split our time and pictures between hotel room, pool, and beach, so we got pictures in a bunch of different settings and lighting conditions.

Overall, I have to say the pictures all leaned toward muddy, with weak color, and simply not so good.  Slow focusing was a consistent problem.  Maybe I have been spoiled by my earlier cameras (this is my first non-Canon compact digicam), but Olympus has no excuse for making such a mediocre camera in this price range.  I know they can do better, they just dont seem to be trying.  If Olumpus is skimping on the camera to pay for making it tough and still hit the $399 MSRP price point, they should consider just putting in the effort to make it a good camera and charging $449.  I would have given a good camera a better review (I only pay for the camera once, but I use it 8,000 times).

I gave it an extra star for being so immersable and droppable, which is totally cool.  It made me feel better when my five-year-old would pick it up and start snapping.

For the nearly $400, I simply expected a better camera.  This one will get returned.</Content>

<Content>I bought the green Olympus Stylus 1030SW after losing a 770SW that I had for 6 months. Yes, its crush proof, ice proof, heat proof, drop proof and water proof but not loss proof!

It seems Olympus have fixed all the bits I did not like about the previous model. The fidgety controls and menu system are now much easier to use. The spec has been significantly upgraded with the widescreen lense (not so wide that you notice a huge different but nice all the same), 3.6x zoom and much better video capabilities as well as the ability to take 10MP shots. There is a huge array of scene modes for every possible need with a helpful multi multi-devided screen view for trying out different ISO settings.

From 3 days of playing with it I really like what I see, its very rugged although i would have liked a viewfinder for those moments in the wilderness where the battery is dying or sun is shining on the LCD. The green model is much nicer in reality then it looks online (British Racing Green is the color-name in the UK FYI). It comes with a helpful MASD connector so if you have a microSD card lying about, it will fit the xD style adaptor and fit in the camera. So far it hasnt slowed the camera down at all. I cant wait to get it out kayaking or skiing some day to really put it to the test.</Content>

<Title>Samsung S860 8.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver)</Title>
<EditorialReviews>
<EditorialReview>
<Content>The Samsung S860 is a high-resolution digital camera that is equipped with a true-color filtered 8.1-Megapixel CCD. This allows the Samsung S860 to take detailed photos for printing up to poster size. With the Face Detection AF  AE function, the Samsung S860 enables the user to take better portrait pictures more easily. This function detects faces and automatically focuses on them. The brightness of the faces is adjusted optimally for beautiful portrait pictures. In macro shooting, it is now possible to take clear, natural pictures. Digital Image Stabilization (DIS) technology  prevents the degradation of image clarity and color, which is sometimes found in flash photography. With DIS the effects of image blur are reduced in lower light conditions.

<Content>Bought this camera for my 9 year old niece.  She loves it (especially because its pink) but was upset that it only took about 3 pictures. The camera did not come with any memory card, which was very disappointing, so she now has to go out and buy one. Most cameras usually come with a minimum of 32MB, (at least they used to).  Otherwise its easy to use, and the viewfinder is nice and clear.</Content>

<Content>I think this camera is probably fine but it felt like one of those old digital cameras from earlier this decade.  For example it used double AA batteries instead of a rechargeable.  The processing speed for each picture was incredibly slow (actually might be slower than my Canon from 2002) and it felt light and plastic-y, just cheap.  However that being said it is incredibly affordable and if I did not have another camera to use I probably would have kept this one because the price was so good.  Since I returned the item I cannot say anything in terms of its longevity.  
However, seller was great, shipping was fast and return was very easy.</Content>

I needed a camera to take pictures of my kids at sporting events, classroom pictures and for awards nights. It takes great pictures and even video. It is small and fits into my cargo pockets. I have medium size hands and the camera is easy to hold and the display easy to read. I am very pleased with it. For those of you who read this, it is a great point and shoot camera. I do recommend it for that purpose.</Content>

<Content>I loved this camera after I got it. I was upgrading from a 3.1MP, so the pictures I took looked amazing. However, after only 3 months, the camera is not operable at all. When I try to power it on, it simply beeps 3 times and shuts off. The lens wont retract either. After searching the internet for a solution, I find this is a common, known problem and seems to be no solution. My only option is to send it back to Samsung who will replace it with an identical one that will probably malfunction in the same manner.</Content>

<Content>I was pleased with this camera for awhile after i bought it for my girlfriend. Then the problems began. This camera has had numerous problems with freezing, requiring you to remove batteries and reboot. The camera would not work for a 2 week span of time to no avail and we found out it was because it requires rechargeable batteries. Even when you use high quality batteries the results are all over the charts. Sometimes the camera stays powered for a great amount of time. Other times it has literally ran out of juice within 20 pictures. So overall, while it takes quality pictures for the price, i would easily choose to try another camera over this one if i had the chance.

<Content>I bought this for my niece as an entry level digital camera.  It  took decent pictures, especially for the price ($84).  However, after 2 months of light use it quit working.  It gave an error message to replace the batteries, even with several sets of new batteries.  It would also freeze in the open position, or refuse to turn on.  It may be a fine camera and we got a lemon, but I will try a different model next time. </Content>

<Content>I got this camera as a gift. I like it very much,  it takes great shots. I dont expect it to compete against my DSLR camera, its not made like that.
I use this camera instead of keeping my bigger camera in the vehicle daily. It tucks away quite easily in its case,  can be used rather quickly.
The picture quality is fantastic, there are a few things you can tweak with it, but auto does a fine job. As with most pocket cameras, its in the jpg format. The picture depth is quite nice.
I like that it uses AA batteries,  that you can tell the camera if youre using alkaline or rechargables.
The shutter lag can be annoying, when youre trying to get a fast shot (the reason to have this camera, for me), but its digital, small  easy. 
The amount of time between shots, isnt too bad really (of course these things are affected by battery,  card).

One thing I wish it had, is delete during save. I love this feature on my much older HP pocket. I will say that you can set the instant review to be a little longer,  the stored shot review is a quick button.
As with most pocket cameras, you shoot via the lcd screen. A bit hard to get accustomed to, but does make shooting easier.
I would suggest picking one up. Do a comparison on the camera you want, dont expect it to take a picture of the ring around the moon, its not made for that. One final thing, it has a kid action setting that is pretty good for cats as well.</Content>

<Content>I like the features and size of the camera, but the LCD screen cracked with very little pressure applied to it while it was packed in a bag.  I only had the s860 for two weeks and now it is unusable.  Of course Samsung considers that physical damage and will not warranty that, even though I think the amount of force it took to break is unacceptable.  Consider this a disposable camera unless you constantly carry it in a box of feathers.</Content>

I havent used all the features yet, just getting familiar with it, but I love it--easy to use, and the battery life is excellent! I have an older Pentax Optio that just eats batteries, even recharged ones, within minutes, but not this Samsung beauty! I havent printed any pictures yet, but I am sure they will be great. This sounds silly, but I may get another one in a few months, just to have a spare.
I would buy this camera from this seller again.  I recommend it.</Content>

<Content>This is an easy to use camera if you are just using the factory settings to point and shoot. There are some really cool other things: the camera takes 2 AA batteries, it is flat and small, uses both SD and HCSD cards and it is inexpensive. This is a good camera for trips, showing clients information about products if in a service industry or for video testimonials. There has been a few times where the camera has not taken a clear photo so you may have to take duplicates but that is rare. If you are looking for a camera that does a ton of tricks this one is not for you. </Content>

<Content>Bought this for my grand daughter. I own high end P/S and SLR cameras and I wasnt expecting much for this price. Let me tell you this camera greatly exceeded my expectations. It has a lot of high end P/S camera features. It is the first camera that I have seen that allows you to zoom while using the video. It does take a little longer to write to the SD card after taking a picture than any other camera Ive owned but thats a minor annoyance, maybe a faster SD card could cure that. The features are easy to use and intuitive. The screen is a nice size and clear. Its a very small size camera and one you can take anywhere as it will fit in pocket or purse easily. All in all its a very good camera at a very good price and I highly recommend it. One major annoyance with this camera is that when you turn it on it will always go to the red eye reduction flash setting and will flash 2-3 times before taking the flash picture. This will cause you to miss the picture you want as after the first flash fires, you will think the picture was taken and you will move the camera. The camera does not remember the last flash setting you had when you turned it off. Its a real pain to have to fool with the flash settings every time you turn this camera on, unless you like red eye reduction every time you turn it on.    </Content>

<Content>This Samsung S860 is my first serious camera since someone stole my hi-end Pentaxes 13 years -- and a whole technology -- ago. Therefore, I had zero experience with digital photography.

So I bought this camera in pink, hoping that pink would make it less attractive to the macho thieves of South America, where I took it on vacation. No one stole it. Learning the basics, I took about 300 pictures in a month. Some of them were awful but that was mostly me. It wants to take good pictures, you just have to learn how to let it do so, read the manual, stuff like that. It also took some very hard travel knocks and kept working. The view screen is a bit dim in bright light, but you learn to shade it with your hand. My first set of AA batteries lasted me over 120 pictures. Still a record. It wont work at all on lesser batteries than top-end alkalines. The computer download software looked hinky but works fine. It cost me $80 with a 2 gig chip. Its not a Canon but it takes pictures just as easily and as good as my partners ELPH does and cost me 40 percent as much.</Content>

I bought rechargeable batteries for it because we were burning through regular batteries. It has frozen up a couple of times, but we just pop the battery door and turn it back on and its fine. Overall, a good camera for what I bought it for.</Content>

<Content>Camera has lots of features for its price. Its picture quality however is not as sharp.   All my indoor picture comes out quite grainy, regardless of the distance from the object.   I am not sure if the flash is not strong enough, or the lens is the problem.</Content>

It takes great pictures, but what I didnt know when I bought this is that it takes pictures in black and white, sepia, and all sorts of other formats.  My daughter LOVES all that and has taken some amazing pictures.  I would definitely recommend this camera, and would buy it again.</Content>

<Content>My 2 cents:

For me this was like an expensive disposable camera - I bought it for a situation which I knew could get me in trouble to save the camera, and sure enough it was gone after 2 weeks, but thats another story.

Shutter speed is not particularly fast (long response time from pressing the shutter button to actual picture taking.), and flash and image quality not very good either.
It can take videos though, so that could be an appeal for you YouTube junkies.

Ultimately, if you can save another hundred or so, there are some VERY good cameras in the $200-250 range, like a Sony Cybershot DSC-T70 8.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization (Silver).

Not really recommended.</Content>

<Content>I bought this camera for my 8 year old son as a Christmas present.  The display and the price were the two reasons I chose it.  Overall I am satisfied with the camera since it is serving my son well but I have noticed that it has a distinct lag between pressing the shutter release and the actual picture snapping.  I know it is a common occurrence with digital cameras, but it seems a bit more pronounced with this one.  I would recommend this to someone looking for a beginner or first camera, but expect to out grow it in a year</Content>

<Content>Well the product arrived on time as scheduled, and it was in good condition. However, I am not satisfied with it ,so I am planning to send it back. First of all, whoever sold it did not specify that it was not rechargeable, besides you cannot take pictures with it when you zoom it. You can only take a snap short if the object is close to you, but if it is a bit far you cannot . I was disappointed when I tried to take photographs at a graduation ceremony from my seat. It was like bones before a Cat. Very disappointing indeed. You have to buy a recheargeable dry cell battry to use. Can I get a better deal for my money. I am a student so I cannot aford to loose or waste that money.

The day after i got it, i took it with me to go sledding with my friend and we went down the big hill while filming with this camera and caught the whole moment all the way! the sound was very good, it recorded it all nicely, and played it back was fun and easy to do! The manual mode and portrait mode were also very good too, the pics i took came out nice and bright when taking it in dimmer areas with the flash on. the stabilization mode couldve been a little better though, but otherwise if your looking for a regular standard camera to use then you should definetly get this camera! its east to use once you play with the modes a little, and good for the price too3 Oh, and also maybe buy some rechargable batteries and a good memory card for more pics and longer life, but its a good standard point and shoot digital camera if your just using it for regular activities unless your looking for a really top camera for profession/buisness. It captures great memories3</Content>

But Im glade I did wait! Now I can me 100% sure of my rating. Dont wait if your thinking about buying this, just buy it! And buy it from these guys! Came like 7 days BEFORE the delivery day, and the unit works great! Id get the biggest card like a 2-4 gb to take your photos with and invest in 4 rechargeable batteries and the recharge unit, because they go quick! But besides that, this little digital camera does it all for under $90! I know nothing about taking pictures, and you dont need to know a thing with this unit, because it does it all for you!!!! VERY HAPPY AND BUY THIS IF YOUR NOT SURE, JUST DO IT! YOU WONT BE SORRY! GREAT STORE AND FAST DELIVERY!!!!! VERY HAPPY-THANKS AMAZON!!!!</Content>

I had some trouble with the camera at first, but once I bought some expensive energizer lithium batteries, everything has worked out fine. I would reccommend this camera to anyone. I absoloutely love the face detection.

<Content>I bought this camera for my daughter for her birthday in June. By mid-July it had stopped focusing. The manager at the local RadioShak store where I purchased it was kind enough to do a swap, although hes not supposed to do that. The new camera lasted almost through the summer. Again it stopped focusing and the lense would not retract when the camer is powered-off. It beeps a few times, but nothing else happens. Now she wants a new camera for Christmas. Ive sent this one back to Samsung for repair/replacement as its still under the one year warranty, but Ive now seen two of these fail within months. Both myself and my daugher have lost confidence and are not convinced that the repaired/replaced unit will last any longer. Spend your money wisely. Spend a little more and buy a Canon or Nikon...</Content>

<Content>This camera took OK pictures until it broke after only 3 months.   Samsung customer service conveniently claimed physical damage so that they did not have to cover the repair.  I appealed to their Case Management since I knew there was no physical damage that caused the camera to stop working.  They had no interest in hearing anything I had to say  and only rudely repeated Samsung will not be covering any repairs.  This process took 3 weeks and was a complete waste of my time.  Samsung does not stand behind their products.   Do not buy Samsung products.</Content>

<Content>Ive had my S860 since May 2008.  Its stood up to heavy use for over 6 months!!!  I needed a reliable point  shoot to use on my Girl Scout outings and something that was small enough to keep in my briefcase to take those spur of the moment pics of my family, friends  pets!  
This little camera does it all!!!
I especially like that I can take over 400+ photos on my 2G SD card - on one set of rechargeable AA batteries.  This came in handy this past weekend while @ a b-day party for a friend - when her camera quit taking photos after only 5 shots!  I was able to keep snapping away for over 4 hours  provided the b-day girl with some great shots of her with her friends!
*Bottom line*
Its a great camera for those who need something reliable  rugged.  
The 8.1 MP is plenty if you want to crop  print larger photos!

<Content>Simply too slow at taking pictures for me to deal with.  Between the time you push the shutter button down and when the actual shot is taken who knows what your picture will look like.  Bottom line is the processor inside this camera is way too slow.  Even if you manage to take your first picture its going to take you another 5-8 seconds to take another one because of the time it takes to save each image onto the SD drive.  

On a side note this camera only lasted about 1 month because of my punishing nights out in boston.  The first night out i dropped it.  The second time i took it out it was freezing up, likely due to the first time i dropped it.  It did not make it past the 2nd night and was found crushed the next morning.  The SD card was recoverable though. Next camera is going to be the olyumpus 1030sw......  </Content>

<Content>I purchased the Samsung S860(silver) over a month ago. Ive been pleasently surprised how well this little camera has performed for me. The value is well worth the price tag.

The little thing did have a few more functions then I thought I would ever need or use...but Ive used a number of them including the video function(having bought a 2GB memory card first however.

After almost 2 months now of a lot of use and Im still learning about this little giant...working out well!

I recomend this camera for beginners and for those that need a second or third camera to carry(even tho its a shade larger then most in its class)Youll also want extra set batteries to carry with you...but having a good supply of rechargable batts works just fine!

<Content>The last cameria I got was in 2002, so figured it was time.  After looking over the avaiolable ones, I picked the one with the features I wanted at a really terrific price (was looking for control and zoom in and out, got it, but got a lot more).

All the controls are great and I can even do a time exposure on it (took great pictures for Halloween of glow in the dark ghosts).  

It is easy to use, small, stores lots of photos and has features that help you take better photos.

If there is any shortcoming it is the manual, I had to figure out how to take time exposures by myself (set on scene, be in dark, have a tripod and you got it) and a lot of the other features are not detailed for all the special things that they do, I suppose its like a marriage, no manual, but every day you learn something that makes it special.

<Content>My parents bought me this camera for my birthday to start out my photography, which I have grown in love with. Although not as effective as SLRs, the pictures come out beautifully. My sisters Nikon D40 has 8.4 megapixels, while this one is only .3 below it.

The modes come in handy for different environments. There is even a mode that teaches you how to use the camera. In certain modes you can control the ISO of the image, sharpness, color filters, size, and many other things.

I use my camers so much and so far the only bad thing i have found out is that if you keep it plugged into the computer when importing pictures, and forget to turn it off, the battteries will die. The best thing to do is buy the rechargeable energizer betteries. I recommend this camera to anyone who is a cheapscape for good qualiaty cameras. BUY IT!</Content>

<Content>Bought this camera for my daughters 13th birthday.  Purchased a pink one for her 11 year old sister as well with 2Gb cards too.  They love the video function of the camera.  Wasnt long they were making home videos and playing them back for everyone.  It takes 2 AA batteries which seem to last pretty long.  The delay time from picture to picture is a little longer than I would like but it seems okay for them.  Also the picture delay from when you press the button to the actual picture taken is okay, could be a little faster too.  The image stabilization seems good given the skill of the kids.

Would highly recommend this camera for a great entry level digital camera.</Content>

<Content>Samsung S860 8.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver)  Very disappointed.  Because of other duties, I didnt open the camera package until several weeks after receipt.  Read simple booklet included and thought this should be easy enough.  Took 2 quick photos to be sure Id gotten it right since this was my FIRST camera other than an old Polaroid.  However, within 20 minutes camera stopped functioning.  While attempting to take the 3rd photo of my new kitten,the image suddenly disappeared and I saw nothing but a plain white blank screen.  Put the camera aside for a few days, then called tech support.  When removing batteries for 30 seconds didnt work, as was suggested, I was told Id have to send in the camera since there seemed to be an internal error.  First time Ive ever been disappointed with a Samsung product.  Regardless, Im very unhappy at the moment.

<Content>I chose this camera because I was on a strict budget, but (obviously) looking for the highest quality camera on the market. Ive had this Samsung for a few weeks now, and have not been disappointed at all! The photographs are easy to take and come out gorgeous thanks to the 8.1 megapixels. There are also a variety of basic features and settings you can play around with in addition to the automatic one. The lag between the actual taking of a picture and when you can take another one is longer than I had hoped, but not unbearable. That is why I rated it only 4 out of 5 stars. This is a great camera for the price, I would definitely reccomend it for a friend. </Content>

The AA batteries meant she didnt have to worry about charging, and taking extra kit.  It has good zoom and face recognizing function, takes video and has different image functions. For $90 it was a bargain, I didnt buy the SD card with it though because, it shipped separately  and incurred a shipping fee, so we bought that a local electronics store. Havent seen it at the same price since though. </Content>

<Content>I hate this camera. Wish I could return it . I did just get i back from  repair under warranty and it still isnt right. 
It will not power on.. Sometimes if I jiggle the batteries it will come on, sometimes not. Sometimes taking the batteries out and putting them back in works, sometimes not. Real fun when you are trying to take a picture!
The last thing that happened before I returned it was the shutter stuck open.
I got it back today, put in two brand new AA batteries ( the recommended ones) and it still doesnt come on.
So......I learned that my next camera will not have AA batteries!
I am envious of you that have no problems with it.</Content>

<Content>I wanted an inexpensive camera that I could throw in my bag when I travel.  My last camera, a Canon A70, was ruined by the constant banging around, even in its case.  This Samsung is by no means as good as the Canon, but its a very good little camera for the price.  The resolution is excellent when in bright light.  Beach photos were beautiful when the subjects were in the sun.  When in the shade of an umbrella, they were a little too dark, even when the focus boxes on the viewfinder showed it should have been metering for the shade.  But I was able to lighten them with Corel Photo Pro.  Photos of water splashes were caught in mid air and in focus, not blurred.  

There is a lag time between when you press the button and when the photo is taken, even after youve pressed halfway to focus.  Much slower than my Canon.  That lag time is my main complaint with this camera.  Outdoor, its not too much of a problem.  But I had a heck of a time photographing my granddaughter on an indoor carousel.  I had to take the photo about 2 seconds before she would be in front of me. It was a real guessing game.  

But this camera is so inexpensive, I cant fault it too much.  I will buy something better when Im not going to be subjecting it to rough handling. </Content>

<Content>My son bought this camera for himself along with the accessory kit from Amazon for under $100.  

I have been messing around with it to compare it to my Fujifilm F50fd, these are the features that I noticed that mine does not have...

1. Theres an in camera help option, so you dont need to refer to the manual.
2. While filming in movie mode, you are able to zoom, though while zooming you loose all volume (my camera cant zoom when filming).
3. One of the playback modes in the camera allows you to have special effects, complete with music while in playback mode.


I have to say, I was so pleasantly suprised by both the quality of the photos as well as the video quality.  I think that this is a fantastic little camera at a very affordable price, thats great for budding photo enthusiasts!

The accessory kit that it came with, was also just perfect, it came with the case, 2 rechargeable batteries and the charger - saving mad money on disposable batteries.  An excellent buy!

**UPDATE TO INITIAL REVIEW - this should be a 1star camera**

DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!! 
After only 5 mths of having it, it has stopped working (we can not turn it on), I also had recommended this camera to a friend of mine and hers stopped working within the same week as mine did - I am now going back to my trusted and true Fuji to buy a replacement for my son - what a waste of money!!

<Content>I own a Canon Power Shot that works perfectly but only had 3MP so decided to upgrade to a basic , 8MP camera . After searching the internet for reviews , I chose the Samsung S860 and was a bit diasspointed. 

I am far from an expert on taking digital pictures and pretty much rely on the Auto mode for most situations, but even that failed me at times .
Using anti-shake still sometimes resulted in a blurry, grainy photo and people with blue eyes still had red eyes in certain outdoor photos even when using red eye reduction.
Another complaint I have about the camera is that several times the lens got stuck  out and would not retract inward - the camera is only a few weeks old and I later researched this problem online and found a forum with seevral users experiencing the same issue . The answer was to remove the batteries ,reinsert them and power on and lens did indeed retract -  ok , problem solved, but I have concerns that this might be more of a problem as the camera ages so still thinking of returning it . 

Overall though , the majority of my shots were more than adequate for the price of the camera and there are a lot of features included for a budget priced 8 mp camera . If anyone has a suggestion for a better 8mp camera in this price range , that is for a basic, beginner photographer , I would certainly be interested in exchanging this one for that model .</Content>

Even someone who is professional photographer admit to me that your pics are pretty good (never told him about camera before showing pics). Everyday you can use camera for pics and easy to carry + plus battery life is good. You can take video of pretty good quality for amateurs. Also make sure you get rechargeable batteries which will save money and headache of running out of battery in middle of trip.  </Content>

<Content>I uploaded a grasshopper photo in the samples gallery for this camera. I was surprised to see it as sharp as the photos from my Digital SLRs, except some minor jpg artifacts in the blurred background. This photo was taken at full superbright Florida daylight, meaning short shutter speed and hight apperture value. This makes shake free images and long depth of field easy, even handheld. The camera was set to macro mode, with is a one-touch button and therefore quickly activated.

For professional photography I use a digital SLR, and I published books on Amazon with images from my digital SLRs. But those cameras are huge and heavy. This tiny samsung, in case logic strechy bag, is as small as a wallet. I used it for family trips, and to copy documents from pinboards. Much faster than writing down, or searching for a copy machine. Press the macro button, click done. Press the view button, zoom button, to check the image sharpness, off, done. For family photography its great. The skin tones come out natural. For long exposures just find a table, a fence post or use the ground, to hold the camera firmly with one hand, and press the shutter button with the other. Night shots of fireworks with 4 second exposure time are easy this way. Alkalines lasted 100 to 150 pics without flash. A 2GB SD holds almost 500 pics at 8MP. 

A little scary is, that the on button is not a slide, but a press for 2 seconds. The lens will zoom out, and if that happens inside a tight camera bag, will the lens mechnism survive this? Also, the camera switches on, whithout lens coming out, if pressing the play button. But it has a auto-off mode. 

One strange effect happened, when the batteries were low, but still working witout flash. When activating the flash, the camera switched off without pulling the lens in! Well, switching it on and off again pulled the lens in. Anyway, makes sense to always have an extra set of fresh batteries.

Using Lightroom to pull shadows or squeeze highlights is pretty much not of much use. This camera optimizes the image already pretty much to the maximum possible. And the dynamic resolution is just not there for further such editing. Be it due to sensor or A/D or jpg noise. 

I personally print from this camera 2 prints on one 4x6, so each print is 3x4, which matches the aspect ratio of the sensor, and also at this small size pretty much all images, handheld or not, are sharp.

Following is a link to my book about Suntan adjustment in Lightroom and Photoshop. This of cause only works when using Digital SLRs:

<Content>I purchased this camera for 89.99 at an electronics store so I mainly chose it for the value and the color. The one I have is a bright fuschia. The pictures are awesome! For once I do not have red eye in every picture. The one thing that I liked more about my old cheap Concord is that I found that the  menus are much simpler but it may be because I was used to them. This camera has the same menus Ive seen other people have, like the Kodak easy share and many other ones. The pictures are very clear and I dont know how I dealt with not having face recognition at all. Hopefully I dont break this camera. </Content>

<Content>The Samsung S860 is a low priced camera that is can produce clear images with vibrant colors, however results can be uneven and unsatisfactory.  Obtaining decent results, may require that you take some time to explore the cameras capabilities.     

Ideally, when set in auto mode, a camera should provide reliable results with a minimum amount of fuss and adjustment.  At this, the Samsung receives low marks.  In auto mode, I found that the cameras autofocus sometimes has issues.  It is very annoying to focus on the subject, lock on, and press the shutter button, only to have the camera fail to fire.  This seems to happen more often than average with the S860.  The results are a little better, using `Multi AF instead of `Center AF, but in this mode the camera can have problems with selecting the proper subject or focus area.  ISO is automatically set by the camera according to the lighting conditions.  Unfortunately, in low light situations, ISO is often set too low, resulting in blurry images.  Also annoying, is that the flash function defaults to red eye reduction mode.   So if you were in autoflash, or flash off mode when you turned the camera off, it will reset to red eye reduction the next time it is turned on.  Being in red eye mode is not the best place to be, if you want to take a photo quickly.            

Auto mode may be suitable for outdoor situations with good lighting, but the best option for normal use is probably `P (Program) mode.  ISO, white balance, sharpness and image quality can be adjusted in this mode.  The flash setting when the camera comes on is the same as when it was last turned off.  The focusing issues remain, but adjusting the ISO does improve the results.  However, when ISO is set to 800 or above, the camera takes 4 or 5 seconds to save the file to memory, and the noise in the images often increases significantly.      

In Manual mode your options are limited.  While a standard range of shutter speeds is available, only two aperture settings F2.8 and F8.4 can be selected.  The camera has many other modes and features, including macro and face detection.  The camera is capable of producing movies that are of acceptable quality, and you can get about half an hour of recording time on a 4GB card.  

The mode selection dial located on the top of the camera is too loose, and prone to being accidentally rotated (a small piece of adhesive tape is my simple solution).  Being familiar with Canon and Fuji cameras, I found the design and operation of the menu and settings not especially convenient to navigate.  The 2.4 LCD is clear, and has good visibility in a bright light, though it is very prone to smudging.  Useful information like battery level, memory level, ISO, flash setting, metering mode and face recognition function can be displayed.      

As with many other cameras, the zoom function is controlled by a toggling button, located at the top right corner, on the rear of the camera.  If the zoom control was located by the shutter button, it would be much easier to operate the camera using one hand.  It can be done, but is a bit awkward attempting this with the S860.  The wrist strap could really use a locking ring.  It is a very small thing that could go a long way, if it keeps you from dropping your camera even once.       

The camera has a USB connection, but is not recognized by a PC.  Rather than loading in Samsungs software, you can use a card reader to download images.  The S860 uses AA batteries.  Setting the camera in powersaver mode helps to increase battery life, but carrying spares is highly recommended.  Because it uses AA batteries, the camera isnt super thin, but having a readily available power source can be very convenient.  There is a quick start pamphlet, but no printed manual included.  Samsung has a manual in PDF format available at their website.                   

This is not a glowing review, but I already have several SLRs and point and shoots, and the S860 has enough good points, for me to decide to keep it as a walk around camera.  Even at the most basic mode, performance could definitely be better, but you do get a lot of features at a low price level.  As with any camera, it really depends on what is important to you, and how you like the results.  Feel is important as well, so getting one in your hands and trying it out, is always recommended.

<Content>I bought this camera two days before leaving on vacation, knowing I wanted something compact and easy to use.  It was perfect!  After 2 weeks of mountains and prairies, scenic overlooks and family visits, I plugged my camera into the computer and uploaded nearly 200 amazing pictures.  It works well both inside and out, in bright sun or overcast. Its small enough to carry in a purse or pocket, and so far appears pretty durable.  Even my kids were able to take pictures without cutting off the peoples heads!  I think this is an excellent camera, especially when the sale price drops it below $100.</Content>

<Content>This camera takes decent pictures. But if you just point and shoot without waiting for it to focus, the pictures will be blurry. Still, because of its price, it is good for kids to learn a little photography. Also, because it has only two AA batteries, taking pictures that requires flash is a bit slow.

UPDATE
Needs strong batteries. Duracells dont last long. Camera froze after one and a half months. Sent back to Samsung and had lens assembly and main board replaced. I had to pay for shipping. It should have two stars, but I could not change the rating.</Content>

<Content>I had a FujiFilm 7.3 megapixel camera ($149.99) and I dropped it and broke the lens.  Fuji was going to charge me almost the same to fix it.  So I thought I would spend that money on a better camera.  This camera is so wonderful.  It is an 8.1 megapixel and only cost me $88.00 total.  I am so happy with this camera.  It takes such clear, crisp pictures.  I have a 5 year old daughter and she doesnt like to sit still and the shutter speed is fast enough to where I can take a great picture of her before she moves.  It also takes wonderful videos, It has two different size of videos 640x480 and 320x240.  The videos are clear and the sound on it is awesome.  It has a few effects to add to your pictures too.  You can make your pictures, black and white, sepia, red, green, blue, negative, and you can customize your own color.  You can view your pictures in a slideshow right on the camera.  You can choose from 5 different slideshow effects and 3 different music tones.  It is really cool.  I love this camera so much.  It has a lot of great features for such a low price.  The face detection is great also, it lets you know if the face isnt in focus.  And it helps alot when you take a self portrait.  It is so easy to use.  My 5 yr. old daughter uses it without any problems.  She can change it from still pictures to video in a snap.  So if you are looking for a great camera that takes awesome pictures, awesome videos, for a low price...I suggest you give this camera a try.  You wont regret it.</Content>

<Content>The Samsung S860 has features I wanted.  It does not require a driver.  Cameras that require a driver for your computer generally provide them for Windows or Macintosh. As I use Linux, requiring a driver would be a show stopper.  Thats why I avoid Fuji and Kodak.  But even for people who use Windows, if youre at a friends house, take some pictures, and want to share them, if you need a driver, you may have to wait until you get home, and email them.

The S860 has a big preview screen, 3x zoom, is small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, and is cheap.  The 30 FPS 640x480 videos with sound are very nice.

On the down side, it does not have a see-through view finder, and this can make it difficult to take pictures in full sunlight.  Also, it needs a case - though this is easily fixed.

<Content>A nice camera at a nice price, the Samsung comes with almost no printed material. A quick start guide is all, and the huge manual in a dozen languages is on the software disc so that if you want to learn how to operate it in its many, many modes youre going to sit in front of your CRT and learn with Adobe Reader. Is that convenient? No.
It comes with almost no internal memory so right off you have to invest in an SD card; another $15 at least. Rechargable batteries/charger: another $10-15.
A very nice feature is the movie mode. The 3x zoom isnt as much as you may think, either. Theres no optical view-finder so be prepared to use the screen ALL the time and thus burn through batteries faster.
If youre looking for a point-and-shoot camera, this isnt it. If youre willing to spend hours reading the Adobe-based manual and playing with it to get the most out of its potential, Im sure it takes great photos. Why it needs so many choices just for the sound it makes when it alerts you to shutter or other things it does is beyond me. I think simplicity isnt in their vocabulary.</Content>

<Content>Great price/great photos... However, after only two weeks of occasional use...the lens retracts only when it feels like it...At least half the time when you turn it off you have to manually push the lens all the way back in...so you can fit it in your camera case.  Note when it first happened I thought possibly it just needed new batteries...however, no such luck, the same problem occurs with new batteries...

So, if you like the price, and dont mind the inconvenience of a sticky lens with a mind of its own...everything else with the camera appears to be OK...and the purchase may be to your liking.  </Content>

<Content>I needed a digital camera to take pictures of items for eBay listings. I didnt need anything amazing, just something that works and produces a clear image. I purchased this Samsung S860 because I have had good luck with Samsung products in the past and the price was sweet for how many megapixels it had. When I got it home, I fired it up and the first things I noticed was the staticky viewscreen. I could see what I was pointing at, but it was pretty fuzzy. Not a big deal so long as the picture quality was alright. The camera build quality also seemed very lacking. I felt like if I dropped it even a few inches it would crack and break. Doesnt feel nearly as sturdy as it looks on Amazon. The three pictures I took, two of them were acceptable and one of them either I didnt get the focus right or it didnt take a good picture. Im no master of a camera so its possible I just wasnt using it right. The buttons on the camera did not seem logical to a new user and I couldnt figure out how to delete pictures Ive taken without resorting to the manual. Up to this point, Im still satisfied though. I install the Samsung drivers on my PC so I can download my images. Plugging in the USB cable alerted me to a complete lack of quality in the plug itself. Its shaped so the plug can only go in one direction, but after the second time I tried plugging it in, the metal had become bent along with the prong on the inside. Still was able to get it to plug in, but now its too tight and I really have to look close and make sure its going in the right way. Still, I wasnt prepared to curse my purchase, so I left the camera on the USB plug overnight. When I took it off in the morning, I tried turning on the camera and all that happened was the lens extended out but the viewfinder did not turn on and the power light did not stay on. I tried turning it back off but nothing would happen, the lens was still extended. Removed the batteries to try again, and still nothing. The camera would no longer power on or completely power off. Very frustrated, I call Samsung technical support. They had me remove the batteries for 30 seconds and try again, and still nothing. But before they would be willing to service the camera, they told me I was going to have to buy new batteries and see if that fixes it. Sorry, but Im not spending any more money on this so I have already packaged it back up and am returning it to Amazon. I guess Im just going to have to spend more money on a different brand camera.

I didnt need much from this camera, but it failed to deliver even the basics, so I do not recommend this camera to anyone who wishes for more than a paperweight.</Content>

<Content>I normally dont do reviews on products that i buy, but in purchasing this camera I was thoroughly impressed. I have my camera for alittle over a month and it is truly a luxury having it. It is a great basic camera for the average photographer. It has the basic features that is necessary to capture everyday photos and it still has the quality to do much more. The in-camera help option allows the user to trouble-shoot any problems that might occur while in use. I found that to be extremely helpful especially with change in low-light and bright lighting areas. The auto flash and face recognition features are definetly and added bonus to the cameras already impressive design. 
One flaw that I would have to point out is that it does run off of AA battery which gets decent life out of, but can be annoying constantly searching for new ones. 
Overall the camera is a great buy, especially for the price. There are not many 8.1 Mp cameras out there that can offer everything that this one can...</Content>

<Content>June 12, 2008 I bought this camera yesterday and I am totally overjoyed with it. Before I bought this one and found the RIGHT CAMERA for me, I returned a Kodak Easy Share camera to the store. Why did I do this? Well, the Kodak took great pictures, however, when you shoot a movie (video) it is saved in the MOV mode on the Kodak (Apple format, not Microsoft). So you have to download Quicktime to play a movie in the MOV mode on a Windows PC! Not fun. I wanted both a camera that is easy to just point and shoot for stills and also wanted the AVI video output so when I downloaded my video card on to my PC, I can instantly watch my movies! I found this perfect camera for me with this cute pink Samsung! On my first day I found that the basics of this camera were easy to learn. I used mostly the AUTO mode, and the camera does the work for me in any light! I took some stills in daylight and then inside both from faraway and also some closeups of flowers in my garden with the micro setting and later did an indoor and outdoor video. Everything came out just beautiful and as soon as I loaded my computer with the videos, I watched them from my PC. Plan to put these on a DVD to watch on TV. So far this has been an easy camera to learn for just the basic features that I need. My favorite feature is the clear videos that are saved in the AVI mode, not in the MOV mode. This AVI mode plays perfectly in my computer the Vista Windows Media Player and saves great to watch on a DVD on my TV. Note, that there are so many settings, I just use the AUTO and the DIC for low light and anti shake. By the way, it seems easy to use and does great micro shots as well. This is my newest camera after updating my older HP camera from near 3 years ago with just a 5 pixels. Another great feature I love is the FACE RECOGNITION. I took several pictures of friends and they came out just perfectly, NO RED-EYE and SKIN TONES were perfect. (With my old HP 5 pixel, the skin tones came out too red). My advice if you are looking for a good basic camera that takes great stills and videos, this is the one for you!</Content>

<Content>I am thrilled with this camera that I bought for my 6 year old daughter. It takes great pictures even in automatic mode and shoots quality videos as well. One thing that is not working by some reason is face recognition. There is a button for this but I was never able to get it to work. Maybe its just defective item or maybe its flaw in the design, not sure, but otherwise the camera is a winner. It is very easy to change its resolution on a fly. Good ergonomics, easy to use menus.</Content>

<Content>The S860 has a decent feature set for a cheap camera, but beware the image quality.  At ISO80 in bright daylight, the S860 managed to introduce immense noise into reds.  I took 8 photos of a building with a red banner and had to run each of them through Noise Ninja to make them presentable.

<Content>   I bought this camera as an addition to our Minolta digital SLR, just to have a small and convenient point and shoot for times that I dont want to drag the SLR around.  

   Samsung has put together a very good camera for this price, and it has a couple of nice things beyond the basics.  I especially like the facial recognition feature, which makes sure that you actually get a focus on a person instead of sharp surroundings and a blurred human subject.  The menus are very easy to use, and the camera itself takes very good action shots.  There are eleven different photo settings from which to choose.  It also takes small video clips.  The photo quality is excellent and you can print up to poster size and maintain that quality.  It is an 8.1 megapixel camera with a 3x optical zoom and a 3x digital zoom.

   The body of the camera itself is small and compact, and it easily fits into standard blue jean pockets.  It has a nice, solid feel to it and since I have small hands, its very comfortable for me to use.  A person with very large hands may want something bigger for ergonomic reasons.

   The only down side to this camera is that you have to use the LCD screen to take your shot.  There is no standard view finder.  The LCD screen itself, however, is very large and extremely crisp.  

   This is an excellent camera if you are looking for a basic point and shoot with a few added perks beyond the most basic category.  If you are looking for a camera with tons of settings, features and major zoom ability, you need to look elsewhere.  However, for basic everyday use, Samsung has really put out a great product in the S860.</Content>
